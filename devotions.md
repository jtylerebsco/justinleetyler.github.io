## In the Morning
### From Psalm 51
Open my lips, O Lord, *
    and my mouth shall proclaim your praise.
Create in me a clean heart, O God, *
    and renew a right spirit within me.
Cast me not away from your presence *
    and take not your holy Spirit from me.
Give me the joy of your saving help again *
    and sustain me with your bountiful Spirit.
Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *
    as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. Amen. 

### A Reading

Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ!
By his great mercy we have been born anew to a living hope
through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.
1 Peter 1:3

### A period of silence may follow.

### A hymn or canticle may be used 
Glory to God in the highest, 
    and peace to his people on earth. 
Lord God, heavenly King, 
almighty God and Father, 
    we worship you, we give you thanks, 
    we praise you for your glory. 
Lord Jesus Christ, only Son of the Father, 
Lord God, Lamb of God, 
you take away the sin of the world: 
    have mercy on us; 
you are seated at the right hand of the Father: 
    receive our prayer. 
For you alone are the Holy One, 
you alone are the Lord, 
you alone are the Most High,
    Jesus Christ, 
    with the Holy Spirit, 
    in the glory of God the Father. Amen.

### The Apostles' Creed may be said.
I believe in God, the Father almighty, 
    creator of heaven and earth; 
I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord. 
    He was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit 
        and born of the Virgin Mary. 
    He suffered under Pontius Pilate, 
        was crucified, died, and was buried. 
    He descended to the dead. 
    On the third day he rose again. 
    He ascended into heaven, 
        and is seated at the right hand of the Father. 
    He will come again to judge the living and the dead. 
I believe in the Holy Spirit, 
    the holy catholic Church, 
    the communion of saints, 
    the forgiveness of sins
    the resurrection of the body, 
    and the life everlasting. Amen. 
    
### Prayers may be offered for ourselves and others.

### The Lord's Prayer
Our Father, who art in heaven,
     hallowed be thy Name, 
     thy kingdom come, 
     thy will be done, 
         on earth as it is in heaven. 
Give us this day our daily bread. 
And forgive us our trespasses, 
     as we forgive those 
         who trespass against us. 
And lead us not into temptation, 
     but deliver us from evil. 
For thine is the kingdom, 
     and the power, and the glory, 
     for ever and ever. Amen.   

### The Collect
Lord God, almighty and everlasting Father, you have brought
us in safety to this new day: Preserve us with your mighty
power, that we may not fall into sin, nor be overcome by
adversity; and in all we do, direct us to the fulfilling of your
purpose; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

# Daily Devotions

Glory be to the earth and the wind.
Glory be to the sun and the rain.
Glory be to animals and children and women and men,
Glory be to our holy flame which calls us together as one.

From all that dwell below the skies *
    Let faith and hope with love arise;
Let beauty, truth and good be sung *
   Through every land, by every tongue.
   
¶ [A reading](http://community.fortunecity.ws/roswell/vortex/401/library/365/365date.htm)

¶ A period of silece or reflection may follow.

¶ A [hymn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjFjxRdzuJc) may be sung

Tis a gift to be simple, 'tis a gift to be free
'Tis a gift to come down where I ought to be
And when we find in the place just right
we'll be in the valley of love and delight
When true simplicity is gained
To bow and to bend we will not be ashamed
To turn, to turn will be our delight
'Til by turning, turning, we come 'round right.

¶ A covenant may be said

Love is the doctrine of this church,
The quest of truth is its sacrament,
And service is its prayer.
To dwell together in peace,
To seek knowledge of freedom,
To serve human need,To the end that all souls shall grow into harmony with the Divine --
Thus do we covenant with each other and with God.
(James Vila Blake)
  -or-
Seek the truth, and serve humanity

¶ Prayers may be offered for ourselves and others.

This chalice burns for [name], and for those who affirm and promote [principle].

¶ The Lords Prayer

Form One: Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy Name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory, now and forever. Amen.

Form Two: Oh thou, whose kingdom is within, may all thy names by hallowed. May no one of them be turned against the others to divide those who address thee. May thy presence be made known to us in mercy, beauty, love, and justice. May thy kingdom come to be in the life of all humankind. May it come with peace, with sharing, and in a near time. Give us this day our daily bread, free from all envy and alienation, broken and blessed in the sharing. Keep us from trespass against others, and from the feeling that others are trespassing against us. Forgive us more than we have forgiven. Deliver us from being tempted by lesser things to be heedless of the one great thing: the give of thyself in us. -Jacob Trapp

¶ The Benediction

Live simply, expect little, give much. Fill your life with love, seek sunshine. Forget self. Think of others, and do as you would be done by. 
   
   -or-

Eternal Spirit, whom we call God, you are our life. You are the best and most beautiful in us and beyond us. Your spirit is in animals, birds, plants, and in people whom we do not know or who seem very different from us. All of us share the gift of life. Help us to remember that life is good. Help us to know that we don't stop loving people or other living things when they are no longer close to us. Love lasts always. May we look for ways to love one another, and to love all living things. Amen. (Licinda Steven Duncan)
