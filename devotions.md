¶ A reading [365 Tao](http://community.fortunecity.ws/roswell/vortex/401/library/365/365date.htm)  [daily psalms)(https://www.bcponline.org/Psalter/psalter_30day.html) [Earth bound](https://read.amazon.com/?asin=B0064P9UQ0)
Our unitarian heritage calls us to recognize the inherent good in all persons, while the universal part of our tradition encourages us to extend love and acceptance to all people.

¶ A period of silece or reflection may follow.

¶ A [hymn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjFjxRdzuJc) may be sung

Tis a gift to be simple, 'tis a gift to be free /
'Tis a gift to come down where we ought to be /
And when we find ourselves in the place just right /
we'll be in the valley of love and delight /
When true simplicity is gained /
To bow and to bend we won't be ashamed /
To turn, to turn will be our delight /
'Til by turning, turning, we come 'round right. /

¶ A covenant may be said

Love is the doctrine of this church,
The quest of truth is its sacrament,
And service is its prayer.
To dwell together in peace,
To seek knowledge of freedom,
To serve human need. To the end that all souls shall grow into harmony with the Divine --
Thus do we covenant with each other and with God.
(James Vila Blake)   

¶ Prayers may be offered for ourselves and others.
  
¶ The prayer of Jesus [traditional](https://www.missionstclare.com/english/prayers/lords.html)

Oh thou, whose kingdom is within, may all thy names by hallowed. May no one of them be turned against the others to divide those who address thee. May thy presence be made known to us in mercy, beauty, love, and justice. May thy kingdom come to be in the life of all humankind. May it come with peace, with sharing, and in a near time. Give us this day our daily bread, free from all envy and alienation, broken and blessed in the sharing. Keep us from trespass against others, and from the feeling that others are trespassing against us. Forgive us more than we have forgiven. Deliver us from being tempted by lesser things to be heedless of the one great thing: the give of thyself in us. (Jacob Trapp)

¶ The Benediction

Live simply, expect little, give much. Fill your life with love, scatter sunshine. Forget self. Think of others, and do as you would be done by.
