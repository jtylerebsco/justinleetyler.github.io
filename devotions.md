# DAILY DEVOTIONS

This chalice burns for those who affirm and promote [principle]. May we tend this fire always; ever vigilant and courageous.

Our unitarian heritage calls us to recognize the inherent good in all persons, while the universal part of our tradition encourages us to extend love and acceptance to all people.

¶ A period of silece or reflection may follow.

¶ A [hymn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjFjxRdzuJc) may be sung

Tis a gift to be simple, 'tis a gift to be free /
'Tis a gift to come down where we ought to be /
And when we find ourselves in the place just right /
we'll be in the valley of love and delight /
When true simplicity is gained /
To bow and to bend we won't be ashamed /
To turn, to turn will be our delight /
'Til by turning, turning, we come 'round right. /

¶ A covenant may be said

Love is the doctrine of this church,
The quest of truth is its sacrament,
And service is its prayer.
To dwell together in peace,
To seek knowledge of freedom,
To serve human need. To the end that all souls shall grow into harmony with the Divine --
Thus do we covenant with each other and with God.
(James Vila Blake)

Druidry is a path of nature-based spirituality. To druids, nature is both our sacred text and our sanctuary. While the druid tradition is diverse, it can trace its roots back to the druid revival some 350 years ago with inspiration in much more ancient sources. Today's druid tradition focuses on three tracks: the bardic arts, where we channel the flow of awen and embrace creative practices; the ovate arts, which focus on plant and animal lore, herbs, understanding the world, and more; and the druid arts, which focus on mysticism and oak knowledge. As a druid, I work to integrate my spiritual path with daily living, primarily through the practice of permaculture and sustainable living. -Dana Driscal

¶ Prayers may be offered for ourselves and others.
  
¶ The Druids Prayer

Grant, O holy ones, thy protection; And in protection, strength; And in strength, understanding; And in understanding, knowledge; And in knowledge, the knowledge of justice; And in the knowledge of justice, the love of it; And in that love, the love of all existences; And in the love of all existences, the love of Earth our mother and all goodness. AWEN. 

¶ The Benediction

Live simply, expect little, give much. Fill your life with love, scatter sunshine. Forget self. Think of others, and do as you would be done by.
