**Cruciform Bead**
From all that dwell below the skies / Let faith and hope with love arise / Let beauty, truth and good be sung / Through every land, by every tongue.

**Closing Invitatory Bead**
Eternal Spirit, whom we call God, you are our life.
You are the best and most beautiful in us and beyond us.
Your spirit is in animals, birds, plants, and in people whom
we do not know or who seem very different from us.
All of us share the gift of life.
Help us to remember that life is good.
Help us to know that we don't stop loving people or other living
things when they are no longer close to us.
Love lasts alwyas.
May we look for ways to love one another, and to love all living things.
Amen.
(Licinda Steven Duncan)

# Daily Devotions

Glory be to the earth and the wind.
Glory be to the sun and the rain.
Glory be to animals and children and women and men,
Glory be to our holy flame which calls us together as one.

From all that dwell below the skies *
    Let faith and hope with love arise;
Let beauty, truth and good be sung *
   Through every land, by every tongue.
   
¶ [A reading](http://community.fortunecity.ws/roswell/vortex/401/library/365/365date.htm)

¶ A period of silece or reflection may follow.

¶ A [hymn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjFjxRdzuJc) may be sung

Tis a gift to be simple, 'tis a gift to be free
'Tis a gift to come down where I ought to be
And when we find in the place just right
we'll be in the valley of love and delight
When true simplicity is gained
To bow and to bend we will not be ashamed
To turn, to turn will be our delight
'Til by turning, turning, we come 'round right.

¶ A covenant may be said

Love is the doctrine of this church,
The quest of truth is its sacrament,
And service is its prayer.
To dwell together in peace,
To seek knowledge of freedom,
To serve human need,To the end that all souls shall grow into harmony with the Divine --
Thus do we covenant with each other and with God.
(James Vila Blake)
  -or-
Seek the truth, and serve humanity

¶ Prayers may be offered for ourselves and others.

This chalice burns for [name], and for those who affirm and promote [principle].

¶ The Lords Prayer

Form One: Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy Name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory, now and forever. Amen.

Form Two: Oh thou, whose kingdom is within, may all thy names by hallowed. May no one of them be turned against the others to divide those who address thee. May thy presence be made known to us in mercy, beauty, love, and justice. May thy kingdom come to be in the life of all humankind. May it come with peace, with sharing, and in a near time. Give us this day our daily bread, free from all envy and alienation, broken and blessed in the sharing. Keep us from trespass against others, and from the feeling that others are trespassing against us. Forgive us more than we have forgiven. Deliver us from being tempted by lesser things to be heedless of the one great thing: the give of thyself in us. -Jacob Trapp

¶ The Benediction

Live simply, expect little, give much. Fill your life with love, seek sunshine. Forget self. Think of others, and do as you would be done by.

Help us to know that we don't stop loving people or other living things when they are no longer close to us. Love lasts always. May we look for ways to love one another, and to love all living things. Amen. (Licinda Steven Duncan)
