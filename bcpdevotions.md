The Collect
Lord God, almighty and everlasting Father, you have brought us in safety to this new day: Preserve us with your mighty power, that we may not fall into sin, nor be overcome by adversity; and in all we do, direct us to the fulfilling of your purpose; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.


Glory to God    Gloria in excelsis 
Glory to God in the highest, 
    and peace to his people on earth. 
Lord God, heavenly King, 
almighty God and Father, 
    we worship you, we give you thanks, 
    we praise you for your glory. 
Lord Jesus Christ, only Son of the Father, 
Lord God, Lamb of God, 
you take away the sin of the world: 
    have mercy on us; 
you are seated at the right hand of the Father: 
    receive our prayer. 
For you alone are the Holy One, 
you alone are the Lord, 
you alone are the Most High,
    Jesus Christ, 
    with the Holy Spirit, 
    in the glory of God the Father. Amen.
	
21    You are God   Te Deum laudamus 
You are God: we praise you; 
You are the Lord; we acclaim you; 
You are the eternal Father: 
All creation worships you. 
To you all angels, all the powers of heaven, 
Cherubim and Seraphim, sing in endless praise: 
    Holy, holy, holy Lord, God of power and might,
    heaven and earth are full of your glory. 
The glorious company of apostles praise you. 
The noble fellowship of prophets praise you. 
The white-robed army of martyrs praise you. 
Throughout the world the holy Church acclaims you; 
    Father, of majesty unbounded, 
    your true and only Son, worthy of all worship,
    and the Holy Spirit, advocate and guide. 
You, Christ, are the king of glory, 
the eternal Son of the Father. 
When you became man to set us free 
you did not shun the Virgin's womb. 
You overcame the sting of death 
and opened the kingdom of heaven to all believers. 
You are seated at God's right hand in glory. 
We believe that you will come and be our judge. 
    Come then, Lord, and help your people, 
    bought with the price of your own blood, 
    and bring us with your saints 
    to glory everlasting. 
	
The Apostles' Creed
Officiant and People together, all standing
I believe in God, the Father almighty, 
    creator of heaven and earth; 
I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord. 
    He was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit 
        and born of the Virgin Mary. 
    He suffered under Pontius Pilate, 
        was crucified, died, and was buried. 
    He descended to the dead. 
    On the third day he rose again. 
    He ascended into heaven, 
        and is seated at the right hand of the Father. 
    He will come again to judge the living and the dead. 
I believe in the Holy Spirit, 
    the holy catholic Church, 
    the communion of saints, 
    the forgiveness of sins
    the resurrection of the body, 
    and the life everlasting. Amen.
