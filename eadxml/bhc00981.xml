      <p>Frederick Bellinger, born in Rushville, Indiana, was the son of Reverend Martin Luther Jones and Annie Mae Battle Bellinger. Frederick fell in love with music, especially choral music, at the age of twelve. At that time he began singing lessons at the Detroit Institute of Musical Arts. He also studied with Josephine Hanell Love and Nellie Beatrice Hugher Ebersole. At Hutchins Intermediate (Junior High) he took part in memorable musical productions such as H. M. S. Captain Pinafore. He continued in his music and graduated from Cass Technical High School in Detroit, Michigan. Additional formal education includes a B. A. Degree in Elementary and Secondary Music Education from Philander Smith College, Little Rock Arkansas. While attending Philander Smith College, he traveled with the Philander Smith Collegiate Choir to different states promoting the college. His graduate work was done at Indiana State Teachers College, Terre Haute. Indiana and Michigan State University, Lansing Michigan. Frederick began his teaching career in Florida where he taught several years in Lake City. Later he returned to Pontiac, Michigan where he taught in the Pontiac Public Schools and founded his own choral organization, the Bell Chorale. The Bell Chorale was made up of people from the community and all walks of life. They performed, at times under the auspices of the Pontiac Parks and Recreation Department, performing at numerous community affairs held at schools and other occasions such as Ground breaking ceremonies, memorial services, special services for organizations such as the Urban League, sorority sponsored programs, and scholarship benefit programs in the Pontiac and Detroit areas. Gilbert Jackson was the accompanist for the Bell Chorale. During the 1960s and 1970s, Frederick was active with the Wayne State University Opera Workshop and Celeste Cole Opera Workshop appearing often as Tenor Soloist in the productions. In the 1970s he appeared as guest soloist with the Detroit Symphony. During this period as a member of the Kenneth Jewell Chorale Tenor section, Frederick was soloist and on occasion Assistant Director. The Kenneth Jewell Chorale performed with area orchestras including the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, the Dearborn Symphony Orchestra, Plymouth Symphony Orchestra, and choirs such as Interlochen Academy Choir, Rackham Symphony Choir and Cantata Academy. Kenneth Jewell Concerts were given throughout the Detroit area at churches, on college and university campuses, at conferences, festivals and an important participant of series such as Bach at Cranbrook and Music at Westminster Series. In 1970, Frederick, after teaching music in Pontiac Public Schools, began teaching at Cranbrook Schools, Bloomfield, Michigan where he taught for 30 years. An editorial by Josh Steinman and Emily Bate states that Mr. "B", as he was lovingly addressed on campus, was known to push students to excel, while having understanding and compassion for their needs outside of class, and me producing consistently remarkable ensembles. Frederick Bellinger joined Cantata Academy under Conductor, Arthur Stephan as a chorus member while singing with the Kenneth Jewell Chorale. In the mid 1960s he soon became Vocal Soloist and the Assistant Conductor. In the 1971-1972 season, he was appointed Music Director and Conductor of Cantata Academy. Under his direction Cantata Academy continued to grow in number and had done at least 12 European Concert tours. Programs ranging from classical and sacred to popular and secular. In 1991, celebrating the 30th Anniversary of Cantata Academy, Peter Beerwerth, the Consulate General of the Federal Republic of Germany wrote a congratulatory letter to Frederick and the Cantata Academy. Beerwerth noted over the years, through the German tours, Cantata developed contacts with a sizable number of German Choirs. Thereby, playing an active role in the cultural exchange between the two countries. Most of Cantata Academy concerts included a segment of Negro Spirituals. During Frederick's soloist period, he would often sing "This Little Light of Mine" during a concert at or near the end. He lived this song with great commitment, love and passion. Throughout his life Frederick was an avid supporter of public and private school musical activities, out-of-town choirs, local choir concerts, local and visiting artists, area churches, the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, the Detroit Opera House, and music associations to which he belonged. Prior to his passing on May 28, 2000 Frederick Bellinger was Conductor Emeritus of Cantata Academy, Choral Vocalist Instructor at Cranbrook schools, Bloomfield Hills Michigan, Choirmaster at Christ Church Dearborn, a member of the American Guild of Organists, the Association of Anglican Musicians, the Michigan School Vocal Association, and the Omega Psi Phi Faternity.</p>
