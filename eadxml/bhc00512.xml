She has two maids you know — Aunt Patsy's daughters - One Sunday afternoon even, hearing voices in the kitchen &amp; seeing that Sarah did not go down she asked Caroline (her sister) why it was — 'Oh ma'am says she 'Sarah is engaged, she don't keep gentlements company' 'Indeed, says Anne, pray who is she engaged to' A young gentleman that lives at Frankfort - Oh! Miss Anne he sent Sarah such a beautiful locket with a picture in it' —`whose picture' says Anne —'his own?' —'Oh no ma'am, Mr. Henry Clay's cut little to fit it' — Need I tell you with what roars of laughter we greeted Caroline's account of Sarah's love affair. But the manner &amp; the language! could you have heard that. Tell Mr. Rowland he may judge from this of Mr. Clay's popularity in Kentucky — that the very negro girls wear his 'picture' round their necks!"</p>

                    <p>Page 1: "1 have just returned from a visit to the Gallery of the Senate Chamber, ...the Senators have had quite an angry discussion today in respect to the printers of the Senate Blair &amp; Rives. Messr. Clay, Calhoun, Preston, King, Smith, Huntington and one or two others took part in the debate. The remarks of Mr. King of Alabama where [sic] rather uncorteus [sic] &amp; vindictive towards Clay which brought that gentleman upon the floor, absolutely using up King; Clay on setting [sic] down observed with some emphasis, that the remarks of the gentleman from Alabama, were unkind, not those of a gentleman (or something to that effect) and cowardly. Mr. King imputing probably [sic] a different meaning to the last part of the sentence, is said to have written a challenge to Clay, but I do not place much truth in it myself, I hope nothing of that kind will take place, the subject of the debate will be taken up again in the morning, the great guns of both parties are a going to 'throw themselves' on the occasion, and an angry discussion is expected. It looks rather dark about war, but the best policy is peace, and as Webster has the helm (Being now Secretary of State) he will undoubtedly do right without sacrificing [sic] his country in the least iota. The M'leod affair looks the worst at present, but hope it will, be finally, properly adjusted."</p>
