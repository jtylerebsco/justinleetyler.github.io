<p>Being a Unitarian Universalist, and needing an active contemplative life, I wrote a series of prayer bead, devotional, and canodical hour rites for my use. I make my breviary public, and offer it to you for your use. Since freedom and respect of belief is a basic principle of the Unitarian Universalist faith, you are welcome customize it in the way you must to seek and listen to the holy in your life.
 
If you choose to use it, then I would love to hear from you (justinleetyler@yahoo.com)!
 
Peace,
Justin

<h2>An Order of Worship for a Chalice-lighting</h2>

<small style="color:red">All stand, and the Officiant greets the people with these words.<br></small style="color:red">

<p><i>Officiant:</i>Rise up, o Flame, by thy light glowing
<br><i>People:</i> Show to us vision, beauty, and joy</td>

<p>

<small style="color:red">One of the following, or some other introduction or short quote appropriate to the occasion or to the season, may then be read<br></small style="color:red">

<p>
Holy and beautiful the custom which brings us together [in the presence of the Most High]: To face our ideals, to remember our loved ones in absence, to give thanks, to make confession, to offer forgiveness, to be enlightened, and to be strenthened. Through this quiet hour breathes the worship of ages, the cathedral music of history. Three unseen guests attend, Faith, Hope and Love. Let our our hearts prepare them place. <span class="verse">Robert French Leavens</span>
</p>

<small style="color:red">The Officiant, together with the people, then says these words, or some other suitable words</small style="color:red">

<p>
Glory be to the earth and the wind.<br>
   Glory be to the sun and the rain.<br>
   Glory be to animals and children and women and men,<br>
   Glory be to our holy flame which calls us together as one.
</p>

<small style="color:red">
The chalice is now lit, as are other candles and lamps as may be convenient. During the chalice-lighting, an appropriate anthem or responsive reading may be sung, or silence kept. The following hymn, or a metrical version of it, or some other hymn, is then sung 
<p>
</small style="color:red">

Come, come, whoever you are<br>
  Wonderer, Worshiper, lover of leaving<br>
Ours is no fellowship of despair, <br>
  Come, yet again come.<br>

  <p>
<small style="color:red">
The people sit. The service may then continue in any of the following ways:
<br>
With a devotion, beginning with the responsive reading
<br>
With the usual Sunday Service, beginning after the chalice lighting.
<br>
* Or, it may be followed by a meal or other activity, in which case hymn may be followed by the Prayer of Jesus and a grace or blessing;
</small style="color:red">


<hr>
<h2>Daily Devotions for use in Unitarian Circles</h2>

<small style="color:red">These devotions follow the basic structure of the ancient Daily Office of the Christian Church.
<br>
When more than one person is present, the Reading and the Benediction should be read by one person, and the other parts said in unison, or in some other convenient manner.
<br>
For convenience, liturgical texts are provided in each service. When desired, however, other words may be used instead.

<p>For the sun and the dawn which we did not create
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the moon and the evening which we did not make;
<br>For food which we plant but cannot grow;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For friends and loved ones we have not earned and cannot buy;
<br>For this gathered company which welcomes us as we are, from wherever we have come;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all our free churches that keep us human and encourage us in our quest for beauty, truth, and love;
<br>For all things which come to us as gifts of being from sources beyond ourselves;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gifts of life and love and friendship. We lift our hearts in thanks this day.

<summary><em>At noon</em> </summary>
Why should we live in such a hurry and waste of life?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are determined to be starved before we are hungry.
<br>I wish to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to learn what life has to teach, and not, when I come to die, discover that I have not lived.
<br>I do not wish to live what is not life, living is so dear,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor do I wish to practice resignation, unless it is quite necessary.
<br>I wish to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to cut a broad swath, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms.
<br>If it proves to be mean, then to get he whole and genuine meanness of it, and publish its meanness to the world;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or if it is sublime, to know it by experience, and to be able to give a true account of it.
<br>(Henry David Thoreau)

<summary><em>In the evening</em></summary>
    I am glad I came into this world able to think and reason
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad I came into this world able to feel pain and pleasure, sorry and joy, anger and love.
<br>I am glad I am able to heal, both physically and mentally able to be aware, to grow and to change.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad I am able to respond to love, beauty and truth: able to discern reality, face it, accept it.
<br>I am glad I came into this world able to feel with others, to care for others.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad I came into this world unique and singular.
<br>I am glad I came into this world as an unfinished creature, moving towards completion.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I give thanks for the many gifts of life. I am glad I came into this world.

Spirit of Community, in which we share and find strength and common purpose, we turn our minds and hearts toward one another seeking to bring into our circle of concern all who need our love and support: those who are ill, those who are in pain, either in body or in spirit, those who are lonely, those who have been wronged. 
[Here, people may say the names of those to be remembered]. 
We are part of a web of life that makes us one with all humanity, one with all the universe. We are grateful for the miracle of consciousness that we share, the consciousness that gives us the power to remember, to love, to care. Amen.

<summary><em>Confession</em></summary>
<p>The years of all of us are short, our lives precarious.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our days and nights go hurrying on and there is scarcely time to do the little that we might.
<br>Yet we find time for bitterness, for petty treason and evasion.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can we do to stretch our hearts enough to lose their littleness?
<br>Here we are - all of us - all upon this planet, bound together in a common destiny,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Living our lives between the briefness of the daylight and the dark.
<br>Kindred in this, each lighted by the same precarious, flickering flame of life, how does it happen that we are not kindred in all things else?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How strange and foolish are the walls of separation that divide us!

<p><em>The Prayer of Jesus</em> </p>

		<p>Form One: Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy Name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those  who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory, now and forever. Amen.

		<p>Form Two: Oh thou, whose kingdom is within, may all thy names by hallowed.  May no one of them be turned against the others  to divide those who address thee. May thy presence be made known to us  in mercy, beauty, love, and justice. May thy kingdom come to be in the life  of all humankind. May it come with peace, with sharing,  and in a near time. Give us this day our daily bread,  free from all envy and alienation,  broken and blessed in the sharing. Keep us from trespass against others, and from the feeling that others are  trespassing against us. Forgive us more than we have forgiven. Deliver us from being tempted by lesser things  to be heedless of the one great thing: the give of thyself in us.  -Jacob Trapp
						
		<p>Form Three: Eternal Spirit, whom we call God, you are our life. You are the best and most beautiful in us and beyond us. Your spirit is in animals, birds, plants, and in people whom we do not know or who seem very different from us. All of us share the gift of life. Help us to remember that life is good. Help us to know that we don't stop loving people or other living things when they are no longer close to us. Love lasts always. May we look for ways to love one another, and to love all living things. Amen. (Licinda Steven Duncan)
		
<p><em>The Benediction</em></p>

<p>May the light around us guide our footsteps, and hold us fast to the best and most righteous that we seek.
<br>Let us seek to remember the wholeness of our lives, the weaving of light and shadow in this great and astonishing dance in which we move.
<br>May the darkness around us nurture our dreams, and give us rest so that we may give ourselves to the work of our world. <em>Amen.</em> 
<span class="verse">(Kathleen McTigue)</span>
</p>

		<h3>Canticles</h3>
		[33. Sovereign and Transforming Grace. 7.7.7.7.]
		
			Sovereign and transforming Grace,
			we invoke your uickening power;
			reign and spirit of this place,
			bless the purpose of this hour.
			
			Holy and Creative Light,
			we invoke your kindling ray;
			stir the dull and hardened heart;
			as the darkness turns to day.
			
			To the anxious sould impart
			hope, all other hope above;
			stir the dull and hardened heart
			with a longing and a love.
		
		[48. Again, as Evening's Shadow Falls. L.M.
			Again, as evening's shadow falls,
			gather in these hallowed walls;
			and vesper hymn and vester prayer
			raise mingling on the holy air.
			
			May struggling hearts that seek release here
			find the rest of God's own:
			and, strengthened here by hymn and prayer,
			lay down the burden and the care.
			
			Life's turmult we must meet again; we
			cannot at the shrine remian;
			but in the spirit's secret call
			may hymn and prayer forever dwell.
			
		[65. The Sweet June Days. C.M.D.
			The swet june days are come again;
			 once more the glad earth yeilds 
			its golden wealth of ripning grain,
			 and breath of of clover fields,
			and deepning shad of summer woods,
			 and glow of summer air,
			and winging thoughs and happy moods
			 of love and joy and prayer
			 
			The swee June days are come again,
			 the birds are on the wing;
			bright anthems, in their mercy strain,
			 unconsciously they sing.
			Oh, how our cup o'erbrims with good
			 these happy summer days,
			for all the joys of field and wood 
			 we lift our song of prise.
		
		[90. From All hte Fret and Fever of the Day. 10.10.10.10.]
			
			From all the fret and fever of hte day,
			let there be moments when we turn away,
			and, deaf to all confusing outer din,
			intently listen for the voice within.
			
			In quietness and solitude we find
			the soundless wisdom of the deeper mind;
			with clear harmonious purpose let us then
			bring richer meaning to the world within.			
		
		[96. I Cannot Think of Them as Dead. 8.6.8.6.6.]
			
			I cannot think of them as dead
			who walk with me no more;
			along the path of life I tread
			they are but gone before,
			they are but gone before.
			
			And still their silent ministry
			within my heart has place 
			as when on earth they walked with me 
			and met me face to face
			and met me face to face
			
			Their lives are made forever mine;
			what they to me have been
			has left henceforth its seal and sign
			engraven deep within
			engraven deep within
			
			Mine are they by an ownership 
			nor time nor death can free;
			but God has given to live 
			to keep its own eternally,
			is own eternally.
		
		[118. This Little Light of Mine. Lattimer]
			
			This little light of mine,
			I'm gonna let it shine.
			This Little light of mine,
			I'm goona let it shine.
			This little Light of mine,
			I'm goona let it shine.
			Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine.
			
			Ev'rywhere I go,
			I'm gonna let it shine.
			Ev'rywhere I go,
			I'm gonna let it shine.
			Ev'rywhere I go,
			I'm gonna let it shine.
			Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine.
			
			Building up a world,
			I'm gonna let it shine.
			Building up a world,
			I'm gonna let it shine.
			Building up a world,
			I'm gonna let it shine.
			Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine.
			
		[126. Come, Thou Fount of Every Blesing. Nettleton.]
		
			Come, tho fount of every blessing,
			tune our hearts to sing thy grace.
			Sreams of merry never ceasing,
			call for songs of loudest praise.
			While the hope of life's perfection
			fills our hears with joy and love,
			teach us ever to be faithful,
			may we still thy goodness prove.
			
			Come, though fount of every vision,
			lift our eyes to what may come.
			See the lion and the young lamb 
			dwell ogether in thy home.
			Hear the cries of war fall silent,
			feel our love grow like the sun.
			When we all serve one another,
			then our heaven is begun.
			
			Come, though fount of inspiration, 
			turn our lives to higher ways.
			Lift our gloom and desperation, 
			show the promise of this day
			Help us bind ourselves in union,
			help our hands tell of our love.
			With thine aid, O fount of justice,
			earth be fair to heaven above.
		
		[147. When All the Peoples on this Earth. L.M.]
			
			When all the peoples on this earth
			know dep inside thier precious worth,
			when every single soul is free, 
			we'll earth the name Humanity.
			
			The choice to be the best we can 
			begins the day we say, "I am."
			the unity for which we sigh
			will never come through hate or lie.
			
			The lights of Kwanzaa now proclaim 
			that when we share our inner flame
			and nurture root and branch with pride,
			we'll harvest peace both far and wide.
		
		[164. The Peace Not Past Our Understanding. 10.10.10.10.]
		
			The peace not past our understanding falls
			like light upon the soft white tablecloth
			at winter supper warm between four walls,
			a thing too simple to be tried as truth.
			
			Not scholar's calm, nor gift of church or state,
			nor everlasting date of death's release;
			but careless noon, the houses lighted late,
			harvest and holiday: the people's peace.
			
			Days into years, the doorways worn at sill,
			years into lives, the plans for long increase 
			come true at last for those of God's good will:
			these are the things we mean by saying, Peace.
			
		[188. Come, come, Whoever you are. Pilgrimage]
		
			Come, come, whoever you are,
			wonder, worshiper, lover of leaving.
			Ours is no caravan of despair.
			Come, yet again come.
			
		[203. All Creatures of the Earth and Sky. 8.8.4.4.8.8. with Alleluias]

			All creatures of the earth and sky
			 Come, Kindred, lift your voices high
			  Alleluia, Alleluia
			Bright burning sun with glolden beam
			 Soft shining moon with softer gleam
			  Alleluia, Alleluia
			Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia
			
			Cool flowing water, pure and clean
			make music for all life to hear
			Alleluia, Alleluia
			Dance, fire of flame, so strong and bright
			and bless us with your warmth and light
			Alleluia, Alleluia
			Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia
			
			All you of understanding heart
			forgiving others, take your part
			Alleluia, Alleluia 
			Let all things now the holy bless
			And worship God in humbleness
			Alleluia, Alleluia 
			Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia
			
			Grant us thy truth to make us free
			And kindling hearts that burn for thee
			Alleluia, Alleluia!
			Till all hty living altars burn
			One holy light, one heavenly flame
			Alleluia, Alleluia
			Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.

		[240. I heard the Bells on Christmas Day. L.M.
		
			I heard the bells on Christmas Day
			their old familiar carols play,
			and wild and sweet the words repeat
			of peace on earth, to all goodwill.
			
			I thought how, as the day had come, 
			the belfries of all Christendom had 
			rolled along thunderbroken song
			of peace on earth, to all goodwill.
			
			And in despair I bowed my head:
			"There is no peace on earth,"
			I said, "for hate is strong and mocks the song 
			peace on earth, to all goodwill."
			
			Then pealed the bells more load and deep:
			"God is not dead, nor doth od sleep;
			the rong shall fail, the reight prevail,
			with peace on earth, to all goodwill.
			
			Till, ringing, singing on its way,
			the world revolved from day to day,
			a voice, a chime, a chant sublime
			of peace on earth, to all goodwill.
			
		[335. Once When My Heart was Pssion Free. C.M.]
		
			Once when my heart was pasion free
			to learn of things divine,
			the soul of nature suddenly outpoured
			iself in mine.
			
			I held the secrets of the deep
			and of heavens above;
			I knew the harmonies of sleep,
			the mysteries of love.
			
			And for a moment's interval
			the earth, the sky, the sea - 
			my soul encompassed each and all,
			as they encompassed me
