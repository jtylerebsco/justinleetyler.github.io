<dc:description>Devoted to promoting equality of opportunity and treatment of women on the college campus, the American Association of University Women (AAUW), Oakland Branch was formed in 1938. The national organization began as the Association of Collegiate Alumnae (ACA) in Boston in 1882. In 1889 a Detroit Branch was founded the first in Michigan-followed in 1902 by the Ann Arbor-Ypsilanti Branch. In 1921 the ACA became the AAUW. Since its inception, the AAUW has been an advocate of open access to post-secondary education, non-discriminatory student financial aid, federal aid to higher education, and the elimination of sex bias on campus. AAUW established its fellowships program in 1888, which became the AAUW Educational Foundation in 1958. When the Oakland Branch was formed on March 21, 1938, a four-fold purpose was set up: 1) Offer members a do-it-yourself form of continuing education with work at the graduate level; 2) Become an informed group in the community and serve as a resource; 3) Identify social problems, explore them and work toward solutions; and 4) Work with the Association to open educational and professional opportunities.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Malcolm Bingay began his newspaper career as a teenager. He served as sports editor for the Detroit News from 1906-1910, and as city editor from 1910-1914. Mr. Bingay was promoted to managing editor in 1914 and was sent to manage the London, England bureau of the Detroit News in 1925. After returning to Detroit he joined the Detroit Free Press in 1930 as editorial director. As a columnist for the Detroit Free Press, he authored two daily features, "Good Morning" and "Iffy the Dopester". Mr. Bingay received an honorary Doctor of Letters degree from Wayne University in 1932, and Olivet College made him a Doctor of Laws in 1946. In his own profession of journalism, Mr. Bingay won the coveted Pulitzer Prize for a series of medical articles which were cited for their sharp insight and brilliant style. As a direct result of that honor, the Wayne County Medical Society named Mr. Bingay to the Detroit Medical Hall of Fame and conferred upon him an honorary membership. In April, 1945, Mr. Bingay was one of a group of twelve law makers and seventeen publishers and editors to see first-hand evidence of Nazi atrocities in Europe, visiting a number of concentration camps in German. Malcolm Bingay died in Detroit in August, 1953.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Helen Carolyn Bower was born in Michigan on January 7, 1896, to D. Herbert and Amelia Bower. She came from a newspaper family: her father owned and edited the Buchanan (Mich.) Record, and her grandfather, Daniel Bower, had owned a newspaper in Williamsport, Penn. before the Civil War. By 1910, the family was living in Detroit, Mich. After graduating from high school Bower got a job at the Detroit Free Press in 1914, covering women's clubs. She left the paper to attend the University of Michigan, but returned in 1916 to become Assistant Society Editor. Her father was killed in that same year in an automobile accident. Though Helen had announced her engagement in 1918 to U.S. Army Lieutenant Daniel W. Kent, son of Mr. and Mrs. Clarence D. Kent of Buchanan, they were never married. The 1920 Federal Census shows Daniel Kent, age 24, living in Buchanan with his parents, working as an office clerk. Helen was active in a number of organizations and served on the board of Women's Hospital, Women's City Club, Friends of the Detroit Public Library, and two sororities. She worked for the National War Work Council Overseas Service during World War I, and spent time in 1922 Japan and other Far East countries.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Frederick Bellinger, born in Rushville, Indiana, was the son of Reverend Martin Luther Jones and Annie Mae Battle Bellinger. Frederick fell in love with music, especially choral music, at the age of twelve. At that time he began singing lessons at the Detroit Institute of Musical Arts. He also studied with Josephine Hanell Love and Nellie Beatrice Hugher Ebersole. At Hutchins Intermediate (Junior High) he took part in memorable musical productions such as H. M. S. Captain Pinafore. He continued in his music and graduated from Cass Technical High School in Detroit, Michigan. Additional formal education includes a B. A. Degree in Elementary and Secondary Music Education from Philander Smith College, Little Rock Arkansas. While attending Philander Smith College, he traveled with the Philander Smith Collegiate Choir to different states promoting the college. His graduate work was done at Indiana State Teachers College, Terre Haute. Indiana and Michigan State University, Lansing Michigan. Frederick began his teaching career in Florida where he taught several years in Lake City. Later he returned to Pontiac, Michigan where he taught in the Pontiac Public Schools and founded his own choral organization, the Bell Chorale. The Bell Chorale was made up of people from the community and all walks of life. They performed, at times under the auspices of the Pontiac Parks and Recreation Department, performing at numerous community affairs held at schools and other occasions such as Ground breaking ceremonies, memorial services, special services for organizations such as the Urban League, sorority sponsored programs, and scholarship benefit programs in the Pontiac and Detroit areas. Gilbert Jackson was the accompanist for the Bell Chorale. During the 1960s and 1970s, Frederick was active with the Wayne State University Opera Workshop and Celeste Cole Opera Workshop appearing often as Tenor Soloist in the productions. In the 1970s he appeared as guest soloist with the Detroit Symphony. During this period as a member of the Kenneth Jewell Chorale Tenor section, Frederick was soloist and on occasion Assistant Director. The Kenneth Jewell Chorale performed with area orchestras including the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, the Dearborn Symphony Orchestra, Plymouth Symphony Orchestra, and choirs such as Interlochen Academy Choir, Rackham Symphony Choir and Cantata Academy. Kenneth Jewell Concerts were given throughout the Detroit area at churches, on college and university campuses, at conferences, festivals and an important participant of series such as Bach at Cranbrook and Music at Westminster Series. In 1970, Frederick, after teaching music in Pontiac Public Schools, began teaching at Cranbrook Schools, Bloomfield, Michigan where he taught for 30 years. An editorial by Josh Steinman and Emily Bate states that Mr. "B", as he was lovingly addressed on campus, was known to push students to excel, while having understanding and compassion for their needs outside of class, and me producing consistently remarkable ensembles. Frederick Bellinger joined Cantata Academy under Conductor, Arthur Stephan as a chorus member while singing with the Kenneth Jewell Chorale. In the mid 1960s he soon became Vocal Soloist and the Assistant Conductor. In the 1971-1972 season, he was appointed Music Director and Conductor of Cantata Academy. Under his direction Cantata Academy continued to grow in number and had done at least 12 European Concert tours. Programs ranging from classical and sacred to popular and secular. In 1991, celebrating the 30th Anniversary of Cantata Academy, Peter Beerwerth, the Consulate General of the Federal Republic of Germany wrote a congratulatory letter to Frederick and the Cantata Academy. Beerwerth noted over the years, through the German tours, Cantata developed contacts with a sizable number of German Choirs. Thereby, playing an active role in the cultural exchange between the two countries. Most of Cantata Academy concerts included a segment of Negro Spirituals. During Frederick's soloist period, he would often sing "This Little Light of Mine" during a concert at or near the end. He lived this song with great commitment, love and passion. Throughout his life Frederick was an avid supporter of public and private school musical activities, out-of-town choirs, local choir concerts, local and visiting artists, area churches, the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, the Detroit Opera House, and music associations to which he belonged. Prior to his passing on May 28, 2000 Frederick Bellinger was Conductor Emeritus of Cantata Academy, Choral Vocalist Instructor at Cranbrook schools, Bloomfield Hills Michigan, Choirmaster at Christ Church Dearborn, a member of the American Guild of Organists, the Association of Anglican Musicians, the Michigan School Vocal Association, and the Omega Psi Phi Faternity.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In 1886, George H. Hammond, a wealthy Detroit meat packer, opened what the Detroit Free Press boasted as "a huge enterprise...George H. Hammond &amp;amp; Co. will build in Detroit, the largest oleomargarine factory in the country." Born in Massachusetts around 1838, Hammond became the builder of Detroit's first skyscraper, the Hammond Building. In 1870, Hammond built the first successful refrigerated boxcar, packing it with ice from the Detroit River and sending a shipment of beef to Boston. By 1885, the Hammond Standish &amp;amp; Company meat-packing house was using 800 refrigerated boxcars and were delivering three carloads of meat a week to the Atlantic seaboard. Hammond married Ellen Barry and they had eight children. Among those who went into the family business were sons George, Charles and Edward, and daughter Florence. Florence married Edward A. Skae, who acted as secretary-treasurer of the Hammond Building Co. In 1920, Hammond Standish &amp;amp; Company was listed in the Detroit City Directory as a Beef and Pork Packing House. Charles F. Hammond was president and treasurer. At the same time, Edward Hammond was president of the Hammond Building Company, with his sister Florence working as secretary and treasurer. Historian W. Hawkins Ferry, in The Buildings of Detroit, describes Detroit's pride when the Hammond Building was completed: "In 1890 Detroit was astir with excitement over the completion of its first skyscraper, the Hammond Building, which stood on the southeast corner of Fort and Griswold Streets. To celebrate the opening a tightrope walker was hired to walk from the roof of the ten story structure to the tower of the City Hall across Fort Street..." Though George H. Hammond died before his namesake building was erected, a Chicago architect, Harry W.J. Edbrooke, was able to persuade Mrs. Hammond to hire him to create the skyscraper. In 1956 the Hammond Building was torn down to make room for the new National Bank of Detroit.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Joseph L. Hudson was born October 17, 1846 in Newcastle-on-Tyne, England. In 1855 he came with his mother and five other children to Hamilton, Ontario where his father had gone in 1853. In 1860 the family moved to Grand Rapids. In 1861 Joseph began working for C. R. Mabley who ran a clothing store in Pontiac. Richard Hudson, Joseph's father, bought out Mabley and induced Joe to take over management of the store in 1865. This business, R. Hudson &amp;amp; Son, prospered until 1873 when the panic in that year wrecked the clothing store financially and led it into bankruptcy in 1876. J. L. then came to Detroit and worked again for Mabley until 1881 when he opened his own store. Joseph L. Hudson was involved in many civic and business activities during his years in Detroit. He was on the boards of two banks, President of Harper Hospital, and Detroit's first lighting commissioner. J. L. Hudson died July 5, 1912 while traveling in England, he was still unmarried.

<dc:description>James F. Joy was born in Durham, New Hampshire in December 1810. He was a teacher in a country school before entering Harvard Law School. Joy was an instructor of Latin at Dartmouth College. He came to Detroit in 1836 and was admitted to the Michigan Bar one year later. For many years, beginning in 1837, he was a law partner of George F. Porter, in the firm Joy &amp;amp; Porter. Joy presently became involved in banking matters, and, in about the 1840s, in railroad activities, which were to dominate his career until its end. He developed a marked talent for financial and executive enterprises and became one of the great railroad builders of his century. The papers shed light upon his connections with scores of railroads and with the multifarious legal, real estate, monetary and industrial aspects of their promotion and upon political activities designed to promote or influence railroad construction and consolidation. Joy bore a major role in pushing the Michigan Central Railroad west from Kalamazoo to Chicago, and he was associated more or less importantly with dozens of railroad promotions in both the United States and Canada. He served as counsel of the Michigan Central Railroad in 1846, becoming president of it in 1865. Before his retirement in 1877, Joy was active in building several other lines. He died in Detroit on September 24, 1896. The papers in this vast collection are chiefly legal and business, and there is comparatively little personal material. Joy was a pronounced anti-slavery man, and some of the earlier papers pertain to the Cassopolis fugitive slave case of the early 1850s.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This collection focuses primarily on William and Clara Knudsen and Clara and Robert VanderKloot and their family. It contains correspondence, speeches, newspaper clippings and photographs of both the Knudsen and VanderKloot families, as well as materials from Denmark.</dc:description>
<dc:description>William S. Knudsen was born in Copenhagen, Denmark on March 25, 1879, coming to America twenty years later. He met Clara Euler in Buffalo, New York. The daughter of Charles and Christina Euler, tailors from Germany, Clara had been born in New York around 1880. William and Clara were married on November 1, 1911 and had four children. Their oldest daughter, Clara "Tuttie" Knudsen, married Robert VanderKloot in 1936.William and Clara Knudsen had four children: Semon "Bunkie", Clara "Tuttie", Ella "Dottie", and Martha "Girlie". The family came to Detroit from New York in 1913, where Ella and Martha were born, and that year Mr. Knudsen became a naturalized U.S. citizen. They lived in Highland Park, with a summer home on Grosse Ile. The Knudsen's were very civic-minded. Mr. Knudsen was the honorary chairman of the Queen Alexandrine Unit of the American Red Cross. He was awarded the King Christian medal for his work by the Danish Red Cross in 1948, shortly before his death. A fund in Mrs. Knudsen's honor, the Clara Elizabeth Fund, was established at Flint's Hurley Hospital to teach new mothers how to care for themselves and their children. The Lutheran School for the Deaf in Detroit was dedicated to Mrs. Knudsen, and the Knudsen Home for Children in Denmark was named for Mr. Knudsen. He was also instrumental in building two of Detroit's Lutheran churches, Epiphany and Outer Drive Faith. Clara Euler Knudsen died in Detroit on April 17, 1950 at the age of 69, almost exactly two years after the death of her husband. The Knudsen's son Semon, nicknamed `Bunkie", worked for General Motors until 1968, when he quit to become president of Ford Motor Company. Unfortunately, he was fired just nineteen months later, to be succeeded by Lee Iacocca. After leaving Ford, Bunkie went into the manufacturing of motor homes in Farmington Hills. In 1971 he became chairman and CEO of White Motor Company, which made heavy trucks and farm equipment. He retired in 1980 and died in 1998 at the age of 85. Clara Knudsen was married to Robert VanderKloot on June 16, 1936. The son of Matthew and Elizabeth VanderKloot, Robert was born in Michigan in 1914. His father was the well-to-do owner of a Detroit photo engraving company. Robert served in the Air Corps during World War II, receiving a promotion from First Lieutenant to Captain before the war's end. He became president of VanderKloot Press, Inc., a book and commercial printing firm in Detroit. Clara "Tuttie" Knudsen VanderKloot was chairman of the International Travelers Market, a benefit for the Save the Children Federation, in 1959. She also served as a national sponsor of the organization. She died at age 87 on January 9, 2001. One of Bob and Tuttie's children was Karen VanderKloot DiChiera, who served for a time as a Detroit Public Library commissioner.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Charles H. Mahoney, Detroit attorney and businessman, was the first African-American to serve as U.S. delegate to the United Nations, having been appointed in 1954 by President Dwight Eisenhower. Born in Decatur, Michigan in 1886 to Barney and Viora Simpson Mahoney, Charles finished his early education at Decatur. He attended Olivet College, distinguishing himself as an orator and an athlete. He later attended Fisk University in Nashville, Tenn, before entering the University of Michigan Law School, where he received his law degree in 1911. Charles Mahoney entered the practice of law in Detroit in 1912, and during the Sweet Trial, he was associate council to Clarence Darrow. In 1928, he was a founder of the Great Lakes Insurance Company in Detroit, serving as President and Board member from 1928-1959. In 1918 he ran unsuccessfully for Detroit's first nine man council.

Correspondence and other papers are interfiled alphabetically, except where noted.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Milo M. Quaife was born in Nashua, Iowa on October 6, 1880, the son of Albert E. and Barbara S. (Hine) Quaife. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in 1908. Dr. Quaife taught at Lewis Institute in Chicago, Wayne University and the University of Detroit. He served as superintendent of the State Historical Society of Wisconsin from 1914 until 1920. He was editor and founder of Wisconsin Magazine of History to 1.922 and managing editor of Mississippi Valle, Historical Review, 1924-1930. The author of many books and articles, Quaife edited the Lakeside Classics Series, 1916-1959, and was editor of the American Lake Series. He married Letitia Goslin in 1908 and they had four children. When the Detroit Public Library opened its new building in 1921, the Burton Historical Collection moved into its specially-designed quarters. A history of the Detroit Public Library, Parnassus on Main Street, by Frank Woodford, describes the evolution of the department: "In order to share its treasures with scholars and the public generally, the Burton Historical Collection began issuing a series of publications. To do that, as well as to organize its materials, the position of editor of the collection was created in 1923. After surveying the field of eminent scholars to find a man for the position, Dr. Milo M. Quaife was appointed, effective April 1, 1924. Quaife was well known as a historian, archivist, writer and editor.. .An acknowledged authority on the Old Northwest, he began the publication of a series of pamphlets known as the "Burton Leaflets", which were monographs on some phase of local history based upon materials in the Burton Collection... In 1935 financial considerations forced suspension of publishing by the Burton Collection, and Quaife's status was changed from editor to secretary, a post he continued to hold until his retirement in 1947..." Dr. Milo Quaife died in a automobile accident on September 1, 1959.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The Rapid Transit Commission was first appointed by Mayor Couzens in November 1922 to make rapid transit studies. It was not officially established until September 1924 when the voters passed a Charter amendment establishing it. The Commission made five official proposals in the years 1926 through 1933 for subways. In 1933 the voters approved a subway system but no money was appropriated for the Commission or the subway in 1933. Nothing was done until 1944 when the City of Detroit Transportation Board was established. The Rapid Transit Commission was reactivated in 1948 but was deactivated in early 1950 after a rapid transit report was made and hearings end discussions on the report were held. The Commission was reactivated in July 1953 by Mayor Cobo. The Commission remained active until 1967 when the Southeastern Michigan Transit Authority was created by the legislature.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Born in Grodno, Poland on March 16, 1903, Louis Redstone (born Leon Rotenstein) left home at the age of seventeen to immigrate to Palestine. As a member of the Zionist Pioneer Youth Group, he spent three years planting trees and learning the construction trade. He came to Detroit in the 1920s, where his brother Sol was already living, and got a job as a bricklayer on Detroit's Buhl Building. Redstone enrolled in the University of Michigan School of Architecture, graduating in 1929. He worked for a time for Albert Kahn Associates, but returned to Palestine in 1933 where he opened his first architecture practice in Tel Aviv, designing apartments. In 1937 he returned to Detroit and formed his own company, Louis G. Redstone &amp;amp; Associates. Redstone later attended Cranbrook Academy of Art, where he graduated with an advanced degree in urban planning. He studied under the direction of noted Finnish architect Eliel Saarinen, for whom he named his youngest son. Redstone married Ruth Rosenbaum, a teacher and social worker from New York, in June 1939. They had two sons, Daniel and Eliel, both of whom received a degree in architecture from U of M. Daniel joined his father's firm; Eliel formed his own architectural firm in San Francisco. Louis Redstone died in Detroit on March 30, 2002, at the age of ninety-nine.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Presented,July 16,1934,by E.H.Sheldor of Muskegon,Mich. ,and Mrs. Edith Reid of Tuscon,Ariz. (grandchildren of J.P.Sheldon)</dc:description>
<dc:description>John P. Sheldon was born in Rhode Island in 1792, and, after service in the War of 1812, with A.G. Dauby, establishing in Rochester, New York that city's first newspapers, the Gazette. A year later, in 1817, he sold his interests to Dauby, and headed towards the Northwest. While awaiting passage in Buffalo, he met Ebenezer Reed; the two young men decided to pool their resources, and together they began a newspaper in Detroit. The first issue of the Detroit Gazette appeared on July 25, 1817, and it lasted until the spring of 1830 when their office was destroyed by fire. While in Detroit, Sheldon had been a trustee of the city, 1923; county commissioner, 1922-1925; and alderman, 1828. He was editor of the Detroit Free Press in 1831. In 1833 Sheldon headed further west when Secretary of War Lewis Cass appointed him assistant superintendent of the lead mines in the Sauk and Fox Purchase near Dubuque, Iowa. From 1834 to 1840 he served as registrar of the U.S. Land Office in Mineral Point, Wisconsin, and later as clerk in the Third Auditor's Office in Washington. John P. Sheldon died in Winfield, Illinois on July 19, 1871.</dc:description>

<dc:description>William O. Stoddard Jr. was the son of another William O. Stoddard who served as Abraham Lincoln's private secretary during the Civil War. Born in New York City, Mr. Stoddard Jr. moved to Detroit in 1923. He was a former president of the Pere Marquette Rod and Gun Club and elder in the Woodward Avenue Presbyterian Church. William O. Stoddard Jr. died in Detroit in January 1965. In 1955, Mr. Stoddard Jr. wrote a book about his father's experiences, and was one of the few persons invited to Washington when Lincoln's letters and private documents were unsealed. William Stoddard Sr., as a 25-year-old editor of the Central Illinois Gazette, was credited with being the first to suggest to Lincoln, then an Illinois country lawyer, to run for president. Lincoln took him to Washington after his election and, while Stoddard was known as third secretary, ranking behind John G. Nicolay and John Hay, he had an office directly across the hall from Lincoln's and handled most of his confidential errands. Besides the book on his father's experiences, Mr. Stoddard Jr. also wrote five books for boys, but his vocation was the automobile industry. He invented a coated textile used in auto roofs during the early days of the industry, and in later years sold textiles for car interiors.</dc:description>

<dc:description>George Washington Trendle was born July 4, 1889 in Norwalk, Ohio. The family moved to Detroit in 1891. Trendle studied law at Detroit College of Law, graduating in 1908. In 1915, Trendle worked as attorney and general manager for Kunsky Enterprises, a theater management company. Three years later Trendle became part owner of the Madison Theater with John Kunsky (who later changed his name to King). By the 1920s, Trendle was a partner in what was now called the King-Trendle Company. They held exclusive rights to all the motion picture theaters in Michigan. Trendle had full charge of the corporation, which owned seventeen theaters in the Detroit area. The late 1920s-'30s saw the purchase of radio station WGHP. Trendle arranged with the U.S. Navy to get permission to use the call letters "WXYZ" so that he could add a catchy slogan: "The last thing in radio". (See Box 48:14) H. Allen Campbell, who started as sales manager and later partner of WXYZ, became a partner in the Trendle Campbell Corporation. Raymond Meurer, a lawyer, was hired to handle contracts and eventually the company became known as Trendle-Campbell-Meurer. The companies were responsible for producing a number of radio programs, the most well-known being "The Lone Ranger", "The Green Hornet" and "Sgt. Preston of the Yukon", all created by Trendle. Other shows included "Bob Barclay, American Agent" and "Ned Jordan, Secret Agent", among others. The three former shows, however, proved the most popular and made the transition to television.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In 1921 the University of Detroit, under the direction of Father John McNichols, selected land at Livernois and Six Mile Road as the site of the expanded University of Detroit campus. Properties in the area were bought by developers, subdivided into tracts and lots and put up for sale to the general public. Originally, the University District was part of the largest tract in the area. The District was known then and is still referred to by some as "The Golf Club District." Most of the homes in the area were built during the years from 1925-30 and 1937-41. During these years construction technology was highly developed and labor and material costs were relatively low. In 1991, the University District remains one of the city's more stable communities. It is often cited as a model for racially balanced neighborhoods. The community has an abundance of attorneys, physicians, educators, homemakers, city officials, and executives living within the 50 square block area. The University District Community Association Papers consist of nine boxes and one large manuscript folder. The Papers contain minutes, membership lists, correspondence, newsletters, records on a variety of subjects of neighborhood concern, newspaper clippings, maps, and photographs.

<dc:description>Arthur Webster was an attorney and judge of the Wayne County Circuit Court from 1919-1957. He was born on a farm near Montrose, Iowa on April 15, 1871, the son of George and Cornelia M. (Allen) Webster. Webster attended public schools in southwestern Missouri before entering the University of Michigan for the study of law. He received his degree in 1892, and entered upon his professional career in Detroit, in the office of Corliss Leete &amp;amp; Andrus. For five years he was assistant in the office of the corporation counsel and he subsequently engaged in private practice for a time. He then entered the office of the prosecuting attorney as assistant, and remained in that position for four years. After that position, Webster formed a partnership with Robert M. Chamberlain and Edwin Denby (who later became Secretary of the Navy under President Warren G. Harding), in the firm of Chamberlain, May, Denby &amp;amp; Webster. This partner-ship was continued for eleven years, at the end of which time Webster was nominated for the circuit bench and was elected to the office, taking his seat on January 1, 1919, for a term of five years. On April 30, 1910, Arthur Webster married Laura Belle Russell of Toledo, Ohio, daughter of Charles Russell. They had two children. Judge Webster was a member of many legal associations, as well as the Detroit Boat Club, Detroit Athletic Club and Detroit Tennis Club. He was known as a man of `high and honorable principles and his work had won recognition from his professional colleagues and the public at large.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The Jeffersonian apartment building, located on East Jefferson Avenue, was conceived and designed as a luxury apartment building on the waterfront in downtown Detroit, Michigan. Designed by the architectural firm of Giffels and Rossetti, construction started in 1962 and the first apartments were leased in 1965. The building was the subject of a lawsuit brought by the FHA against the developer, Arthur Fleischman (1895-1985), a prominent local businessman. Construction setbacks, and the cash flow problems they created, caused the FHA to attempt to force a foreclosure of the property.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Edward snow was born in Ohio in 1820. He graduated with honors from Grand River Institute in 1842, fully supporting himself while doing so. Initially he took an interest in surveying, but an experience caring for a sick friend turned his attention toward medicine. He received his medical degree from western Reserve College in Cleveland in 1847. He then briefly practiced in Plymouth, Michigan before settling in Dearborn in 1849. He became Acting Assistant surgeon at the Detroit Arsenal there, where he served for a year. In 1852 he was reinstated by Jefferson Davis, then secretary of war, and served until the closure of the Arsenal in the mid-1870's. During the Civil war he cared for families of volunteers without charge. Dr. Snow was a founding member of the first and second Wayne County Medical societies, the first Detroit Medical society, and the Michigan Medical Society, as well as a member of the American Medical Association. He was a careful businessman and managed to amass a large fortune. Dr. Snow died of apoplexy in 1892.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Organized in 1895, the Woman's Research Club of Detroit became affiliated with the General Federation of Women's Clubs three years later. Meetings were held from October to May each year: originally held once a week, by the 1950s they were held twice a month.The General Federation of Women's Clubs (GFWC) is an international women's organization dedicated to community improvement by enhancing the lives of others through volunteer service. In 1898, the year the Woman's Research Club of Detroit became federated, the GFWC began a program to eliminate child labor in the United States. By 1901, the U.S. Congress chartered the GFWC and designated that the Federation be headquartered in Washington DC, where it remains to this day.On the afternoon of February 25, 1895, an adjunct society of the Woman's Research Club was organized to meet on Monday afternoons. It was known as the "Trianon", and its purpose was a reading circle for a course of study in French history, "a subject of interest to all." Records of the Trianon may be found in Box 1:4.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Loosely organized as an auxiliary of the Detroit Engineering Society by the wives of its officers and members in 1928, the Society of Engineers' Wives began officially in 1930 as the Women's Auxiliary to the Detroit Engineering Society (DES). Members were wives of DES members, corporate executives and prominent engineers in the Detroit area. Many husbands were members of the Wayne University faculty. At first, the auxiliary helped DES mainly by serving as hostesses for visiting engineering groups. In 1935, the DES became the Engineering Society of Detroit (ESD), and they moved into the Rackham Memorial Building as their headquarters. At the same time, the ladies' auxiliary changed their name to Society of Engineers' Wives (SEW). SEW played a big part in the social life of ESD, decorating the new headquarters, donating a piano, holding fund raisers, sponsoring a scholarship fund, and continuing to serve as hostesses to wives accompanying their husbands to engineering conferences. During the World War 11 years, SEW was heavily involved in Bonds for Victory, volunteer service for the Red Cross, and other volunteer war work. By the 1970s, with membership dropping, SEW decided to open membership to wives of graduate and qualified engineers in the Detroit Metropolitan area. By 1999, however, the club was disbanded. The last meeting was held in September 1999 at the Grosse Pointe Yacht Club (see Scrapbooks, Volume 13).</dc:description>

<dc:description>Moral Re-Armament was a movement that grew out of a program created at Oxford University by Dr. Frank Buchman in 1921. Supported by students and senior members of the University, leadership developed in the various colleges. As the influence of the work spread throughout Britain, it was assigned the name Oxford Group by the British Government. The Oxford Group was "a Christian revolution... [whose] aim [was] a new social order under the dictatorship of the Spirit of God..." Moral Re-Armament grew out of these origins to increase "moral and spiritual standards in men and nations as the only hope for a democratic world." The purpose of Moral Re-Armament was to arouse in the democracies a thinking and living adequate to the threatened impact of total war.A finding aid is available to assist researchers.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In a city which as, until recently, been careless of preserving it's past, Fort Street Presbyterian Church stands as a monument to the small group that formed it as the Second Presbyterian Church and to the succeeding congregations that carried on to the present day. The stately homes that once surrounded their edifice have given way to a more commercial aspect, but the city in which many members took a leading part is now growing appreciative of its historic institutions. In the year 1849 the pioneer period in Michigan was drawing to a close. Outlying counties were filling up fast, and the more adventurous were leaving for the gold and fields of California. But those with a nose for business were finding plenty of action at this hub of the Great Lakes. The next several decades which saw the growth of the church, saw also the growth of the fortunes of many of its members. Among them were James P. Joy whose name is linked with railroads; Eber Brock Ward, "Detroit's first millionaire" whose fleet of boats brought iron ore from the upper peninsula to be smelted in Detroit's first iron foundry. Sylvester Larned, Shubael Conat, Frederick H. Buhl and Zachariah Chandler were just a few of the members whose names figured prominently in the city's progress. Among the first organizers of the church were Samuel Zug, remembered best as the owner of Zug Island, and Detroit's Postmaster, Thomas Rowland and his wife Catherine Mason Rowland, sister to Michigan's first governor. Perhaps because of these links with the past and the close involvement of its members with the life of the city, the Fort Street congregation has kept an awareness of its unique contribution, and has preserved many of the records of its activity and growth. A very small but noteworthy group of these mementos are six little notebooks covered in brown leather, containing records of the First Protestant Society, 1842-1845, 1953. They record the receipts for pew assessments, each trustee being responsible for collecting for a certain number of pews. The First Protestant Society in Detroit was the forerunner of the First Presbyterian Church. The Second Presbyterian Church as a splinter group from which the present Fort Street Presbyterian Church was formed. From these first small notebooks to the bulky volumes of later years, the growth of the institution can be traced through the increase of complexity and it's finances.But more than the business side (which in Presbyterian churches is the work of the trustees) was involved in growth. The work of the Session (composed of Elders, Deacons and the Minister) increased with the addition of new members. Minute books covering the years 1849 to 1901 attest to their activities. Church manuals succeeded by Yearbooks and later by Directories are valuable additions to the records of he church. It is to be hoped that others will turn up to fill the gaps.The records of an institution such as this show how closely it was bound up with the lives of its members. The heartbreaking fires in 1876 and 1914, which, in both cases, followed soon after the building had been reconditioned and redecorated, seemed only to increase the determination of the parish to survive. The financial problems were always resolved by generous acts by members at both ends of the financial scale. Church anniversaries were duly celebrated with appropriate ceremonies and publications at every twenty-fifth year and many of the years between. Many able pastors contributed to the well being of the church, not the least of those being the ones of recent years who have encouraged the congregation to stand fast as the world shifted about them. While other churches fled to the suburbs, Fort Street Presbyterian Church remained, "a spiritual beacon in the heart of Detroit." As Dr. Edward H. Pence foretold in a letter to his flock in 1915, in fifty years the location has grown in value and has now become part of the revitalization of the area. It now stands as a historical remnant of old Detroit the edification of tourists and convention goers and as a church center for those who make their home in downtown apartments.The vitality of the church is well illustrated by the organizations formed within it. Although early records of the Bible School are missing, there is a complete set of records from 1876-1921. The records of the Women's Association are many, although incomplete, and several other organizations are represented. The church camp in Oxford Township, Oakland County, was acquired in 1920 and is represented by two boxes of memorabilia. Church publications form an important part of its records as do the many pictures and blueprints preserved with them. Four hundred and seven glass slides and a box of stereoptican are included in the collection.Miss Sarah Grindley, whose family was for many years active in church affairs, collected old photographs, records, and information into a history which was published at the time of its one hundredth anniversary. She deserves much credit for her labors and her writings are a part of the church archives. Mr. Joseph Grindley, her brother, might properly be called the first Curator of the Fort Street Presbyterian Church Archives. They were kept in wooden cabinets in the church basement. Mr. Grindley died in 1961. A historical committee was formed which included William M. Watson, Chairman, Acrchibald S. Watson, W.E.C. Huthwaite and Dr. Harvey Merker. The Messrs. Watson went over the volumes and made notes which were attached to the volumes. They also assigned numbers to them in chronological order. In June 1964 the records were transferred to the Burton Historical Collection.It was found necessary to reorganize the Collection into sections of material representing the different groups that ran the business of the church and its organizations. For this reason a strict chronological sequence was not possible. For the sociologist, the historian as well as those interested preeminently in church history, the material listed on the following pages should prove increasingly valuable in the years to come. For the biographer of many of Detroit's leading citizens or for the student of Detroit's history the records of this church serve to round out many of the other material already in the Burton Historical Collection.</dc:description>

<dc:description>03201</dc:description>
<dc:description>The Hospital Association of the Teachers of the Public Schools of Detroit was conceived at a principals meeting held on October 1, 1901. Superintendent W. C. Martindale, briefly outlined a plan by which it would be possible for the teachers of the public schools of Detroit to endow rooms in one or more of the city hospitals. Principal actions later authorized Mr. Martindale to appoint a committee of 19 whose Chairman was Mr. Charles F. Adams. The Association was officially founded on March 3, 1902. Its objective was to provide for the relief of distressed teachers, the visitation of the sick, the burial of the dead, and especially to endow, own and control beds or rooms in hospitals for the use of the sick and disabled teachers, to invest and manage such funds. The Hospital Association of the Teachers of the Public Schools of Detroit changed its name to Detroit Teachers Hospital Association in 1941. The association was scheduled to dissolve on September 30, 1973 due to the lack of interest in the organization because of other board insurance plans that apparently were adequate for most teachers at that time, therefore, the last year that the association functioned was 1973. However, the dissolution of the association required more time than expected because the school-strike in the fall of 1973 delayed the disbursement of checks to members prorated on the number of years of membership from the remaining funds. By the fall of 1974 most members had received their checks; however, some checks were misplaced and lost and had to be duplicated taking more time and causing more expenses. Remaining funds after all benefit claims, fees, and expenses were paid were donated to the Wayne State University Medical School Long Term Loan Fund. The last meeting presenting the treasurer's final report was on May 28, 1975.</dc:description>

<dc:description>On a national level, the Free Sons of Israel were founded in New York City on January 18, 1848. The immediate purpose in its organization by nine Jewish men was to remove from the Charter of the city of New York restrictions against the consecration of grounds for burial purposes in order to allow for a Jewish cemetery. Its early motto was "Friendship, Love and Truth." Provisions were soon made for sick benefits and burial ground privileges. Death benefits were established in 1871. In 1920, it was decided to admit non participating or "social" members in order to permit more youth to participate. Through the years, it has supported hospitals, nursing homes, charities, etc. In Detroit, Montefiore Lodge No. 12 was established on Dec. 4, 1864 and was open only to Jews. Its purpose, as revealed in its original Article #3 was "to relieve the members in case of sickness and to aid and assist the widows and orphans of the Lodge and in case of decease of a member of the Lodge or any of his family.., to give them decent burial upon the burying grounds of the corporation. Shortly after its founding, the Lodge purchased burial ground at Mack Road and Mt. Elliott in Hamtramck. (blue index cards)</dc:description>

<dc:description>Goodwill Industries was founded by Boston, Massachusetts philanthropist Henry Morgan in 1905 as the Morgan Memorial Cooperative Industries and Store, Inc. After several name changes, the organization was absorbed by the Board of Home Missions of the Methodist Episcopal Church in Philadelphia and became the Bureau of Goodwill Industries. In 1934, it became the National Association for Goodwill Industries and operated under that name for 48 years. In 1971, Goodwill Industries merged with the League for Handicapped Services and now goes by the official name of Goodwill Industries-League for the Handicapped Services. The organization's mission is to help the plight of the urban poor and the handicapped of America. It collects old clothes, furniture, and appliances. They hire handicapped workers to clean and repair the equipment and then sell it to the poor in their Goodwill stores. It's motto is "not a charity, but a chance." In 1907, the first Women's Auxiliary was founded to support Henry Morgan's work in Boston. In 1930, the National Women's Auxiliary to Goodwill Industries was organized. The women's auxiliaries or associations (as they were known) worked to raise money for Goodwill Industries and promote the organization through community events such as luncheons, teas, dinner and other entertainment. The associations worked closely with the Protestant churches in their communities. A Junior Auxiliary group was created for younger women and also worked to support both organizations. The Detroit chapter of Goodwill Industries began in 1921 and was officially chartered by the national association in 1926. It was still in existence as of July 1995. The Women's Association of Goodwill Industries in Detroit was organized in 1931. Mrs. John H. Stalker was the first chapter president and there were 116 members. They worked to support Goodwill Industries in Detroit by promoting Goodwill within the Protestant Community, by collecting material for the Goodwill Stores, and by providing emergency food and medical supplies. The Women's Association in Detroit was active until 1989. Kathryn G. Leonard was the last association president. The papers of the Women's Association of Goodwill Industries in Detroit reflect their work to support the charitable works of the Detroit Goodwill Industries and to a lesser extent, Goodwill Industries of America.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This collection consists mainly of photographs of the Mantel family. Also included are photos of the Hamper, Stair and Bowes families. The earliest items in the collection are undated photographs, probably dating in the late 1800's, but the earliest dated items are photographs of Genevieve Hamper in 1911.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Genevieve Hamper was born on September 8, 1888, the daughter of Henry and Emma Hamper. Mr. Hamper worked as sales manager for the Globe Tobacco Co. in Detroit. Originally from Greenville, Michigan, the family came to Detroit around 1907. Genevieve soon afterward took up the study of dramatic art and voice culture. Around 1910, at the height of his fame, Shakespearean actor Robert B. Mantel] came to Detroit with his touring acting company. Miss Hamper joined the troupe and the two of them were married two years later, on January 16, 1912 while on tour in Pueblo, Colorado. A Detroit Times newspaper article of January 17, 1912 wrote that Miss Hamper "...was praised for her work in `King Lear', as Cordelia, Jessica in 'The Merchant of Venice', and Marie in 'Louis XI'." The marriage to Miss Hamper was Mr. Mantell's fourth. The Times recounted the previous marriages: "Mr. Mantell's third wife, who was Marie Booth Russell, died at Atlantic Highlands, on Oct. 31 last. She was Mantell's leading lady for several years, before the marriage. Mantell married Mrs. Charlotte Huhn in Chicago, in 1896. She had been his leading lady. Mr. Mantell's first wife secured a divorce from him, naming Mrs. Huhn, who was the wife of a theatrical manager, as correspondent. His first wife was Marie Sheldon." Robert Bruce Mantell was born on February 7, 1854 in Scotland. His earliest Broadway credits were with his own company in December 1904. He and his company appeared on Broadway until 1918. From 1915-1923 he and his wife Genevieve appeared together in seven silent movies. Robert Mantell died at age 74, in 1928, in Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey. His obituary touted him as an "eminent tragedian". In 1931, Mrs. Mantell found herself in financial straits, and had to sell her husband's elaborate stage costumes to make some money. She was attempting a return to the stage with her son, Robert Jr., when real-life tragedy struck. Robert Jr., who had tried to make a go of it as an actor and had appeared in two silent films in 1915 and 1917, died at age twenty-one of suicide, in Hollywood, in 1933. Genevieve Hamper Mantel] died on February 13, 1971 in New York. Genevieve's brother, Charles, and his wife Winnetta had three children, including Kathleen. Kathleen Hamper, Genevieve's niece, married Edward Douglas (E.D.) Stair Jr., son of the newspaper publisher. They had three children, Susan, Nancy and E.D. III. After E.D.'s death, Kathleen married Jack Bowes in 1951.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In 1904 John Welch gave his daughter Maree Fegles Welch a school copybook as a gift for her eleventh birthday to use as a diary. The diaries from 1904 to 1914 consist primarily of copybooks and, in a number of cases, just scraps of paper. The records from 1917 to 1929 were primarily in form of letters from Maree to her daughter, Betty. Maree began keeping a bound diary in 1930, and the numbering of the diaries was discontinued. From 1930 until 1941 her diary served primarily as an appointment book and a record of their supper menus. In 1942 the entries began to be a record of her daily activities and her thoughts about them. Bound diaries were used from 1930 until 1958.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This collection deals with all aspects of the Detroit Zoo, including operating procedures, training programs, purchases of animals, zoo construction, landscaping and maintenance.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The first zoological park in Detroit was established in the early 1880s, and was the result of a small traveling circus that went bankrupt. The citizens of the City of Detroit took up a collection to assist in housing and feeding the abandoned creatures, and the Detroit Zoological Gardens, located on the site that would later become Tiger Stadium, was opened to the public on September 5, 1883. The park suffered from financial problems, however, and by July 1884 was closed. It was reported that the public took many of the animals home with them; the few remaining animals were turned over to the City of Detroit and the Belle Isle Zoo was established to house them. By 1901, the Belle Isle Zoo undertook a serious building program, with the Aquarium, Deer Shelter, Bear Dens and other exhibits erected. The Belle Isle Aquarium, the most ambitious of the exhibits, was opened to the public on August 18, 1904. The Detroit Zoological Society was formed in July 1911 by three prominent Detroiters; over the next few years, more men joined the group, but it took over a decade before the establishment of a Zoological Park Commission. In 1916, one hundred acres of the Hendrie Farm was purchased by the Society, located between Ten and Eleven Mile Roads, west of Woodward, in Royal Oak. Mayor James Couzens encouraged voters to accept the gift of the property by the Society, with the added incentive that an anonymous friend would agree to give the City an additional 160 acres of land adjoining the property. The gift was finally accepted in April of 1923, and a year later Mayor John C. Lodge established the Detroit Zoological Commission. Of the four men appointed to the CommissiOn, noted attorney Horace H. Rackham had been the donor of the additional acreage, which resulted in the Rackham Golf Course, next to the Detroit Zoo. Others on the Commission were attorney Henry Ledyard, Walter 0. Briggs, industrialist, and James S. Holden, a real estate tycoon who was to remain involved in the Zoo's operation for the next forty-three years (see Box 5:1). Under these men, the Detroit Zoo expanded its exhibits and additional structures such as the elegant Bird House, the rugged Bear Dens, and deliberately un-landscaped Cloverleaf Lake. The Detroit Zoo was the first modern zoo to feature bar-less exhibits throughout the grounds. Opening day for the Detroit Zoological Park in Royal Oak was August 1, 1928; over four thousand persons visited the Zoo in the first hour. Originally run by the Parks and Recreation Department, in 1941 the operation of the Belle Isle Zoo and Aquarium was transferred to the Zoological Park Commission. making it ancillary to the Detroit Zoological Park. This collection provides a fascinating behind-the-scenes look at a major metropolitan zoo. It deals with all aspects of the Detroit Zoo, including operating procedures, training programs, purchases of animals, zoo construction, landscaping and maintenance. For example, Tree Moving was a major project in the 1930s, as a Work Progress Administration (WPA) project. Thousands of trees from farms throughout the metropolitan area were moved and planted in Royal Oak to provide a park atmosphere for the new zoo (Box 11-12). Materials are arranged alphabetically by subject.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Papers included relate to Detroit's Department of Street Railways and the U.S. Department of labor papers include industry reports, transcripts of DSR arbitration proceedings, union contracts and bulletins.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Jack Schramm worked as superintendent of payroll with the Detroit Department of Street Railways (DSR) before his retirement. In 1976 he teamed up with Bill Henning, a professor at Macomb County Community College, and the two of them put together their first book, Detroit: Its Trolleys and Interurbans. This was followed two years later by Detroit's Street Railways, Volume 1. 863-1922. Photograph proofs from this volume are included in this collection (Box 1: 1-4). In 1980 Schramm and Henning, along with Thomas J. Dworman, came out with Volume 11, 1922-1956. These books were published as Bulletin 117 (Volume I) and Bulletin 120 (Volume II), of the Central Electric Railfans' Association. A third publication, When Eastern Michigan Rode the Rails, written with Richard R. Andrews, was published by Interurban Press of Glendale, California in 1984. Schramm and Henning also created the Michigan Transit Museum at the former railroad depot in Mt. Clemens. It displays a number of elevated and interurban cars, along with memorabilia from the days when rails were the primary form of transportation.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The Repatriados Oral History Committee, chaired by Elena Herrada, was organized in 1997 to gather information and histories on the Detroit Mexican community, namely the stories of those who suffered the fate of repatriation. The committee, comprised of descendants or relatives of repatriados, met with family members and elders of the Mexican community to document the history of repatriation in Detroit during the years of 1929 through 1939. In November of 2000, the committee received a grant from Detroit 300 in celebration of Detroit's 300`h birthday. The grant permitted the committee to finish their research and oral histories, and to subsequently create the documentary, Los Repatriados: Exiles from the Promised Land. The documentary was first presented at Ste Anne's Church, the preeminent church in Detroit's Mexican Community, in June of 2001. A second showing of the documentary coupled with a panel discussion occurred at the Detroit Institute of Arts in October of the same year. Subsequent screenings and lectures followed, including a program in San Luis Potosi, Mexico in June of 2004.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Jamison Handy--better known as "Jam"--was born in Philadelphia in 1886. The youngest of seven children, he was the son of Sarah Matthews and Major Moses P. Handy. His father was a newspaper editor for various publications including the Chicago Times-Herald, and his mother was also a writer, with her fiction and verse published in numerous magazines, among them Godey's Book. As a boy, young Handy became a strong swimmer, winning prizes at the local YMCA. He was so successful, in fact, that in 1904 he became a member of the U.S. Olympic Swim Team. Twenty years later he would again participate in the Olympic games, winning him a place in "Ripley's Believe It or Not". After attending the University of Michigan, Handy followed in his father's footsteps in becoming a newspaperman. He worked on the Chicago Tribune before forming an educational advertising agency with Herbert Kaufman. In 1916, Handy joined with James Keeley to form the Keeley-Handy Syndicate, a motion picture production company, which eventually included the Bray Studios of New York. Newspapers Film Corporation was the successor to the Keeley-Handy Syndicate, with Jam Handy acting as general manager. Jam Handy married Helen Hoag Rogers and had five children. Mrs. Handy died in 1973. Jam Handy died in 1983, having lived a long, active life. He swan regularly well into his nineties. This collection includes personal and company correspondence, photographs, memorabilia and newspaper clippings of this noteworthy man.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The Knights of the Maccabees was organized in 1878 as a beneficiary society. The name came from the ancient Maccabees who were followers of Judas Maccabeus. The "History of the Maccabees" explains, " They were not of any particular tribe, but were Jews who feared not to face death in defense of their belief in the God of their fathers. The exact meaning of the name 'Maccabeus' is veiled in obscurity, but. ..it was deemed to be an appropriate term to describe. ..a man of indomitable zeal and iron nerve... ". The Modern Maccaabees began in London, Ontario in 1878. Two years later meetings were held in Port Huron, Michigan and Buffalo, New York. Other "Great Camps" soon began in several states around the country and all provinces of Canada. The organization started out to care for the widows and orphans of its members. Originally, no medical examinations were required, and men, without regard to their age, family record, or physical condition, were admitted as endowment members. Each state or province had its "Great Camp", with divisions in cities known as "Supreme Tents".</dc:description>

<dc:description>In 1873, two German-Americans, August Ekhardt and Herman Becker, formed a partnership to enter the brewing business in Detroit, first located at 244 Russell St. In 1891, it merged with City Brewing Company, operated by Federick Fulda and August Kayser, and built a new brewery at Orleans and Winder St. The brewery dismantled in 1918 with national prohibition, but revived on May 1, 1933 with the repeal of prohibition, and built a new brewery in 1935 at the same site as the old plant at Riopelle and Winder. LeRoy Payne became company president in 1938. In 1952, Ekhardt and Becker absorbed Schmidt Brewery, and was itself acquired in 1962 by Pfeiffer as part of the newly formed Associated Brewing Company.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The Fred Sanders Papers include family and business papers of the 111-year-old ice cream and candy manufacturing company, headquartered in Highland Park, Mich.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The Son of a German baker, Frederick Schmidt was born in Germany in 1848. The family emigrated to the United States a year later, but as a young man Frederick returned to his homeland to learn more about baking as a business. Coming back to America, Schmidt--later called Sanders--opened bakery shops first in Philadelphia and then in Chicago. He came to Detroit only after his store was burned down in the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. Frederick Sanders opened the "Sanders Pavilion", a candy and ice cream shop, at the corner of Woodward Avenue and State Street in downtown Detroit in 1875. He later moved the store closer to the river, on Woodward near Michigan Avenue, and the company became a phenomenal success. By the turn of the century, Sanders opened his "Palace of Sweets" and it remained at the same location on Woodward for the next eighty-five years. By the mid-twentieth century, there were nearly two dozen Sanders stores serving fountain treats along with soups and sandwiches in Detroit and nearby suburbs. The Detroit Free Press reported, "In 1962, when John Sanders, great-grandson of the founder, took over the company from his father, Sanders had 111 stores and more than $20 million a year in sales." But the real world eventually caught up with the family-owned company, and the 1970s and '809 saw any ups.-,and downs with the struggling firm. "Trouble began in the mid-1970s," the Detroit Free Press reported, "as Sanders faced increasing competition from local rivals such as Awrey Bakeries and from outsiders such as Godiva Chocolates and Entenmann's, the Long Island baked goods company." Despite hiring outside management for the first time in its one hundred year history, by the early 1980s the floundering company, unable to compete with "slipping sales, rising costs and an aging plant", declared bankruptcy. In 1989 the company was taken over by Country Home Bakery, but the name and recipes were retained. At the time the collection ends, in 1989, there were just a handful of Sanders stores still operating in the Detroit area. The collection provides a bittersweet look at a nostalgic era in Detroit's past.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The Fred Sanders Company, which started in Detroit in 1875, was a popular manufacturer of ice cream and candy for over one hundred years.

<dc:description>Born in Lodz, Poland, she emigrated to Detroit, about 1913, after her father, Edward Zielinski, a Polish actor, had settled here and started Teatr Rozmaitosci (the Variety Theatre). In 1916, she married Antoni Hahrowski. Two sons were born of this union: Julius, in 1917; and Witold (Victor) in 1920. The marriage was dissolved in 1934.Her affiliation with the Polish stage was less prominent than her father's role; it became a vehicle for her students in her plays. She appeared rarely on the stage and then as a kindly grandmother. She is noted for establishing schools for the completion or perfection of the Polish language, history and culture. She stressed Polish awareness among her students, when the trend opposed any ethnic identity. For forty-three years she conducted her Saturday and evening classes, from elementary to intermediate levels, and summer caps where students arrived from all over Michigan. She taught in various fraternal lodges, schools and libraries in Detroit, and also in Wyandotte, Warren, Flint, Saginaw and Jackson with little financial support. Her purpose was single-minded, and no hardship deterred her from her goal. She died on August 28, 1983. (from B.M.) (blue index cards)</dc:description>

<dc:description>Andrew Marshall "Buddy" Anthos was born in Detroit on February 19, 1935. Sadly, he died just four days after his 72nd birthday, in 2007, the tragic result of a hate-crime attack in downtown Detroit. During his lifetime, Mr. Anthos enjoyed many hobbies, including collecting materials from the movies Somewhere in Time and Titanic. His main focus, however, was a dream of having the Michigan Capitol Dome in Lansing displayed with red, white and blue lights at least once a year. To this end, he devoted countless hours campaigning for his pet project. Mr. Anthos wrote hundreds of letters to prominent people around the world, seeking endorsements for his proposal. Of these correspondents, many responded, and this collection contains autographed letters of actors, politicians, university presidents, media personalities and authors from all over the country. Though he had numerous supporters, and received thousands of signatures encouraging his project, Mr. Anthos never lived to see his dream realized. In his obituary, Detroit Free Press reporter Desiree Cooper lauded Andrew Anthos as an "unlikely champion..." who deserved to have the capitol dome lit up "...to honor what Anthos in his death, has come to symbolize: the patriotic ideals of peace, inclusion and tolerance."</dc:description>

<dc:description>The Tuesday Musicale of Detroit was founded in 1885 by twelve women who wanted to promote good music in the city. The Tuesday Musicale presents ten Tuesday morning concerts each season, a Student League concert, a Christmas concert, an Annual Artist Concert, a President's Tea, and an Associate Members Tea. The Tuesday Musicale offers music scholarships at the University of Michigan, Wayne State University, Oakland University, and the Detroit Community Music School. Scholarships are also given to the Tuesday Musicale's student group known as the Student League. Since 1885 the Tuesday Musicale of Detroit has enabled opportunities for the musically talented in the Detroit area to become better known. Many outstanding artists, both composers and performers, have presented works at the Tuesday Musicale's concerts. Talented performers from Europe and other parts of the United States have come to Detroit to perform in the concerts and some local performers began their careers in concerts with the Tuesday Musicale.</dc:description>

A thorough history of the Parkside Homes project, as well as a brief description of the photographs in each file is included.</dc:description>
<dc:description>This collection contains the official report on Detroit's low income housing project called Parkside Homes. The report was compiled by Dr. Charles K. Hyde of Wayne State University for the Historic American Buildings Survey. Located at the corner of Connor and East Warren avenue on Detroit's east side, Parkside Homes was one of the earliest federal housing projects built in Detroit. During the 1930's economic depression, Detroit's housing construction had virtually stopped, yet the city's population continued to grow, especially with the advent of the Second World War. The project, with additions, was completed in 1940 and provided much needed low income housing. The Parkside Homes project was seen as a companion to the public housing project called Brewster Homes. Brewster Homes was "built in the Hastings Street slum clearance area and would be occupied exclusively by African-American families." The Parkside Homes project was designed as a "white housing project," for a "white neighborhood." The story of Detroit's public housing and the Parkside Homes project is an introduction to the history of race relations in Detroit.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The Women's City Club of Detroit was founded in 1919. Known as the Organization Committee, the small group of women came up with a constitution and bylaws, and rented space in a building on Bagley Avenue in downtown Detroit. By 1922 plans were made for the construction of their own building at Park Avenue and Elizabeth Street, which opened two years later. The new building included a swimming pool, restaurant, lounge, library and bedrooms for members and guests. It also contained a club laundry and auditorium. The club moved out of its rented quarters in April 1924.</dc:description>

<dc:description>George F. Pierrot was born January 11, 1898, in Chicago Illinois. The family moved to Ballard, Washington, a suburb of Seattle. His father, a physician and surgeon kept him out of school until he was eight years of age, although he was taught to read at five. He entered public school in the third grade, skipped another grade, and entered high school at twelve. There he debated for three years, leading the state team in his senior year. He was also class president, and editor of the school paper for two terms. He finished at the head of his class, and was chosen valedictorian. He took a year off before entering the University of Washington in Seattle, where he majored in Journalism, with English as a minor. His grades were of Phi-Beta-Kappa average until the middle of his junior year, when he started to cover the campus for the Seattle Times, and had his study time broken. His summers were spent working in salmon canneries in Alaska. After the summer following his junior year in 1918, he joined the Army, and was sent to officers training School. The Armistice came six weeks before he was to receive his commission. Not wanting to return home so soon, he and a friend embarked on a "Work your way around America expedition", ending up in Washington D.C. There they applied for a job on the Coast and Geodetic Survey's flagship "Surveyor". The ship sailed out of Norfolk, Virginia, for Alaska via the Panama Canal. He left the ship in Seattle in late June, 1919. That fall he returned to the University of Washington to receive his degree the following year. He subsequently worked at many writing jobs. In May of 1922 he accepted a position in Detroit, Michigan, as assistant managing editor of the American Boy Magazine. He later became managing editor. In 1933, while still editor of American Boy, he organized the World Adventure Series, a civic non profit illustrated lecture series at the Detroit Institute of Arts. This brought to Detroit the world's leading explorers, adventurers, and travelers. He thus built an enormous circle of friends in the travel-adventure field. In 1948 he was asked to present the World Adventure Series on TV, launching another facet of his career. He became very active in civic activities, various fraternities, and f clubs. He was instrumental in forming the Michigan Chapter of the Circumnavigators Club. His TV presentations ended in 1978. He retired from the World Adventure Series in 1979, and died February 16, 1980.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The St. Andrew's Society of Detroit was organized in 1849 by William Barclay and a number of Scottish residents of the city. The three main objectives of the Society are: to relieve Scots who are in need, both overseas and in the United States; to foster and encourage a love of Scotland, its history, literature, music and national games; and to promote friendly and social relations among its members and among all persons of Scottish ancestry. In addition to providing assistance to Scots in Detroit and in Scotland, the Society participated in a program of raising aid for British soldiers wounded or imprisoned during World War II and for the widows and dependents of British soldiers killed in action. Among the annual social events sponsored by the Society are the Robert Burns Concert and Ball in February, the Highland Picnic and Games in August, and a St. Andrew's Day Banquet in November. The St. Andrew's Society is open to all Scotsmen and their descendants. The elected officers of the Society are the president, two vice presidents, the financial secretary and a librarian. The appointed officers include a chaplain, a bard, an organist, and others. The general business meetings of the Society are held monthly and are open to all members.The Society is governed by an elected seven-member Board of Trustees which has general control of financial affairs. The Board receives all money turned over by the treasurer and invests it in the name of the Society. It also manages the Society's property and the St. Andrew's Hall. Throughout the years, this Hall has been the meeting place for many organizations in the city. The hall on E. Congress St. was closed in 1994. The Ladies Auxiliary of the St. Andrew's Society was formed in 1910. The Auxiliary is open to mothers, wives, sisters and daughters of members of the Society in good standing. The St. Andrew's Highlanders are the Pipe and Drum Corps of the Society. All members of the Society in good standing are eligible to join the Highlanders.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The Fred Hart Williams Genealogical Society was founded in 1979 in Detroit, Michigan. The purpose of the Society is to promote programs and research concerning African-American family history. The Society sponsors educational programs and workshops which explain the techniques of genealogical research most useful for persons of African ancestry. The Society honors the legacy of Fred Hart Williams (1882-1961), a Detroiter who was a pioneer in collecting and interpreting historical materials about African-Americans. Williams used his free time to serve the community as a newspaperman, author, historian, and patron of the arts. The Society also collects, preserves, and makes available to the public manuscripts, documents, genealogical records, and historical materials. Field trips are taken to examine sites and collections of family history records. The Society was the first and remains the only African-American genealogical society in Michigan and one of only two in the Midwest.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The Sorosis Literary and Art Club was founded on November 13, 1921 by founding members Mrs. William 0. Terrell, Mrs. Frank E. Dawson, Mrs. D.A. Stewart and Mrs. Alfred E. Thomas. These women, having moved to Detroit from the South shortly after World War I, organized this club where they could meet and share mutual interests in arts, crafts, literature, music and cultural events. The name Sorosis was selected because of its meaning-Greek for sisters. The club motto is "Utile Dulci" which means "The useful and the beautiful." Meetings today focus on stimulating discussions by guest speakers, art demonstrations, book reviews and travel and musical programs. The club maintains memberships in the Detroit Association of Women's Clubs, the Founder's Society of the Detroit Institute of Arts and the Friends of the Detroit Public Library.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Henry Leland was co-founder of the Cadillac Motor Car Co. and founder of the Lincoln Motor Co. With his son Wilfred and three others he formed the Leland and Faulconer Co., a manufacturer of machine tools, in Detroit in 1890. They expanded their products to internal combustion engines, manufacturing small boat engines and with an order placed by Ransom Olds, later began manufacturing automobile engines. Leland co-founded the Cadillac Automobile Co. in 1902 and later merged it with Leland and Faulconer to form the Cadillac Motor Car Co. Henry Leland continued as president and Wilfred as vice president of the company after it was sold to General Motors. After resigning from General Motors, they founded the Lincoln Motor Co. in 1917 which first produced airplane engines then turned to automobile production. The company ended up in receivership and was sold to Henry Ford.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The papers of Jesse G. Vincent were placed in the National Automotive History Collection of the Detroit Public Library in January of 1980 and were opened for research in May of 1999.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Mr. Vincent began his automotive career in 1910 by working at the Hudson Motor Car Company as their chief engineer. Two years later, Alvin Macauley, the general manager of Packard, hired Mr. Vincent as Packard's chief engineer. At Packard, he developed the Twin Six, a 12-cylinder engine that was well received by the automobile industry. In 1915 he was appointed engineering vice president of Packard; a position he held until his retirement in 1949. He served on Packard's board of directors from 1945-1954. Mr. Vincent co-designed the World War I Liberty engine for which he received a colonelcy in the Army reserves. During World War II he designed the PT boat engine; he also contributed to the design of the Rolls Royce fighter plane engine. With the aid of Gar Wood, he designed racing engines for hydroplanes that won numerous Gold Cup records. Mr. Vincent was a long-standing member of the Society of Automotive Engineers, serving as president in 1920. He was a fellow of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers and of the Institute of Aeronautical Sciences. He was also a member of the Engineering Society of Detroit. He served as a director of the Automobile Association of America and of the Auto Club. He also served as president of the Automobile Club of Michigan. In 1929 the University of Michigan honored him with a Master of Engineering degree in recognition of his engineering contributions to the development of the automotive industry, and for the conspicuous service rendered to his country . His first wife, Clarinda Blood, died in June of 1943. He married his second wife, Rachel Robinson Hawes, in November of 1943: she died on May 10, 1974. There were no children from either marriage. Mr. Vincent died on April 20, 1962.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Born near Canton, Ill. on Dec. 15, 1861, Duryea was first interested in bicycles and in 1888 formed the Duryea Manufacturing Co. in Washington, D.C. to produce his Sylph bicycle. As an expert in patents, he testified for Henry Ford in the Selden v. Ford patent trial.

In 1898 the brother parted company to pursue separate careers in the automobile industry. Charles continued to produce automobiles without financial success under a number of company names. He died in 1938.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Allen Varley Astin Papers 1939-1973 (bulk 1950-1970) 1950 - 1970</dc:title>

<dc:description>The papers of Allen Varley Astin (1904-1984) span the years 1921-1984 with the bulk of the material concentrated in the period 1950-1970. The collection is organized into three series. The National Bureau of Standards  series documents Astin's forty-year career at the bureau, most especially his role as director, 1952-1969. The Professional Activities series documents his association with scientific, academic, governmental, and public administration organizations. A small file concerning his term as acting assistant secretary for science and technology at the Commerce Department is combined with a few family and personal papers into a Miscellany series.The National Bureau of Standards  series relates to all phases of Astin's career, including his earliest scientific research in measurement techniques for dielectric (electric insulating) materials, telemetering, and electronic instrumentation. Since the National Bureau of Standards was founded in 1901 to coincide with the electrification of American industry, Astin's initial research was among the work most emphasized at the bureau. During World War II, ordnance research dominated its program, and Astin was one of the scientists assembled at the bureau in 1940 to develop proximity fuses for bombs and rockets. In 1944 and 1945, he represented the bureau in London working in liaison with the Office of Scientific Research and Development and the British armed forces. Astin's proximity fuse file chiefly documents technical and tactical matters, yet reference is also made to the strategic decision not to use proximity fuses in Europe and to their limited use in the Burma and China.  Astin's papers also document his active leadership in the formulation of public policy relating to science. The National Bureau of Standards  series provides a record of his influence, including his role in the controversy over negative findings on the battery additive marketed as "AD-X2." Dismissed by Secretary of Commerce Sinclair Weeks, Astin was exonerated by a scientific council appointed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower and overseen by the National Academy of Sciences. A subsequent report to the Secretary of Commerce made recommendations, which Astin helped to develop, for a reorganization of the National Bureau of Standards which eliminated ordnance research from its program and emphasized its primary role in establishing measurement standards and reliable properties of materials. Documentation for the AD-X2 controversy is located principally in the administrative file of the series.Eisenhower approved the committee recommendations, reinstated Astin, and transferred the ordnance program to the Defense Department. Two new laboratories were then established by Defense: the Harry Diamond Laboratory in Washington, D.C., and the Corona Laboratory in California. Astin's association with these laboratories is documented in the Professional Activities series. Reorganization and relocation of the bureau to Gaithersburg, Maryland, is documented in the administrative file of the National Bureau of Standards  series. In addition, the publications file in the same series includes Astin's 1968 interview for the Columbia University oral history of the Eisenhower administration and a draft manuscript for the bicentennial history of the bureau, "Measures of Assurance," both of which treat the AD-X2 controversy and bureau reorganization. Some of Astin's 1953 speeches in the National Bureau of Standards series also refer to the controversy.Public speaking and publication files in the National Bureau of Standards  series document Astin's articulation of the bureau's mission to governmental, scientific, and civic groups throughout the country and at European and Asian conferences. His extensive involvement in scientific associations, documented in the Professional Activities series, reflects the rise of late-twentieth-century research by committee and Astin's influence on the agenda of research programs in private and public laboratories. Other files in the Professional Activities series concern his efforts in scientific panels and governmental committees to define an autonomous role for scientists in public service. Papers documenting Astin's role in international matters include the International Committee on Weights and Measures file in the National Bureau of Standards  series and files for his work with State Department cooperative science programs in France and Japan in the Professional Activities series. Astin initiated studies at the bureau which were used in support of the Metric Conversion Act of 1975. The United States Metric Board file in the Professional Activities series documents his later work on national conversion.Several letters and a few school and theatrical papers in the Miscellany series pertain to Astin's son, the actor John Astin, who is known for his portrayal of "Gomez" on the 1960s television show, "The Addams Family."</dc:description>

<dc:description>Papers contain accounts, correspondence, photographs and newspaper articles about this Detroit company.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Located on W. Fort Street in Detroit, this was the first automatic, conveyor-style car wash in the world, founded by Paul Maraian in 1946. The machine could wash one car every two minutes, and could handle up to 750 cars in one day. By 1954 that number jumped to nearly 2,000. After Paul Maraian died in 1969, his family kept the business open and renovated it to keep up with the times. by the 1980's the business had become computerized, and more efficient dryers and new steam-cleaning brushes were installed. In the early 1990s, however, the Maraian family sold the business and it became known as Hollywood Car Wash. It closed in 1994 and the building was torn down soon afterwords.</dc:description>
