## MY UNITARIAN UNIVERSALIST COMMONPLACE BOOK 	

"For Unitarian Universalists, the question is never "What do you believe?" but rather 'What kind of person have you become? What are the fruits of your living?'" - Marilyn Sewell (from http://www.huffingtonpost.com/marilyn-sewell/unitarian-universalist-theology_b_870528.html)

Sermon by Rev. Barbara Gilday, â€œIntroduction to Unitarian Universalism, Sept. 25, 2011. https://orcasuu.wordpress.com/archive/sermon-by-rev-barbara-gilday-introduction-to-unitarian-universalism-sept-25-2011/

## UU: what is it? 
* The term Unitarian affirms the unity of all life.
* The term Universalism indicates universality of religion itself.
* (from http://icuu.net/membergroups/memberpages/united%20states.html)

## Rev. David O. Rankin's, "What we believe" 
* We believe in the freedom of religious expression. All individuals should be encouraged to develop their own personal theology, and to present openly their 
religious opinions without fear of censure or reprisal.
* We believe in the toleration of religious ideas. All religions, in every age and culture, possess not only an intrinsic merit, but also a potential value for 
those who have learned the art of listening.
* We believe in the authority of reason and conscience. The ultimate arbiter in religion is not a church, or a document, or an official, but the personal choice 
and decision of the individual.
* We believe in the never-ending search for Truth. If the mind and heart are truly free and open, the revelations which appear to the human spirit are infinitely 
numerous, eternally fruitful, and wondrously exciting.
* We believe in the unity of experience. There is no fundamental conflict between faith and knowledge, religion and the world, the sacred and the secular, since 
they all have their source in the same reality.
* We believe in the worth and dignity of each human being. All people on earth have an equal claim to life, liberty, and justice -- and no idea, ideal, or 
philosophy is superior to a single human life.
* We believe in the ethical application of religion. Good works are the natural product of a good faith, the evidence of an inner grace that finds completion in 
social and community involvement.
* We believe in the motive force of love. The governing principle in human relationships is the principle of love, which always seeks the welfare of others and 
never seeks to hurt or destroy.
* We believe in the necessity of the democratic process. Records are open to scrutiny, elections are open to members, and ideas are open to criticism -- so that 
people might govern themselves.
* We believe in the importance of a religious community. The validation of experience requires the confirmation of peers, who provide a critical platform along 
with a network of mutual support.

## UU: The religion 
* many scriptures, not one
* here and now, not the hereafter
* freedom, reason, tolerance, love as overarching values
* deeds not creeds, show your work, live your faith
* evolutionary theology, language changes
* we are saved by Love, made holy by character
* no original sin, God is Love
* unity of experience: faith & knowledge, sacred & secular
* non-creedal, authority of conscience
* need for religious community
* congregational polity, democratic methods
* a spark of "divinity" or the "highest good" in every person
* a destination: an earth made fair, all her people one, we co-create the world

## THE FLAMING CHALICE
A flame within a chalice (a cup with a stem and foot) is a primary symbol of the Unitarian Universalist faith tradition. Many of our congregations kindle a 
flaming chalice in gatherings and worships and feature the chalice symbol prominently. 

Hans Deutsch, an Austrian artist, first brought together the chalice and the flame as a Unitarian symbol during his work with the Unitarian Service Committee 
during World War II. To Deutsch, the image had connotations of sacrifice and love. Unitarian Universalists today have many different interpretations of the 
flaming chalice, including the light of reason, the warmth of community, and the flame of hope. 

Our current official UUA logo debuted in 2014, offering a visual representation of a modern and dynamic faith. Unitarian Universalist congregations are free to 
use the UUA's logo in their congregational work, but they are not required to do so. Because of this, you may see many different styles of flaming chalices and 
other images used by Unitarian Universalist congregations.
