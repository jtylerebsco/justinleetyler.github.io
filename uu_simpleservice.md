# welcome and Happy [day, or holiday]

Our opening words come from [name], "quote'

Once again we welcome you to the digital space of the First Unitarian Universalist Church of Lubbock. Ours is a religious community of free minds. All are welcome to join us. all are welcome. All the colors of the rainbow are welcome. whatever definitions you have given yourself, whatever designations you've been given by others: you are welcome. Central to our identity as Unitarian Universalists is the concept of the free pulpit and the free pew. The free pulpit means our speaker can speak the truth as she or he sees it. The free pew means that we as members are not required to agree with everything we hear. Unitarian Universalism draws from many sources and faith traditions. Our services are varied and diverse as is our lay lay community. I hope that some elements of the service comfort you and that you will be open to new experiences. If an element of the service does not appeal to you, rejoice that someone else might be touched by it.

I am [name] and I'm your service leader today. 

Now please take a moment to think about the people you love. Reach out today: call, text, email, video chat with someone for your mental health and for theirs.

Each week we light a flame in our chalice as a symbol of our history and to celebrate our freedom of religious expression. [Name] will light the chalice today.

Our chalice lighting words are from [name], "Quote".

joys and concerns 
Since the times are strange and I know that we all have joys and many concerns, I will now place the stone for me and all of you at home in our community candle tray. And I will place the second stone for everything that is going on in the world as a whole.

Reminder: the church continues to function, and staff continues to work. So please mail in your pledges or other contributions to the church office, or go to our website online and use the donate button now.
