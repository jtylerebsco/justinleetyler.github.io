Out in the woods, a porcupine escapes the deepening snow by climbing in a maple tree. The peaceful creature's hair has evolved into the barbed quills, or barbules, that have ravaged the faces of many a stray dog. It will survive on gnawed bark until the tree dies, then reluctantly waddle to another.

As the old saying goes: "If December is changable and mild, the whole winter wil remain a child".

Underneath the backyard, black ants have retreated into their deepest chambers, were they huddle together to fend off the chill. Little black ants, which live throughout the United States, are one of the least studied species.

A fertilized queen bee languishes in the attic. She will reproduce in the spring, when warm weather returns.

in 1778, the Hessian Storm hit southern New England. Temperatures dropped below ero, and 18 inches of snow fell. More than 50 people froze to death, including nine Hessian mercenaries who died at their posts in Newport. The American bring *General Arnold* foundered off Plymouth, going down with nearly 100 lost.

The beginning of the French farmers' *jours des lots* ("days of fate"). Superstitious farmers set aside 12 onions, one for each month, and place a pinch of salt on each. On Epiphany, the onions are examined: If the salt has melted, the corresponding month will be wet; if the salt remains crystalline, the month will be dry. Closer to home, folk philosophers tell us that if Christmas is in snow, Easter is in mud.

Out in the Green Mountains, the most dangerous animal in America browses at the edge of a stand of pine trees. Each year, about 100 people are killed when cars collide with deer.

A 30-pound bobcat hunkers down on its perch in an oak tree above a game trail in the high country. We rarely see them, but they're out there; the pancake=sized tracks in the snow and the bloody turfs of fur from its rabbit dinner give proof.
## 12/22
Out in the backyard, deep in the cold mud below the frost line, a starnosed mole goes about its business, tunneling after worms adnd slugs 20 inches below the surface. The 6-inch-long bundle of fur aquired its name from the fan of 22 pink tentacle-like projections radiating from its snout.

The Winter Solstice. Our shortest day. Only nine hours of daylight.

## 12/20
Snow season is in full swing. But count your blessings - 20 percent of the Earth's surface is permanently covered with snow. In some sections of Siberia, the permafrost extends to a depth of 5,000 feet.

## 12/19
A ruffed grouse explodes from cover im a strand of pine trees. Locals call the grouse "partridges" and sometimes - because they make so much noise - "thunder chickens." Don't look for them in a pear tree. They hunker down in pine trees at this time of the year.

## 12/01
A flock of mewing fulls descends ona  discarded bag on Penobscot Bay. You don't see any first-year herring gulls now. They have gone south and will be back in late spring. Older, crustier gulls touch it out.

## 11/30
Some lavender asters sill blossom on south-facing spots. Tradition tells us that flowers that bloom in late autumn are a portent of bad winter.
