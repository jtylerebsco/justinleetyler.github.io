A flock of mewing fulls descends ona  discarded bag on Penobscot Bay. You don't see any first-year herring gulls now. They have gone south and will be back in late spring. Older, crustier gulls touch it out.

Some lavender asters sill blossom on south-facing spots. Tradition tells us that flowers that bloom in late autumn are a portent of bad winter.
