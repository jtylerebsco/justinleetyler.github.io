# Welcome
Holy and beautiful the custom which brings us together [in the presence of the Most High]: To face our ideals, to remember our loved ones in absence, to give thanks, to make confession, to offer forgiveness, to be enlightened, and to be strenthened. Through this quiet hour breathes the worship of ages, the cathedral music of history. Three unseen guests attend, Faith, Hope and Love. Let our our hearts prepare them place. --Robert French Leavens

# Confession

V. The years of all of us are short, our lives precarious.  
R. Our days and nights go hurrying on and there is scarcely time to do the little that we might.  
V. Yet we find time for bitterness, for petty treason and evasion.  
R. What can we do to stretch our hearts enough to lose their littleness?  
V. Here we are - all of us - all upon this planet, bound together in a common destiny,  
R. Living our lives between the briefness of the daylight and the dark.  
V. Kindred in this, each lighted by the same precarious, flickering flame of life, how does it happen that we are not kindred in all things else?  
R. How strange and foolish are the walls of separation that divide us!  
--A. Powell Davies

# Chalice Lighting

Glory be to the earth and the wind.  
Glory be to the sun and the rain.  
Glory be to animals and children and women and men,  
Glory be to our holy flame which calls us together as one.

# Prayer

Eternal Spirit, whom we call God, you are our life. You are the best and most beautiful in us and beyond us. Your spirit is in animals, birds, plants, and in people whom we do not know or who seem very different from us. All of us share the gift of life. Help us to remember that life is good. Help us to know that we don't stop loving people or other living things when they are no longer close to us. Love lasts always. May we look for ways to love one another, and to love all living things. Amen. --Licinda Steven Duncan

# Flower Communion

## Opening Words

Children of the earth and sky, we are nurtured, sustained, given warmth and light from above and below. Supported by earth's strong, firm crust, we build our homes, till the fields, plant our gardens and orchards. When we turn from self and seek to be aware, we will find holy light in human faces, in blossom, birdsong, and sky. Then earth is truly our home, and we are one with all earth's creatures, Parents of earth's children yet to be. -- Alice Berry

## Song: "Spring Has Now Unwrapped the Flowers"
(sung to the tune of the old English Christmas carol, "Good King Wenceslas)

"Spring has now unwrapped the flowers, Day is fast reviving; Life in all her growing powers, Towards the light is striving; Gone the iron touch of cold, Winter time and frost time; Seedlings working through the mold, Now make up for lost time. All the world with beauty fills, Gold the green enhancing; Flowers make merry on the hills, Set the meadows dancing. Earth puts on her dress of glee; Flowers and grasses hide her. Go we forth in charity, One and all beside her.

## The Flower Communion
(You or a member of your group may read the following paragraphs aloud:)

The Unitarian Universalist Flower Communion service which we arc about to celebrate was originated in 1923 by Dr. Norbert Capek [pronounced Chah-Peck], founder of the modem Unitarian movement in Czechoslovakia. On the last Sunday before the summer recess of the Unitarian church in Prague, all the children and adults participated in this colorful ritual, which gives concrete expression to the humanity-affirming principles of our liberal faith. When the Nazis took control of Prague in 1940, they found Dr. Capek's gospel of the inherent worth and beauty of every human person to be-as Nazi court records show-- "...too dangerous to the Reich [for him] to be allowed to live." Dr. Capek was sent to Dachau, where he was killed the next year during a Nazi "medical experiment." This gentle man suffered a cruel death, but his message of human hope and decency lives on through his Flower Communion, which is widely celebrated today. It is a noble and meaning-filled ritual we arc about to recreate. This service includes the original prayers of Dr. Capek to help us remember the principles and dreams for which he died.

## The Consecration
(Whenever Dr. Capek conducted his Flower Communion in Prague. he would say this proverb as he "consecrated" the flowers:)

Infinite Spirit of Life, we ask thy blessing on these, thy messengers of fellowship and love. May they remind us. amid diversities of knowledge and of gifts, to be one in desire and affection, and devotion to thy holy will. May they also remind us of the value of comradeship, of doing and sharing alike. May we cherish friendship as one of thy most precious gifts. May we not let awareness of another's talents discourage us, or sully our relationship, but may we realize that, whatever we can do, great or small, the efforts of all of us are needed to do thy work in this world.

## Partaking of the Communion
(If you are celebrating the communion with your family or small group say:)

It is time now for us to share in the Flower Communion. I ask that as you each in turn approach the communion vase you do so quietly--reverently--with a sense of how important it is for each of us to address our world and one another with gentleness, justice, and love. I ask that you select a flower--different from the one you brought--that particularly appeals to you. As you take your chosen flower--noting its particular shape and beauty--please remember to handle it carefully. It is a gift that someone else has brought to you. It represents that person's unique humanity, and therefore deserves your kindest touch. Let us share quietly in this Unitarian Universalist ritual of oneness and love. The communion is shared silently.

(If you are celebrating the communion by yourself, read:)

It is time now for the Flower Communion. As I gaze upon the flowers before me, I do so quietly--reverently-- with a sense of how important it is to address our world and other persons with gentleness, justice. and love. 

(As you now touch each flower. speak the name of a person who is dear to you. Each blossom represents a person's' unique humanity. and therefore deserves your kindness touch. Quietly share now in this Unitarian Universalist ritual of human oneness and love.) 

## The Communion Prayer
(Listen now to Dr. Capek's Flower Communion prayer:)

In the name of Providence, which implants in the seed the future of the tree and in the hearts of men [and women] the longing for people living in [human] love; in the name of the highest. in whom we move and who makes the mother [and father], the brother and sister what they are; in the name of sages and great religious leaders, who sacrificed their lives to hasten the coming of [peace and justice]--let us renew our resolution--sincerely to be real brothers and sisters regardless of any kind of bar which estranges [one from another]. In this holy resolution may we be strengthened, knowing that we are God's family, that one spirit, the spirit of love, unites us, and [may we] endeavor for a more perfect and more joyful life. Amen.

## Closing Words
(Just before he was put to death in Dachau, Dr. Capek wrote this prayer. reflecting on his own life and the state of his spirit:)

It is worthwhile to live and fight courageously for sacred ideals. Oh blow ye evil winds into my body's fire; my soul you'll never unravel. Even though disappointed a thousand times or fallen in the fight and everything would worthless seem, I have lived amidst eternity. Be grateful, my soul, My life was worth living. He who was pressed from all sides but remained victorious in spirit is welcomed into the choir of heroes. He who overcame the fetters giving wing to the mind is entering into the golden age of the victorious.
