> ... poetic time [is] oriented toward process rather than productivity. -q
> walking meditation -f
> When an altar is used, it is regarded as a place of contact with the deity, set apart as holy. -q
> [An Altar is] a gathering place for my own sacred objects. -q
> East: the direction of spring, air, birth, and dawn  -- South: summer, fire, youth, midday -- West: autumn, water, adulthood, twilight -- North: winter, earth, old age, midnight. -f
> The only ways to mark the passage of time are the changes in light... -q
> ... reading, the holy lies not in the object, but in the activity and experience of the reader. -q
> A spiritual practice is any regular, intentional activity that serves to significantly deepen the quality and content of your relationship with the miracle of life. -q
> Nourishing Wisdom, Marc David writes, 'Be there when you eat. Achieve the fullest experience of your food. Taste it. Savor it. Pay attention to it. Rejoice in it.' Eating is a sacred act ... -q

> The spiritual numbness of the dominating culture is at the heart of its violence. Overt acts of violence against one another and against the earth emerge from a more covert violence: the loss of our capacities to feel and think. This loss happens through the suppression of the senses, of desire and of feeling; through the exile of pain and grief; and through the silencing of human dependence on one another and the earth. Critical analysis alone will not disempower this culture, nor will it change its effects. We need to recover our abilities to think and feel. Anesthetization needs to end in our lives. -q

> All of us have become dis-integrated and experienced the mind-body split. If re-integration is our goal, then the methods involved should include something physical as well as mental. To the extent that there is re-integration, there is healing, and he furthering of one's spiritual journey. -q
> ... in his A Brief History of Everything, philosopher Ken Wilber argues that many of our current difficulties can be traced to the Western world's failure to develope any 'truly contemplative practices.' -q

> CH. 11: A discussion on how Jesus may have seen himself (as the Davidic Son of Man); and the "Kingdom of God". -s
> CH. 12: A discussion of Jesus's entry into Jeruselum, and death on the cross for the crime of Sedition. -s 
> CH. 14: Serious tentions between Paul and the Jerusalem community (Paul, James, etc.) -s
> The notion of history  as a critical analysis of obervable and verifiable events int he past is a product of the modern age; it would have been an altogether foreign concept to the gospel writers for whom history was not a matter of uncovering facts, but revealing truths.  -p. 21 -q
> John promised the Jews who came to him a new world order, the Kingdom of God. And while he never developed the concept beyond the vague notion of equality and justice, the promise itself was enough in thosee dark, turbulent times to draw to him a wave of Jews from all walks of life... -p. 82 -q
> John [the Baptist] is presented not as a member of a community but as a loner, a solitary voice calling out in the wilderness. -p. 85 -q
> When Jesus was born, Galilee was aflame. His first decade of life coincided with the plunder and destruction of ghe Galilean countryside, his second with its refashioning at the hands of Antipas. -p. 93 -q
> It would be these people whom Jesus would specifically target -- those who found themselves cast to the fringes of society, whose lives had been disrupted by the rapid social and economic shifts taking place throughout Galilee... Jesus's message was designed to be a direct challenge to the wealthy and the powerful, be they the occupiers in Rome, the collaborators in the Temple, or the new moneyed class in the Greek cities of Galilee. The message was simple: the Lord God has seen the suffering of the poor and dispossesed; he had heard their cries and anguish. And he was finally going to do something about it. -p. 96 -q
> With the Temple in ruins and the Jewish religion made pariah, the Jews who followed Jesus as messiah had an easy decision to make: they could either maintain their cultic connections to their parent religion and share in Rome's enmity (Rome's enmity towards Christians would peak much later), or they could divorce themselves from Judaism and tranform their messiah from a fierce Jewish nationalist into a pacifistic preacher of good works whose kingdom was not of this world. -p. 150 -q
> It was not only fear of Roman reprisal that drove these early Christians... a generation after Jesus's crucifixion, his non-followers outnumbered and overshadowed the Jewish ones. -p. 150 -q
> In the gospel of John, written in Ephesus sometime after 100 C.E. ... -p. 152 -q
> As with everything else in the gospels, the story of Jesus's arrest, trial, and excecution was written for one reason and one reason only: to prove that he was the promised messiah. -p. 154 -q
> But try as he might, Luke cannot avoid the most basic fact about his messiah: Jesus was executed by the Roman state for the crime of sedition. -p. 156 -q
> Nothing quite like what these followersof Jesus were contending [the taking of his corpse to an extravagant tomb; and the resurrection] existed at the time... But the concept of an individual dying and rising again, in the flesh, into a life everlasting was extremely rare in the ancient world and practically nonexistent in Judaism. -p. 165 -q
> ... this new,innovative, and thoroughly unorthodox interpretation of the messiah being peddled by a group of illiterate ecstatics whos ecertainty in their message was matched only by the passion with which they preached it. -p. 167 -q
> As with most converts from the distant Diasppora, he [Stephen] would have abandoned his hometown, sold his posessions, pooled his resources into the community, and made a home for himself in Jerusalem, undder th shadow of the Temple walls. -p. 167 -q
> The Son of Man, in Stephen's vision... is, in form and substance, God made flesh. -p. 169 -q
> The story of the zealous Galilean peasant and Jewish nationalist who donned the mantle of messiah and launched a foolhardy rebellion against the corrupt Temple priesthood and the vicious Roman occupation comes to an abrupt end, not with his death on the cross, nor with the empty tumb, but at the first moment one of his followers dares to suggest the he is God. Stephen [who made this clame] was martyred sometime between 33and 35 C.E. -p. 169 -q
> James's steady leadership over the Jerusalem assembly came to an end in 62 C.E., when he was executed by the high priest Ananus... p. 212 -q 
> For in the year 66 C.E., the same year that Jerusalem errupted in revolt, the emperor Nero, reacting to the sudden surge of Christian persecution in Rome, seized Peter and Paul and executed them both for espousing what he assumed was the same faith. -p. 196 -q

> On the basis of slender evidence, mostly the circumstances of his bachelorhood and three asides by contemporaries about his effeminacy, Buchanan has been dubbed America's first homosexual president. Referring to his femininity, Andrew Jackson once calleed him an 'Aunt Nancy'... Absent the discovery of new material, no one will ever know whether Buchanan and King (the only man whom his name was ever erotically connected) had sexual relations.  -p. 25 -q
> The best speculation about the sexuality of nonshaving Buchanan, who in his portrates has eunuchlike, endomorphic features of body and face as well as the low hairline characteristic of asexual men with low levels of testosterone, is that he had little interest in sex. -p. 26 -q
> Buchanan's letters to Harriet and all his faimly were the austere, distant expressions of a lifetime bachelor. p. 49 -q
> Buchanan did not campaign; such entreaties by the candidate himself were considered violations of the national understanding that conferring public office was a gift of the people. -p. 71 -q

> ... Buchanan gave every indication of severe mental strain affecting both his health and his judgement. -p. 130 -q
> ... It [Buchanan's prosouthernism] rests in his social and cultural iddentification with what he perceived as thesouther values of leisure, the gentleman's code of honor, and what George Cary Eggleston, a Virginia writer, once called 'a soft dreamy deliciously quiet life... with all its sharp corners removed. -p. 137 -q

> Here, Krishna is an Incarnation of the Divine Ground in human form. -p. 17 -q
> At the core of the Perennial Philosophy we find four fundamental doctrines: First, the phenomenal world of matter and of individualized consciousness... is the manifestation of a Divine Ground within... second: human beings... can... realize its existence by a direct intuition... Third: man possesses a double nature, a phenomenal ego and an external Self... Fourth: mans life on earth has only one purpose: to identify himself with the eternal Self and so to come to unitive knowledge of the Divine Ground. -p. 13 -q

> ... while politics is all about how we're going to make the world better, progressive religion tells us why it's necessary to work for change... Liberal faith traditions offer the essential metaphors and worldview that everything else derives from - the frames that give our dreams shape and meaning. It ha an invaluable role to play in helping our movement set its values and priorities, understand where we are in the larger scheme, and guage whether we're succeeding or not. -Sara Robinson -p. x -q

> Religious communities acts to bind us in covenant to one another and to purposes greater than oursevels - not merely as an agreement among mortals but as a shared human response to a sense of grace, interdependency, and responsibility. -p. xii -q
> ... Soteriology - from the Greek soteria, which means salvation, deliverance, preservation, or release. Religion, at its best, provides shelter for people and communiies in need of healing, transformation, or sustenance in difficulity. -p. xii -q
> What about God? How can we , or do we, speak of the ultimate mystery that is the source and sustenance of our lives - the source that some people call God? -p. xii -q
> In the liberal heritage, the notion that humanity is created in the image of God is foundational, making reflection on human experience a primary source of theology... -p. xiii -q
> How might liberal religion reclaim a doctrine of the Spirit - a pneumation (from the Greek pneuma, 'breath' or 'wind' - that affirms the importance of ritual and art? -p. xiii -q

> [Unitarian Universalism] embraces multireligious life and learning found a tthe intersections... of spirituality. We share our reflections on these particular traditions as a gift, not a limit... we affirm religious pluralism, callaboration, and intrchange while simultaneously being grounded in our particular heritages of faith and practice. We seek to extend the welcome and the resources of progressive theology to people who are searching for a religious home that can support hteir aspirations of a just and sustainable world. At the same time, we are grateful for the opportunity to be guests at the tables of religious fellowship with others and to join with them in mutual learning and ranformation. -p. xxii -q

> My suspiciaon is that religious conservatism has grown not because its theology is more inspiring than that of liberal theology, but because conservatives in recent decades have been better at creating and sustaining religious communities that offer people meaningful connections with one another and support in enduring life's trials and tribulations. -p. 37 -q
> I traveled a few summers ago to visit Unitarian congregations in TRansylvania. Part of the Hungarian minority in omania, the Unitarian mantained a space for reason and science as part of religion. -p. 39 -q
> Such community is established less by a historic creed or by apostolic tradition than by covenantal relations among the members. The role and responsibility of the members includes thinking for themselves, excercising their power to interpret scripture, to bless what is holy and to critique what is unjust, in a 'priesthood and prophethood of all believers.' Diversity and dissent are holy gifts. Rituals and spiritual practices are subjected to ethical criteria: do they support actions that are compassionate and just? -p. 41 -q
> In place of an established creed that all consented to, people were consent to to the common agreements of the community, worked out through democratic process. -p. 41 -q
> To help myself, I started each morning by sitting quietly to meditate and concentrate my awareness on love. I created an altar to help myself remember my sense of purpose.

> Much in our dominant culture can lull people into numbness, complacency, or compliance. -p. 45 -q
> 'What do we all belive in common? What ancient formulae of faith are we willing to confess together?' in favor of the more covenantal questions: 'What spiritual hopes do we share? What shall we cpromise o one another and to God as we try to live together toward our hopes? How shall we then try to treat one another? -p. 51 -q
> All people need a framework of meaning by which to negotiate the 'many dangers, toils, and snares' that confront their lives. Our frameworks support us when threats come. They even shape what threats we see and guide what response we choose as trustworthy or wise. -p. 62 -q
> The alternative theology of salvation emphasizes (1) that human beings need to be saved from the consequences of human sin - no from God's punishing wrath; and (2) that salvation comes through the powers of live and goodness, present within and around us. -p. 63 -q
> In sum, the liberal theoloical perspective emphasizes that both sin and salvation ,evil and the redemption of evil, are in our hands. -p. 63 -q
> Sin matters not becauwe it disspponts, offends, or alienates God, but because it destroys life-giving relationships of love and justice in human affairs - leaving ragedy and broken hearts in its wake. -p. 67 -q
> What is evil? Evil is that which exploits the lives of some to benefit the lives of others. -p. 68 -q
> The consequences of evil are displayed by trouble in earth's ecosystems - disappearing species, melting ice caps, the tinning ozone. -p. 68 -q
> Calness in the face of evil comes to those who, rather than being frantic to pure it, concentrte their attention on recognizing and resising its habits. This is the gift of age, of elders, of long=practiced care for life. -p. 69-70 -q
> Christians are anointed like Jesus, imbued with the spirit of life, o heal the sick, release the captive, feed the hungry, and tase and see the goodness of God in this world. -p. 71 -q
> In early Christian worship practices, those who took part in the Eucharist ritual would touch their eyes and ears and nostrils with fingers dipped in the communion wine. 'Everything belongs to the God of beauty,' -p. 71 -q

> That notoriously terse New Englander Calvin Coolidge... -p. 79 -q
> Recently, however, liberals have been in danger of abandoning that attempt, walking away from it, and leaving the Bible and its interpretation to conservates to use patrnalistic and oppressive ways. -p. 79 -q
> Sometimes we need to be reminded that all literature, sacred and profane alike, relies on metaphor. -p. 83 -q
> The most ancient shrine described in the Bible was a rock. -p. 93 -q
> The divine-human encounter is the rock on which our theological house stands. -p. 93 -q
> Rather than submitting to extablished doctrine, human beings could to know God from observation of the world and contemplation of human experience. -p. 96 -q
> Revelaton comes to those who are radically hospitable to what they do not know. -p. 102 -q
> Rooted in science, reason, and intuition, process theology provides a way of understanding the existence o fgod that progressive theology can embrace in the 21st century. -p. 105 -q

> The challenge is to not let our hearts be turnd to stone by tragedy but to meld with oen another in a reconstruction of faith of love. -p. 117 -q	
> But, at its best, sexal intimacy can reveal the powers of the soul - our ability to feel and be affected, our capcity for both vulnerability and power, to receive and to give. -p. 131 -q
> I can see that feminist theology is rather like Quakerism: it looks to the authority of our won inner light - our experience - as a basis for religion. -p. 131 -q
> Homo economicus - the economic human - of market capitalism is self-nterested, focused on immediate gratification of wants and needs, and unconcerned with twhat happens to others in the process of getting his needs met. At every turn, the market - the dominant religion of our day - tells us and our children that htis is who we are and who we should be. But this concept of the human being, in fact, diminishes and dehumanizes the fullness of those who humans are and can be. -p. 133 -q
> The challenge for people of faith now is to counter market capitalism's joyless, diminished view of humanities and its lifethreatenng effects on earth's ecoologies. -p. 134 -q
> At the core of authentic religion is the spirit of hospitality. All three Abramic faiths recognize this. the tent of Abraham is open on all four sies o welcome the stranger from anywhere, say the rabbis. The infamous sin of ancient Sodom ws no same-sex love, scholars say, but rather a brutal violation of strangers who should have been treated wih hospitality. -p. 140 -q
> Today, many people say, 'I am spiritual but not religous.' They want to connect more deeply with the Spirit, but they have little confidence that the Spirit is going to show up at a worhship service or religous ritual. They might be right. Even in the bible, the Spirit shows up on mountainops, along roadsides, and in humble homes and rooms moe often than it does in designation places of worhsip, ritual, and assembly. -p. 148 -q
> [The Spirit]is holy because it yearns for harmony, justice, wholeness. -p. 151 -q
> Many other Protestants do not realize how deeply their basic pattern of worship comes from ancient synagogue practice: a prayer of invocation; a psalm chanted (or later a hymn sung, many growing out of psalms); a scriptural reading or two; prayers; a sermon explicating and applying the spiritual wisdom of the scriptures; a final psalm or hymn; and a blessing. -p. 153 -q
> One familiar Christian approach frames outsides as nonbelievers who need to be saved. From this perspective there is only one true household of faith, and the mission of the religious community is to make all outsiders into insiders, to convert and assimilate the Other. Another perspective is possible. A theological house can be a place of hospitality to any who seek its shelter; it can honor religious diversity and wlcome creative exchange among multiple religious practices and perspectives. IT can greet the Other as a holy guest and urge its own residents to venture out to engage with the world. This is the way of progressive faith: An open door stands at the threshold of our theological house, is doorsill well-worn by comings and goings. -p. 164 -q
> The world's various religious traditions can e respected as manifestations of God's life-giving spirit that creates splendid diversity - not uniformity. -p. 169 -q
> People of progressive faith care for the sacredness of this world, this life, here and now. We do not look to a world to come that will be more valuable than this world. -p. 170 -q
> The crucifying powers remain active in the world. Liberal theologian Walter Rauschenbusch named these forces militarism, religious biotry, mob-spirit, greed and economic exploitation, and corruption of justice systems. These are the sins, he said, that killed Jesus. -p. 171 -q
> The mission of progressive faith is to embrace the beauty of diversity and the diversity of beauty; to resist the crucifying powers by ministries of solidarity; to love one another and this earth as paradise, here and now, the place Jesus prmised us we would be when he said, "Today you will be with me in paradise." -p. 172 -q
> The mission of liberal religion is to make religion more liberal and to make liberals moe religious. -Wallace Robbins -p. 175 -q
> But the amazing thing to me about the Unitarian Union of Northease India is that it is not the product of mission work; it is an indigenious movement that looked for partners. -p. 178 -q

> “collective effervescence,”
> The ultimate object of worship he sees in a society’s church is society itself. “God,” he writes in Elementary Forms, “and society are one of the same.… The god of the clan
> What matters is that participants have a common symbolic object of worship—and that they have rituals and routines to help them solidify their social bonds around that object.
> The social function of religion comes in the way it gives us a sense of personal and social meaning, allowing us to frame our identities within that of a collective cosmic narrative. “It is not happiness that theodicy primarily provides,” Berger ultimately concludes, “but meaning.”30
> foundational theodicy. It explains why there is evil and suffering in the world (or at least in our own bodies) and gives us a series of rituals—exercise, skin care, jade eggs—to help us supposedly counteract them.
> Today’s new religions provide their various Remixed flocks with these four elements: meaning, purpose, community, and ritual.
> progressive civil religion of social justice activism sees ultimate reality as a story about continued power and oppression.
> authenticity: the idea that one’s actions are in harmony with one’s emotions.

> 1 the development of remix and intuitional religion. Defs And purpose of religion.  -s
> “Liberals abhor the smugness, the self-righteousness, the absolute certainty, the judgmentalism, the lovelessness of a narrow, dogmatic faith.” Meanwhile, conservatives “scorn the fuzzies, the marshmallow convictions, the inclusiveness that makes membership meaningless—the ‘anything goes’ attitude that views even Scripture as relative.”4
> Freemasonry, which was devoted to supplementing Enlightenment ideals of rationalism and humanism with religious-style ritualism,
> For the Transcendentalists, the self and society were necessarily at odds.
> New York City’s Interchurch Center,
> Durkheim’s “collective effervescence”: a group coalescing and affirming its identity around a beloved totem.
> Forum moderators often served as the online equivalent of village elders, keeping the peace within communities and adjudicating disputes.
> participatory culture
> Stories now exist not to teach us or inform us, but to serve us.
> Why force our beliefs into a narrow category of organized religion, with its doctrines and creeds, when we can cobble together a metaphysical system that demands of us no moral, ethical, spiritual, or aesthetic compromises?
> We’re used to getting exactly the stories and the communities we want, on demand,
> Seventy-odd years ago, the major cultural and spiritual project of America—funneled through midcentury mainline Protestantism—was liberal ecumenism: the utopian vision of varied, disparate traditions and denominations coming together to seek common ground and effect widespread change. Today, that project feels hopelessly obsolete.
> We are all our own individual religions. And the cultural myths and narratives we tell, customize, and individualize—a new kind of fan fiction—continue to shape the world around us.
> Jefferson created what might be considered the first American fan fiction: The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth.64 Now, we’re all doing the same thing.
> 4 fandom, precipatory culture, and tribes. -s
> If fandom provided us with a structure for today’s Remixed religious culture, wellness provides its implicit theology.
> WW (which now stands, according to the [WeightWaters] company, for “wellness that works”)
> wellness culture, in other words, wasn’t formed in a vacuum. Its implicit ideology—that the universe is conspiring to keep the success you deserve from you until you reach out and take
> has become a marketing slogan, one designed to lend legitimacy to behavior that might, in other moral systems, be considered merely selfish.
> Getting your toes done (as Dame suggested) may not be the most practical avenue of #resistance. But it’s an acknowledgment that our physical and emotional selves may be all we feel we can rely on. For all its claims to positivity, wellness culture is, at its core, nihilistic.
> Contemporary Remixed witchcraft is less about the specifics of belief than it is about the creation of a sense of existential purpose revolving around cultural resistance.
> Like wellness culture, New Age philosophy promoted radical self-reliance
> In New Age culture, as in its nineteenth-century antecedents, knowledge and intellect took a back seat to emotion and feeling, which represented the uncontaminated knowledge of the true self.
> “Witchcraft has always been a religion of poetry, not theology. The myths, legends, and teachings are recognized as metaphors for ‘That-Which-Cannot-Be-Told,’
> The kinky social networking website FetLife... -f
> If wellness culture centers the perfectibility of the body as the locus of personal spiritual growth, then sexual utopianism takes that corporeality to its logical conclusion. If the divine is to be found not just within ourselves but in the specifically physical experience of our embodied selves, why shouldn’t sexuality be the place for us to access not just pleasure but meaning and purpose?

> They reject what they decry as the moral relativism and individualism of contemporary American culture, but they believe in nothing more transcendent than biological urges.
> But 12 Rules for Life is less innovative than it is nostalgic. The implicit ideology of the book is that in the modern age—and in particular in secular, feminist, identity-politics-motivated culture—humans have lost touch with the primary dichotomies that structure existence: the careful balance between (masculine) order and (feminine) chaos.
> “We must each adopt as much responsibility as possible for individual life, society, and the world,” Peterson writes.
> Central to this responsibility is an acceptance of, in Peterson’s argument, certain fundamental biological and evolutionary realities,

> There were two classes of solitaries: anchorites (restricted to a place), and hermits (not restricted. -- Some hermits were caretakers, such as lightkeepers, keepers of highway and bridges, or shrines, or special chaplains (minister to strangers and the poor, and to pray for the people). Many saw them as a sort of prophet or seer. -- Solitaries had 'rules of life', used moreso as 'friendly councel' (p. 89). -- Hermits 'signed a deed of profession, made a vow, and received a charge as to his future manner of living...' (p. 86) -- Solitiaries were typically held to a vegetarian diet -- 'In the realm of romance, the solitary is a teacher, expounder of visions, confessor, counsellor, healer, and host.' (p. 147). -s
> Withdrawal from the world was not at first encouraged by the Christian religion. -p. 13 -q
> Paul of Egypt -- called 'the first hermit'... -p. 13 -q
> It is true that their primary objective in retiring into solitude was the cultivation of the soul, but in doing so they became living witnesses to the reality of the spiritual world. -p. 13 q
> They upheld a lofty and austere moral ideal in the face of self-indulgence, and their manner of llfe was a silent rebuke to rudeness, and excercised a chastening influence in an age of violence. -p. 13 -q
> There were, indeed, two distinct classes of solitaries: the anchorite, enclosed within four walls, and the hermit, who went out of his cell and mingled with his fellow-man. -p. j13 -q
> In some cases anchorites devoted their quiet hours to study, and placed their literary or artistic powers at the service of others. -p. 14 -q

> 5 HIGHWAY AND BRIDGES HERMITS: Hugh Garth -- Langland -- John le Marechal -- Adam de Whenby
> Some unscrupulous people "took the habit for the sake of an idle life, preferring alms to wages. -61 -q
> The vow of Richard Ludlow... he undertook to have the minister's profession in worship and reverence, to live to his life's end in temperance, soberness, and chastity, to eschew all open spectacles, common scot=ales, tavers, and other suspect places of sin; to hear Mass, pray, and fast; and lastly, he undertook that whatever he should recieve by the way of charity, he would expend truly, without deceit, upon the mending of the bridge and common ways of the town, reserving only sufficent to support himself. -62 -q
> 6 TOWN HERMITS: Thomas de Byreford, Alan Chauns, John "the hermit" (John le Megre?)
> Town-hermits often undertook definite employment [like caretakers of bridges and roads, gates, lepers, or a special chaplain (minister to strangers and the poor, and to pray for the people)]. -p. 71 -q
> 7 ANCHORITES: Wulfric, Lauretta, Katherine of Ledbury, -s
> The anchorite differed from the hermit in that he lived in stricter seclusion, and was not free to wander at will. -p. 73 -q

> The Order of St. Paul the First Hermit -p. 86 -f

> The recluse's Rule of Life consisted of friendly councel rather than rigid regulation. -p. 9 -q

> Flesh was rarely tasted by the hermit. -p. 102 -q
> The recluse lived on simple foods, chiefly vegetarian. -p. 104 -q
> No man felt himself a hermit until he had assumed some distinctive dress. -p. 105 -q

> In early days it was customary for the cell to become the tomb of its tenant, whether hermit or anchorite. -p. 113 -q
> X TRIAL AND TEMPTATION
> To learn to suffer, and to suffer well, was one of the chief ambitions of the anchoress. -p. 124 -q
> XII HUMAN INTERCOURSE: A. Companionship in the cell -- B. Intercourse with the world -- C. Constancy of Abode
> The 'solitary' was not condemned to a self-centered and self-sufficing life of utter separation and silence. Companionship was permitted, even  encouraged, on the ground that to live entirely apart from human converse was positively dangerous to the soul... The rules therefore impressed the avisability of fellowship with another of like mind and purpose. -p. 128 -q
> Guthlac formed a group of recluses who were in touch with one another. -p. 128 -q
> Nor did the enclosed person necessarily live alone. Wulfric, for example, seems to have the company of Brichtic (p. 74). Richard de Coupe of Swepestone, priest, and Geoffrey Richard, layman, dwelt together in London in the churchyard of St. Lawrence, Jewry (1367). -p. 130 -q
> Recluses had to avoid the pettiness, suspician, and ill-temper which a narrow life might foster... A spirit of unity was to be cultivated: 'Let your dear faces be always turned to each other with kind affection, a cheerful countenance, adn gentle courtesy'. [Ancren Riwle] -p. 131 -q
> It was customary for the enclosed person to have servants. -p. 131 -q

> ... but an anchoress ought to give her thoughts to God only. -Ancren Riwle. -p. 136 -q
> XII PROPHETS AND CONSELLORS
> The hermits and achorites of England occupied an independent position somewhat akin to that of the Hebrew seer... follower of Elijah and John the Baptist. It was therefore hsi vocation to read the signs of the times, to declare, to preach, and, it may be, to predict. -p. 146 -q
> In the realm of romance, the solitary is a teacher, expounder of visions, confessor, counsellor, healer, and host. -p. 147 -q
> Claiming to know the Divine will by special revelation, the recluse often exercised an important influence both in public and private affairs. -p. 155 -q
> XII LITERARY RECLUSES (St. Jerome, Gildas, historian, Cuthbert, Billfrith, Plegmund, Dunstan, Guy (Wido), Wechelen, Godric of Finchale, Simon Stock, hymn-writer, Thomas Scrope, historian, Geoffrey, grammarian, George (or Gregory) Ripley, alchemist, Margery Kemp and Julian, mystics, Richard Rolle, composer of poetry and prose, Symon, compiler of a manual of meditations ("The Fruyte of Redempcyon")
> The solitary, therefore, ought to be learned, not one who needs to be taught; also he aught to be wise and learned in the Divine law, that he may know whnce he may bring forth things new and old. -Grimlaic, Regula Solitariorum (9th c.) -p. 167 -q
> There is a tradition that a a British recluse (Eremita Brytannus), living in the time of Ina, King of Wesses, collected the history of his country, and expecially the deeds of King Arthur. -p. 167 -q
> The eleventh-century chronicler, Osbern, visited [Dunstan's] cell or den, which he describes as being more like a tomb than a human habitation. It seems incredible that it measured only 5 feed by 2 1/2 feet. Tn this narrow dwelling the gifted young solitary studied the Scriptures, transcribed and illimited manuscripts, and even, so it said, practiced various arts, such as casting bells and making organs. -p. 169 -q
> The solitary now belongs to a bygone age... Recluses were swept away by the flood which carried off all that was in any way connected with monasticism... They were not a class composed wholly of eccentric and fanatical, or selfish and morbid persons who shirked the duties of life. They were often men and women of strong and saintly character whose life commanded respect and won gratitude from their fellow-man, who recoognized them as workers. At it's best, the contemplative life was a career and a noble one. -p. 191-2. -q

> This book presents a curriculum for information literacy. -s
> People need the skills and values to enable them not just to access information but to use it to make informed judgements and choices, to make their voices heard and make a difference. Librarians have recognized this for many years and call these skills and values ‘information literacy’. -q
> Information-literate people... are judicious citizens who can use information to transform their circumstances, create new knowledge and reach their full potential. -q
> Yet in a world awash with information and knowledge, young people appear increasingly unable to carry out independent research, reluctant to argue and to challenge big ideas and to take risks to discover new knowledge. Instead they readily copy and paste ideas rather than read and critique them. -q
> If librarians are not needed to manage books, perhaps they canevolve into a new role as information literacy experts? -q  I think this exaggerates the situation. Librarians continue to manage books (and other information packets), digital or otherwise. -r
> Libraries have a fundamental role in providing access to information and knowledge, to enable it to be used and communicated to others. In essence, libraries... facilitate learning. Learning enables research and research brings about transformation and progress. -q
> . While librarians may no longer be gatekeepers of knowledge, they can be valuable trusted guides and through information literacy initiatives they can help learners become autonomous and able to make their own informed judgements. -q
> ... we work towards the shared ambition of developing autonomous, lifelong learners who are able to use information effectively in their academic studies and in their personal and professional lives. -q
> The term ‘information literacy’ was first used almost 40 years ago and was coined by Paul Zurkowski, a US librarian (Zurkowski, 1974). -q
> Information literacy empowers people in all walks of life to seek, evaluate, use and create information effectively to achieve their personal, social, occupational and educational goals. It is a basic human right in a digital world and promotes social inclusion in all nations. -q
UNESCO (2005) 
> Information literacy is a continuum of skills, behaviours, approaches and values that it is so deeply entwined with the use of information as to be a fundamental part of learning, scholarship and research. It is the defining characteristics of the discerning scholar, the informed and judicious citizen and the autonomous learner. -q

Emerging in the 13th Century, Mali declined in the 15th Century and came int o an end 100 years later.

> To be sure, the African slave trade was not altogether a European innovation. Some form of slavery had existed in Africa, among Africans, for centuries. Prisoners of war and convicted criminals... African chiefs and kings sold their slaves to Europeans just as they always sold them to one another... if the African slave trade had never advanced byond the immediate domestic needs of Africa and Europe, it might never have gotten out of hand. As things turned out, however, only nine years after Columbus' first trip across the Atlantic the Spanish throne issued a proclamation legalizing the import of slaves to its colonies in the Americas. -p. 106 -q

> Accounts of religion in Benin are vague, but the Bini apparently believed in a ssupreme god who created and ruled the earth... they worshiped numerous lesser gods... The human sacrifices were offered not to the gods, but to the devil, whom the Bini blamed for all their misfortunes. -p. 112 -q
> But by 1897 the disintegration was complete; that year a British force found the city of Benin all buy deserted and littered with bodies of sacrificial victims. -p. 118 -q 
> For the individual African, however, religion did nto end with prayer to the gods and respect for ancestors. The supernatural made itself felt at a third level: in sorcery and witchcraft. p. 127 -q
> Priestess of the Python: She asks questions, she sgoes to the silver-gray roots of the cottonwoood tree, picks up a snake, palces it before the alter, and uses it as an oracle. -p. 121 -f
> Religion, in fact, can be said to have been the regulating force in all ey said and did. -p. 122 -q

> Orishanula: lesser god. Is said to have done the actual work of creating the Earth rather than Olodumare. -p. 124 -f
> Their [priests and priestess'] authority came partly from a broad knowledge of herbal medicine, plus psychological insight and an intimate undrstanding of local circumstances... it also came from the general belief in the priest's or priestess' power to mediate with the spirit world. -p. 125 -q
> In Ashanti, for example, the shrine priest was called an okomfo. -p. 125 -q
> In Ashanti, a novice studied for three years, during which time he was said to be 'married' to the god. The first year he learned the ceremmonial uses of herbs - which leaves to rub on his ankles to strengthen them for dancing; which to rub on his eyes so that he could "see his god daily"; which to take in order to arouse the spirit of possession. During the second year he learned the laws and taboos of the god. He was told never to drink intoxicating liquors, never to gossip, never to quarrel or fight, never to call upon his god to kill anyone, never to attend the chief's court unless invited, never to go at night to join other young men. In addition, he was always to salute his elders by bending his right knee and touching the ground with his right hand. Finally, in his last year, the priest-to-be learned the arts of divination and incantation and the proper forms of addressing his god. -p. 126 -q
> Like other such societies, the Poro was essentially religious. But the broad democracy of its membership, backed by the authority of ancestral sanctions, gave it a srong role in the practical aspects of community life as well. The Poro existed to interpret the will of ancesters, but it also arranged public festivals, settled secular disputes and set market prices for everything from yams to gold. Religion and politics thus went hand in hand. -p. 127 -q
> There was good magic and bad; the former could be helpful, even benevolent, the latter disasterous, especially when it was the deliberate work of sorcers. But evil could also come from unpremeditated work of witches. -p. 127 -q
> ... Africans turned to a specialist in magic, commonly called the witch doctor. -p. 127 -q
> He [the witch-doctor] was often able to settle disputes between rivals that may have led to voilence, and his knowledge of the medicinal value of herbs frequently led him to prescribe remedies that actually cured. Also, through his intimate knowledge of the lives of the people of in his community, and of human nature in general, it was not unusual for him to fuction as a sort of prescientist psychologist -p. 128 -q
> For Africans the goal in life was to live as one's fathers had lived. It might not be progress, but it was stability. -p. 128 -q

> But they do have hungry grandchildren, and the more time that a Hadza grandmother spends foraging for food, the faaster her grandchildren gain weight as a result. -p. 218 -q
> Hence the minds of older people are the society's encyclopedias and libraries... Older people know the tribe's myths and songs, who is related to whom, who did what to whom and when, the names and habits and uses of hundreds of species of local plants and animals, and where to go to find food when conditions are poor. Hence caring for older peple becomes a matter of life or death, just as caring for one's hydrographic charts is a matter of life or death for modern boat captains. -p. 219 -q

> I'm not aware of hermits who devised their own religion from scratch, went off into the desert to live alone, and refused food offerings and discouraged visitors. If someone should show me such a hermit, I would define him as a non-religious hermit or else a misanthrope [hater of humankind], while others might consider him to be a typical religious hermit except forfailing the test of sociality. -p. 330 -q

> Our brain's ability to discover such casual explanations is the major reason for our success as a species... Thus, one form in wich our search for casual explanations overgeneralizes and leads straightforwardly to what today we would term supernatural beliefs consists of attributing agency to plants and non-living things. -p. 337 -q

> The non-communicable diseases that kill most First World citizens today - diabetes, hypertennsion, stroke, heart attaks, atherosclerosis, cardiovascular diseases in general, and cancers - were rare or unknown among traditional New Guineans living in rural areas... the diseases that killed them, along with accidents and interpersonal violence, were ones that have now been largely eliminated as causes of death in the First World: gastrointestinalinfections producing diarrhea, respiratory infections, malaria, parasites, malnutricion, and secondary conditions preying on people weakened by those primary conditions. -p. 411 -q

> A great book begins with an idea; a great life, with a determination. -p. 2 -q
> That book or that person who can give me an idea or a new slant on an old idea is my friend. -p. 3 -q
> No mater how much I admire our schools, I know that no university exists that can provide an education; what a university can provide is an outline, to give the learner a direction and guidance. The rest one has to do for oneself. -p. 3 -q
> If I were asked what education should give, I would say it should offer breadth of view, ease of understanding, tolerance for others, and a background from which the mind can explore in any direction. -p. 3 -q
> Historical novels are, without question, the best way of teaching history, for they offer the human stories behind the events and leave the reader with a desire to know more. -p. 7 -q

> It is often said that one has but one life to live, but that is nonsense. For one who reads, there is no limit to the number of lives that may be lived... -p. 18 -q

> The difficulty was that few people know what it means to be absolutely alone. Even fewer people know what silence is. Our lives are filled with the comming and going of poeple and vehicles, so much so that our senses scarely notice the sounds. They have become a background to our living, all our thinking, absorved subconsciously. -p. 42 -q

Very young children will often learn a difficult subject easily unless someone tells them it is 'hard'. To me it also seems obvious that a child should be taught some methods of reasoning, methods of scientific investigation. Children have an innate feeling for logic and, given the opportunity, would learn quickly. -p. 74 -q
> We do not at present educate people to think but, rather, to have opinions, and that is something altogether different. Many of the political ideas that have disturbed the world int he past fifty years could not exist in such an atmosphere. -p. 75 -q

> That, too, was education. I learned that when I was in charge I should keep my eyes open and understand the situation before I move. And I learned i was also risky to break up teams that are used to working together. No matter what is to be gained, much is also lost. -p. 91 -q
> I was by no means a scholar, simply an interested reader with nothing to do but live and learn... -p. 103 -q
> There is an effort now to preserve everything by mechanical means, but of what use will they be to a man who has no power? No means of reproducing the sounds or the words? A book can be carried away and read at leasure. It needs nothing but an eye, a brain, and the ability to read. -p. 104 -q

> The western pioneers were select people, selected by themselves. They chose to break the mold, to leave all they knew behind and venture into a new country, wiith new problems, new standards. Each one was expected to stand on his own feet. He was moving of his own volition, on his own supprot system. Nobody was paying his way or showing him the way; nobody had told him to go, or where to go. He simply packed what goods he could carry and headed west, looking for what chance might offer. -p. 145 -q

> Books are precious things, but mmore than that, they are the strong backbone of civilization. They are the thread upon which it all hangs, and they can save us when all else is lost. -p. 146 -q

> One of the enduring findings of modern scholarship on the New Testament and early Christianity over the past two centuries is that the followers of Jesus, during his life, understood him to be human through and through, not God. People saw Jesus as a teacher, rabbi, and even a prophet. Some people thought of him as the (very human) messiah. -p. 45 -q
> How did an apocalyptic prophet from the backwaters of rural Galilee, crucified for crimes against the state, come to be thought of as equal to the One God Almight, maker of all things How did Jesus - in the minds and hearts of his later followers - come to be God? -p. 45 -q
> Its like what some Episcopalians say about themselves today: get four in a room and you'll find five opinions. So too with ancient Jews. -p. 51 -q
> HENOTHEISM, the view that, while many gods exists, one will 'believe' in only one. -p. 53 -f
> Stoics believed that Logos - reason - was a divine element that infused all of existance... as the mind is to the body, so the Logos is to the world. -p. 73-5 -q
> METHODS: 1) Criterion of independent attestation 2) Criterion of dissimilarity (if a tradition is dissimiliar to what early Christians woudl have to say about Jesus, it is more likely to be historically accurate) 3) Criterion of contextual credibility. -p. 94-8 -f
> MESSIAH, one who is annointed... chosed and specially honored by God. -p. 113 -f
> He [Jesus] thought he was a prophet predicting the end of the current evil age and the future king of Israel in the age to come. -p. 124 -q
> Almost certainly the divine self-claims [of Jesus] in John are not historical. -p. 125 -q
> What we can know with relative certainty about Jesus is that his public ministry and proclamation were not focused on his divinity... They were about God. And about the kingdom that God was going to bring... He believed and taught that he was the future king of the coming kingdom of God, the messiah of God yet to be revealed. -p. 128 -q
> What was it that made Jesus so special?... it was not his message... what made Jesus different from all the others... was the claim that he had been raised from the dead. -p. 131 -q
> The resurrection for Paul is not a spiritual matter unrelated to the body, as it was for some of his opponents. -p. 137 -q
> A standard confession, or creed, quoted: Cor. 15:3-8; Romans 1:3-4; by Luke: Acts 13:32-33, 2:36. -f
> pre-Pauline/pre-literary formulations: 1) fact 2) theological interpretation 3) statement 3) proof (by means of physical evidence). -p. 138-40 -f
> The 'third day' resurrection story is thought to fulfil Hos. 6:2. Ehrman connects it with Matt. 12:39-41 ('the sign of Jonah'), and Jonah 2, as Jonah was in the belly of the fish for three days/nights. -p. 141 -f
> ... Daniel Smith, to suggest that these two sets of traditions - the empty tomb and the appearances of Jesus after his death - probably originated independantly of one another and were put together as a single tradiition only later- for example, in the Gospels of Matthew and Luke. -p. 143 -q
> ... the idea that Jesus rose on the 'third day' was originally a theological construct, not a historical piece of information. -p. 175 -q
> What is certain is that the earliest followers of Jesus believed that Jesus had come back to life, in the body, and that this was a body that had real bodily characteristics [because] some of Jesus's followers had visions of him after he had been crucified. -p. 183 -q
> ... the disciple's belief in the resurrection was based on visionary experiences. I should stress that it was visions, and nothing else, that lead the first disciples to believe in the resurrection. -p. 184 -q
> Contradistinction: Distinction made by contrasting the different qualities of two things #wotd -p. 185 -f
> In Jesus's view, the dead would be raised bodily to face judgement, either to be rewarded if they had sided with God or to be punished if they had aligned themselves with forces of evil. This afterlife in the kingdom would entail a bodily resurrection. -p. 185 -q
> ... visions appear to occur with particular frequency among those who are experiencing bereavement or religious awe and expectation. -p. 195 -q
> Such visions are more commonly experienced when a person has a sence of guilt over some aspect of his or her relationship with the one who has died. -p. 195 -q
> I should stress that the Guggenheims are not trained in psychology or in other fields relevant to the scientific study of visions; therefore, their analysis of their data is not useful for scholarly purposes. -p. 196 -q
> It appears that people who are physically or emotionally exhausted are more likely to have an After-Death Communication. -p. 196 -q
> As apocalyptic Jews, the disciples believed that the afterlife entailed a resurrection of the dead. When they experienced Jesus after he had died, they naturally understood his new life in the light of their own deeply held convictions. He had been bodily raised from the dead. -p. 197 -q
> ... Paul hold to an incarnation [high, v.s. exaltation, i.e. 'low'] Christology. That, in no small measure, is because Paul understood Christ to be an angel who became a human [Gal. 4:14]. -p. 252 -q
> Semitism: the way of righteousness, v.s. the right way; Holy Spirit; v.s. Spirit of holiness. -p. 233 -f
> ... Romans 1:3-4. It appears to be the earliest form of Christian belief: that God exalted Jesus to be his Son by raising him from the dead. -p. 266 -q
> The oldest Christology of all may be found in the preliterary traditions in Paul and the book of Acts, but it is not the view present in any of the Gospels. Instead... the oldest Gospel, Mark, seems to assume that it was at his baptism that jesus became the Son of God; the next Gospels, Matthew and Luke, indicate that Jesus became the Son of god when he was born; and the last Gospel, John, presents Jesus as the Son of God before creation.... [however] the reality is... view of Jesus did not develop along a straight line... -p. 236-7 -q
> Luke is fond of incorporating a variety of prelitary traditions that he had heard, even if they differ from his own view. -p. 240 -q

> MARCION, m, 2nd c., Roman. -- Founder of MARCIONITES, a docetist docrine. -p. 300 -f
> The orthodox position, as we will see, claimed that both sides of this dispute were right in what they affirmed and wrong in what they denied. -p. 302 -q
> ... Christian Gnostics maintained that salvation came not through faith in the death and resurrection of jesus, but through proper 'knowledge' of the secrets Christ revealed to his followers. -p. 303 -q
> PRECOCIOUS: appearing or developing early. #wotd -p. 315 -f
> SYSTEMATIC THOLOGY: 'methodical attempt to deal with the major theological views of the church. -p. 316 -q 
> And even though they said the traditional Christian Creeds as part of their worship services, many of these people did not believe what they said - as I learned from talking with them. -p. 323 -q
> 'We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ' Again, why say there is one of him... Here, too, it is because Gnostic Christians were sayign that Christ was several beings, or at least two: a divine being and a human being who were only temporarily united. -p. 324 -q
> ... liberal and open churches... -p. 325 -q
> For me... not being able to say the (rest of the) creed... prevents me from joinng such congregations. ... event clergy - often tell me that this should not be an obsticle. A lot of them don't believe it either! At least not in any literal way. -p. 325 -q
> For the church leaders who formulated them, not only the very basic literal meaning of these statements mattered (God exists; Christ is his Son; he was God; but he became a human; he died for others and rose from the dead; etc.); the deeper nuances mattered as well - every word was to be taken as literally true and important, and contrary statements were to be rejected as both heretical and dangerous. -p. 326 -q
> With respect to Christology... it was concluded that Christ was a sepaarate being from God the Father, who had always existed alongside God, whowas equal with God and always had beenequal with God, who became a human, not in part, but completely, while not abandoning his status and power as God. -p.326 -q
> In the end, the orthodox settled for the paradox of the Trinity: there are three persons, all of whom are God, but there is only one God. One God, manifest in three persons, who are distinct in number but united in essence. -p. 329 -q
> Christianity was far more focused on 'theological truth' than traditional Greek or Roman religions and palced greater emphasis on 'sacrificial practice'. -p. 348 -q
> If Constantine did not much like the controversy of his own day, he would have despised what was to come. -p. 351 -q

>Reconstruction has conventionally been dated from the war’s end in 1865 to 1877,
>the process by which the United States tried to come to terms with the momentous results of the Civil War,
>The Tragic Era
>Whether the courts should base decisions on “originalism” is a political, not a historical, question.
>Ambiguity creates possibilities.
>Principles which we all thought to have been firmly and permanently settled,” Frederick Douglass observed, were “boldly assaulted and overthrown.”
>The historian Linda Colley has observed that written constitutions often function as “weapons of control” rather than “documents of liberation and rights.”
>constitution should not be construed as denying to any citizens the privileges and immunities to which they were entitled,
>As Alexis de Tocqueville observed, a passion for equality animated American democracy. But the concept of equality before the law—something enjoyed by all persons regardless of social status—barely existed before the Civil War.
>pursuit of happiness (often understood as the right to enjoy the fruits of one’s own labor and rise in the social scale).
>Before Reconstruction the federal government played almost no role in defining or protecting Americans’ rights.
>Colored Convention” movement,
>Frederick Douglass, after several years of adhering to the Garrisonian position, changed his mind and declared the Constitution “a glorious liberty document.” “I am for strict construction,” he declared, and the word “slavery” could not be found in the Constitution’s text. Nor did it contain language allowing for “discrimination in favor of, or against, any class of people.”
>Free Soil party
>barring slavery’s expansion into the territories, the issue that brought on the Civil War—
>And the abolitionist critique of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, which provided that the status of an accused runaway would be determined by a federal commissioner, not a jury, and that the alleged fugitive could not testify in his or her own behalf, led to the elevation of “due process of law” as essential to equitable judicial proceedings.
>made the federal government for the first time what Sumner called “the custodian of freedom.”
>During the conflict, Lincoln felt obligated to stretch constitutional authority to its limits and beyond.
>Roughly 150 amendments to resolve the secession crisis were proposed during the winter of 1860–61.
>He did not share the abolitionists’ commitment to ending slavery immediately nor their belief that free
>blacks and emancipated slaves should become equal members of American society.
>Women’s Loyal National League, founded in 1863. For the time being women activists suspended the movement for woman suffrage to press for an end to slavery, the route, they believed, to blacks and white women obtaining their “rights and privileges as free and equal citizens of a common republic.”
>Kentucky also refused. The place of Lincoln’s birth would have the distinction of being the only state to reject the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments. It finally decided to ratify them in 1976.
>Along with the right to “personal liberty,” declared another, the “right of a husband to his wife” and of a “father to his child” comprised the “three great fundamental natural rights of human society.” The amendment was intended to restore these rights, not undermine them.42
>For decades, those who would later become Radical Republicans had defended the unpopular causes of black suffrage and equal citizenship.
>Another option was to base representation on voters, not total population, as Stevens had proposed.
>“the wildest fancy of a distempered brain”
>Congressman Giles Hotchkiss of New York,
>THE LAST-MINUTE ADDITION of a definition of American citizenship constitutionalized the principle that virtually every person born in the country is a citizen, regardless of race, national origin, or the political affiliation or legal status of one’s parents. Today, the United States stands almost alone among industrialized nations in this;
>birthright citizenship, with which the Fourteenth Amendment begins, remains an eloquent statement about the nature of American society,
>The first sentence of the Fourteenth Amendment also marked a radical change in the role of black women within American society. As slaves, they gave birth to property; now their children were citizens of the nation, rather than economic assets of white southerners.
>“Due process” suggests procedural fairness, not substantive rights.
>The Declaration of Independence contained the stirring words “all men are created equal,” a radical pronouncement at a time when most countries were ruled by monarchs and hereditary aristocrats.
>The Fourteenth Amendment for the first time elevates equality to a constitutional right of all Americans. It makes the Constitution a vehicle through which aggrieved groups and individuals who believe that they are being denied equality can take their claims to court.
>“A true republic,” said William Windom, a Republican congressman from Minnesota, “rests upon the absolute equality of rights of the whole people, high and low, rich and poor, white and black.”
>In the context of the violence sweeping the postwar South, the word “protection” in the Fourteenth Amendment conjured up not simply unequal laws but personal safety.
>WOTD: raison d’être. -f
>Democratic candidate for vice president, Francis Preston Blair Jr.,
>Horatio Seymour, the presidential candidate,
>State control of voting qualifications, claimed Senator Oliver P. Morton of Indiana, was a relic of state sovereignty, the frame of mind that had produced secession.
>“The whole fallacy,” said Morton, “lies in denying our nationality. I assert that we are one people and not thirty-seven different peoples; that we are one nation, and as such we have provided for ourselves a national Constitution.”
>John A. Bingham, the key author of the Fourteenth Amendment,
>The eleventh former Confederate state, Tennessee, rejected the amendment in 1869; it would ratify it in 1997.
>“crack brained harlequin and semi-lunatic,”
>Nonetheless, over time, the Court played a crucial role in the long retreat from the ideals of Reconstruction.
>Increasingly, the Court construed the Fourteenth Amendment as a vehicle for protecting corporate rights rather than those of the former slaves, striking down state regulations of working conditions and railroad rates on the grounds that they violated “freedom of contract” protected under the Due Process Clause.
>Edward D. White,
>breakdown of the Republican consensus in support of Reconstruction in the 1870s and the retreat that accelerated in the following decades.
>privileges or immunities
>involved far more significant rights than Miller mentioned. For John A. Bingham, as noted in Chapter Two, they comprised those enumerated in the Bill of Rights
>railroad companies, hotel keepers, and “managers of places of public amusement” should be considered “agents or instrumentalities of the state,” as they were licensed and performed a public service.
>“It seems . . . that now, as long ago,” wrote the Harrisburg Telegraph, “freedom cannot be made safe in the United States as long as we have a Supreme Court.”
>culminating in decisions of the Warren Court during the Second Reconstruction of the 1950s and 1960s,
>The state, for example, required a photo ID to vote and then closed driver’s license offices—where such documents can be obtained—in counties with the highest percentage of blacks in the population.
>The elevation of the Commerce Clause into a “charter of human rights,” a way of compensating for the Supreme Court’s cramped view of the Reconstruction amendments, has made the judiciary look ridiculous.

> When thirty-seven cents of every United States tax dollar is spent on past and current warfare, while only two cents of every tax dollar is spent on diplomacy, international assistance, and war prevention, one could reasonably conclude the United States is suffering from a collective psychosis. -p. 61 -q
> By spiritual, I mean not only one's orientation to a Divine Being but also one's recognition of and appreciation for the inherent worth of their follow humans. -p. 61 -q
> For the seeds of violence are rooted in our desire to change and manipulate another, inevitably through coercion, which first violates the will and spirit of another, then does violence to his or her body. -p. 62 -q
> There are varying reasons for this [continued violence in spite of working for peace], chief among them humanity's tendency to believe certain types of agression will end all violence, which is magical thinking and has never proven to be the case. -p. 62 -q
> Long before the first punch is thrown or the first gun is fired comes the effort to compel another to do our bidding... a form of voilence meant to violate another's will or conscience -p. 65, 67 -q
> We have created a world designed to punish or marginalize persons who question or reject our culture's assumptions and values. p. 65 -q
> ... the ultimate powerless of coercion. Once our deepest fears have been met and overcome, we enjoy a power and a freedom we have not known before. Too often we have been silenced or cowed by fear fears of retrobution. But when we act, we discover our fears were overblown, and we are no longer held hostage by treats of retaliation. It is then we can begin living life powerfully and purposefully, living the prophetic lives God has called us to live... a prophetic witness against evil. -p. 66 -q
> This might be the greatest temptation for those of us who are religious: the tendency to confuse our personal hopes for God's will... p. 67-8 -q
> Hatred does not have to be based on logic or actual circumstances. In fact, it usually isn't. We only have to believe someone poses a treat to us to justify his or her demise. -p. 69 -q
> ...coercion is the start of violence... -p. 69 -q
> This shared Divine Presence brings us together, then binds us together, enabling us to care for one another. The alternative is tribalism and its jealous gods, whereby distinctions are forever drawn, suspiciouss raised, and boundaries guarded. This has been our past. It cannot be our future. -p. 75 -q
> But we have armed ourselves far beyond the actual threat posed by others, chiefly because we habe been persuaded the dangers we face is so significant we have no choice but to dedicate most of our resources to war and the preparation for it. -p. 79 -q
> Religion, when grounded in an ethos of grace, forgiveness, and reconciliation, can be a powerful tool in the struggle for peace. -p. 83 -q
> This inward lack of trust breeds outward suspicion, generates ill will, and makes peace all the more unlikely. -p. 94 -q
> What must be healed is the hateful though, the intolerant rhetoric, the laws that demean. -p. 85 -q
> Three children in the United States died from lawn darts, which led to their ban in 1988. But 1,500 to 2,000 children under the age of seventeen are shot to death each year, and manufacture of weaponry continues unabated. -p. 90 -q
> The peace Jesus leaves us is the capacity to forgive, the potential for reconciliation, and the example for determined grace. -p. 93 -q
> Whenever the leaders of a nation use violence against their own peopel or their neighors, we must hold them criminally liable for their misdeeds, no matter their position or nationality. Violence is as contagious as any germ and to allow it to grow unchecked in one nation is to ensure it's rapid spread to others. -p. 94 -q
> Cooperation, mutual responsibility, and selflessness are essential among nations as they are among families -p. 94 -q
> I wish for them what I wish for all people: a life of peace and joy, unthreatened by hatred and discord. -p. 96 -q
> Quakers believed their credible witness to the gospel depended upon their reputation, that if they were dishonest in human affairs, they couldn't be trusted to speak truthfully about God. -p. 100 -q
> I also understood that in matters of integrety it was better to go the extra mile than to fall short, for reputations, once tarnished, are difficult to restore. -p. 102 -q
> Just as Friends valued simplicity in dress, so too was their speech unadorned. They believed flowery speech intended to impress or curry favor was inhearently dishonest, so they spok to the king as they did the commoner. -p. 105 -q
> They believed shoddy work was a sin and reflected poorly on their witness to God. -p. 106 -q
> Woolman visited the native Indians, hoping to "recieve some instruction from them.' -p. 110 -q
> But Quakers believe God and truth are synonymous, that to find one is to discover the other. p. 110 -q
> In that sense, they are not anti-sacramental, but omni-sacramental; they believe all of live can and does point to God. -p. 110 -q
> Propaganda seeks to covert the unbeliever, while truth seeks to hear them out. -p. 114 -q
> The therapist helped me understand that I was responsible for my own feelings, responsible for my choices, and responsible for my reactions to others. -p. 115 -q
> The queries are a series of self-directed questions we employ to evaluate our emotional, spiritual, and relational health... the point of the queries is simple: to encourage honest self-evaluation in light of our Quaker values and priorities. -p. 118-9 -q
> To say a person has integrity means several things. Most commonly, we mean the person is honest, that his or her word can be trusted... But there is another level of meaning that has to do with integration of our values and lifestyle... this integration is critical for inward peace. Without it, we experience a split-mindedness, a separation between who we wish to be and who we are. -p. 121 -q
> CLOSTRIDIUM BOTULINUM TOXIN: 'the most powerful and potent substances known to mankind... one teaspoon is enough to kill millions of people' -p. 131 -f

> The best clerks [of a Quaker meeting] can make all feel heard and valued, while weaving the disparate elements into a unified and motivated whole. -p. 142 -q
> Consensus helps the hard feelings that often accompany voting. -p. 142 -q
> We are slower to speak and more apt to listen and solicit the view of others. The spirit is one of cooperation, not contention. -p. 143 -q
> This was my mother's mantra, ever present through my childhood: 'What if everyone did that?' -p. 144 -q
> To be a Quaker is to always understand yourself and your actions in terms of the world. It is an invitation to reflect, not siimply react, to keep before you the question, What would the world be like if everyone did what I am doing? -p. 145 -q
> Community was the safeguard against destructive behavior and the corrective against selfishness. -p. 146 -q
> The Quaker William Penn observed that 'true religion does not draw men out of the world but enables them to live better in it and excites their endeavors to mend it.' -p. 148 -q
> I can think of no nobler and more vital work for the church to undertake than the building of healthy communities which differences are appreciated and not feared, where past truths are honored and emerging wisdom encouraged. -p. 155 -q

> ... the usual British pattern: first, say something won't happen and then, when it does, saying it's going to be a failure and then, when it's a success, desperately trying to catch up. -p. -q
> CH. 8: The Chapter BRITISH OUTSIDER IN EUROPE begins with Hain's responsibilities in Europe as a negotiator for British interests. As a pro-European, he worked to change Britain's image as hostile to Europe. While forging personal relationships, he made little progress. The events in this chapter include the negotiations and politics of the Euro, and the Gibraltar co-soverenty referrendum (that failed specacularly) -p. -s
> Ch.8: This begins with Hain as a foreign office minister. Points include dealing with other government departments, and with civil servants, advocacy for 'complementary' (alternative) medicine (also called 'integrated healthcare' in the book), his rather muted admiration of the queen and royal family (Hains' background is as a republican), unguarded remarks he made to the press about tax policy, and reflections of the state (bad state, according to Hain) of journalism, or investigative journalism. Hain seems to take great pride in actually not taking advice from the civil service, and forcing his will upon officials and departments. This is viewed as true leadership. He also shows distress when the press digs into the politics of a story rather than the story. One wonders what the press is to do. While saying that the press doesn't pay attention to serious, intelligent information and true debate. Yet when they do, Hain says they become part of the story. One also wonders what is virtuous with not listen to what is usually well-informed and cautious advice from his officials. -p. -s

> The American is the Englishman left to himself. -Alexis de Tocqueville. -p. 7 -q
> Elected parliaments, habeas corpus, free contract, equality before the law, open markets, an unrestricted press, the right to proselytize for any religion, jury trials: these things are not somehow the natural condition of an advanced socity. They are specific products of a political ideology developed in the language in which you are reading these words. -p. 10 -q
> On formal occasions, men in most countries dress as Englishmen; the rest of the time they dress, for the most part, as Americans, in jeans. -p. 10 -q
> The pamphleteer [of the principles of the Whigs before the Glorious Revolution]... lawmakers should be directly accountable through the ballot box; the executive should be controlled by the legislature; taxes should not be levied, nor laws passed, without popular consent; the individual should be free from arbitrary punishment or confiscation; decisions should be taken as closely as possible to the people they affect; power should be dispersed; no one, not even the head of state, should be above the law; property rights should be secure; disputes should be arbitrated by independent magistrates; freedom of speech, religion, and assembly should be guaranteed. There is a reason that supporters of these precepts, both in Britain and in America, called themselves 'patriots' -p. 16 -q
> ... the authors evidently confused opacity of expression with profundity of thought. -p. 29 -q

> Languages with larger vocabularies leads to greater diversity of thought. -p. 32 -f

> The day after Paul Revere's ride, April 19, 1775, the first shots were fired in what most contemporaries took to be the second English Civil War - a continuation, in many ways, of the first. No one at that stage thought of the conflict as being between two distinct nations... a war that had pitted Whig against Tory rather than American against Briton. -p. 49 -q
> To put it more cynically, 'Patriot' was the name that Whigs, on both sides of the Atlantic, gave themselves. -p. 50 -q
> The Virginian-born Lady Astor described the American War of Independance as having been fought 'by British Americans against a German King for British ideals.' -p. 52 -q
> Intellectual exchange, rather than insemination, turned out to be the surest way of passing on ideas of how to organize a society. -p. 62 -q
> English-speaking people still... talk of the 'law of the land.' Not the King's law, not God's law, but the law of the land... -p. 65 -q
> It is extremely rare to find justice, freedom, or representative givernment flourishing in any context other than a nation-state. -p. 66 -q

> What distinquishes the common law from the Roman law... The Continental legal model is deductive... Common law... does the reverse... stare decisis: previous judgements should stand analtered... Common law is thus empirical rather than conceptual... -p. 77 -q
> Characteristics of Anglo-Saxon common law: the 'law of the land' (rather than the law of god, the king, etc) -- emphasis on private ownership and free contract -- everything not expressly prohibited is legal -- the invigilation of the law is everyone's business ('The policeman is a citizen in uniform, not an agent of the state') -- need for a tribunal to determine it  (the legislature, and jury (?) ). -p. 79-80. -o
> Their chiefs [the primateve German tribes] rested  upon auctoritas (the ability to inspire), rather than potestas (the ability to compel). -p. 81 -q
> The meetings of 'wise men' (witan): 1 sovereignty and legitimacy of the regime were affirmed -- 2 Ratification of the most important decisions (large grants of land, resolution of major legal disputes) -- 3 meetings are not just frequent but regular -- 4 brought together ecclesiastical, temporal powers, and second-order landowners. -p. 83 -o
> The promises that King Edgar gave on that occasion were remarkably similar to the oens given by his descendant, Elizabeth II, 980 years later: to defend the land, uphold its laws, protect its church, and rule justly. -p. 85 -q

> The Anglophone farmer in the field used plain Saxon words for his livestock: cow, pig, sheep. But by the time these animals found their way onto his Norman master's plate, they had acquired French-derived names: beef, pork, mutton. -p. 103 -q
> James II, who also united the country against him through that particular combination of subbornness, petulance, and caprice that is the mark of a weak man. -p. 108 -q
> The idea that property represented a total right of ownership by a single person was peculiar to English-speaking peoples. -p. 129 -q
> Capitalism harnesses greed to socially productive ends. -p. 143 -q
> The English-speaking peoples entered the early modern period with all the tools that were to lift them to the global hegemony that lingers in our own day: common law, sanctity of contracat, representative government, liberty of conscience, secure property, personal freedom. -p. 145 -q
> "There is a contract and a bargain made between the King and his people, and you oath is taken: and certainly, Sir, the bod is reciprocal." -John Bradshaw -p. 152 -q
> Laudians wanted to remove the emphasis from the sermon and restore it to the communion. It was, they beleived, presumptuous for worshippers to seek to understand God. Congregations were there, rather, to adore Him, and the service should be designed to highlight the mystery of faith, with the clergyman returning to the role of mediator or intercessor. Hence the importance of beautiful surroundings, stained glass windows, candles, glorious vestments. -p. 160 -q
> Liberty, in Milton's mind, did not mean an absence of rules: this he called "License," and heartily disliked. Liberty, rather, meant the freedom that comees from the virtuous and informed excersise of independant judgement... 'Where there is much desire to learn, here of necessity will be much arguing, much writing, many opinions; for opinion in good men is but knowledge in the making.' -p. 180 -q
> ... and the official theology drifted away from Calvinism and towards an emphasis on free will (not that theology has ever mattered much to Anglicans, whose church spans a wide range of beliefs). -p. 183 -q
> In James II, it is hard to find any qualities at all. He was dull-witted, sly, bigoted, self-pitying, humorless, obstinate, and cowardly. -p. 188 -q
> The Glorious Revolution was the moment when the Anglosphere took off, developing into a small-goverment, individualist, mercantile state-system. -p. 193 -q
> Ever since the Glorious Revolution, it has been tacitly undeerstood that the British might hire and fire their kings just as they might hire and fire their MPs. -p. 193 -q
> ... we are behaving unhistorically if we judge a past generation by the moral standards of our own. -p. 201 -q
> The more you look, the more you understand the distaste that people across the Anglosphere felt for teh Stuarts... Whatever their individual qualities, the Stuarts were never seen as British. -p. 206 -q
> We saw that the origins in the First Anglosphere Civil War lay in three related arguements - over tax, religion, and the location of sovereignty. -p. 210 -q
> ... the Grand Union Flag. Known also as the Congress Flag and the Continental Colors, it had the thirteen red and white stripes as they are today, but in the top left-hand quarter, instead of stars, it showed Britain's flag, made up of St. George's Cross for England and the St. Andrew's Cross for Scotland. -p. 213 -q
> Money, religion, power. -p. 216 -q
> Some contemporaries saw these passages not as theology but as a political manifesto... -p. 221 -q
> The very title "War of Independence" is misleading, for it implies that there was an extant American nation bing rules by a different nation... -p. 228 -q
> Many Native Americans, for example, fought for the Crown, seeing it as an ally against land-hungry settlers. -p. 231 -q
> The British saw themselves as being set apart by unique institutions: a sovereigh parliament, the common law, secure property rights, an independent judiciary, armed forces that were subordinate to the civil authorities, Protestantism, and, above all, personal freedom. -p. 255 -q
> ... from at least the sevententh century, there had been two broad political tendencies in the English-Speaking world. One emphasized individualism, representative democracy, and Anglosphere exceptionalism and, for the sake of abbeviation, may be labeled Whig - though that title was not always used by its partisans. The other emphasised stability, hierarchy, and order, and might - again, sometimes anachronistically - be labeled Tory. - p. 267 -q
> Black South Africans saw Afrikaans as a language of oppression, English as a language of opportunity. -p. 281 -q
> It cannot be stressed too often: the institution [of slavery] existed in every age, in every society, on every continent. What distinguishes the English-speaking nations was not that they practiced slavery, but that they crusted it. -p. 286 -q
> On the eve of the American Civil War, there were three thousand black slave owners in the United States. -p. 287 -q
> In the settler colonies, the places with large British-descended populations that form the core Anglosphere today, indigenous peoples were eventually given an effective choice between assimilation or life on protected reservations. -p. 290 -q Hardly a choice! And reservations face great inequality. -r
> ... British habits - by which he [Lord Macaulay] meant science, modern medicine, representative government, and personal liberty... -p. 292 -q
> Congress - the party that lead India to independence and was in power for most of the succeding period - had been founded by a British liberal. -p. 293 -q
> 'As a passive resister...' -Mohandas Gandhi -p. 297 -q
> The Anglosphere is becoming a devolved, flexible, commonwealth of independent states, bounded together not by governmental institutions, but by cultural, commercial, and family links. Only now, perhaps, do we understand that such a union requires no state ties. -p. 304 -q

> Their [Anglospherists] is a union of peoples, not of governments. -p. 310 -q
> The miracles of the past three and a half centuries -- the unprecedented improvements in democracy, in longevity, in freedom, in literacy, in calorie intake, in infant survival rates, in height, in equality of opportunity -- came about largely because of the individualist market system developed in the Anglosphere. -p. 312 -q
> Agrarian society gravitated towards oligarchy; most cultures have remained stuck there ever since.
> What catalized the shift from status to contract: development of nation-states -- a strong civic socity -- Island geography -- Religious pluralism -- common law. -p. 314 -f
> The Americans were determined to take no risks, and wrote into their earliest charters guarantees against standing armies and in favor of private citizens' right to bear arms. -p. 319 -q
> The resulting thesis, titled <i>The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism</i>, argued that there was indeed such a correlation [between captialism and Protestantism], and that its cause lay in the peculiarly Protestant idea that idustry and thrift were godly virtues. Until then, Weber argued, Christians had sought to renounce worldly things: to be ascetic, to despise wealth, to overcome desire. But Puritans believed that money, honestly acquired through hard work, was a sign of divine favor. -p. 322 -q
> Societies that laud martial valor, nobility, and faith tend to be less pleasant places to live than societies that value freedom, enterprise, and privacy. -p. 327 -q
> From the first, Anglosphere's labor parties were associated with self-help and self-improvement: with brass bands, the temperance movement, workingmen's libraries. -p. 336 -q
> The proudest achievements of the Anglosphere left, down the years, have involved the dispersal of power from closed elites to the general population. -p. 336 -q
> As Edmund Burke argued, life would become impossible if we tried to think through every new situation from first principles, disregarding both our own experience and the accumulated wisdom of our people -- if, in other words, we shed all prejudice. -p. 338 -q
> As we lose siight of what the Anglosphere has achieved, we risk loosing the institutions that have served to make it what it is. -p. 343 -q
> The hillbillies of the Appalachians were so called because, in the memory of the victory of William III ("King Billy") at the Boyne, they marched every year on July 12. -p. 347 -q
> Yet I hope that I have by now convinced you that the Patriots were consciously defending a political philosophy that, at that stage in human affairs, had been expressed only in the English language; that, indeed, is why they called themselves Patriots. -p. 352 -q
> When powers shift from people to government, from the states to the center, from elected representatives to bureaucrats, all the other things follow. -p. 355 -q
> Cultural relativism feeds into hard policy. Once you reject the notion of exceptionalism as intrinsically chauvinistic, you quickly regect the institutions on which that exceptionalism rested: absolute property rights, free speech, devolved government, personal autonomy. -p. 371 -q
> He would recognize India as a staet hat met the criteria he saw as essential to civilization, namely a mechanism to change the government peacefully, a legal system that is independent of the rulers, and a conception of property rights that protects the freedom of the individual. -p. 376 -q
> You, reading these words in his language, are the heirs to a subline tradition. A tradition that gave us liberty, property, and democracy, and that raised our species to a pinnacle of wealth and happiness hitherto unimaginable. Act worthy of yourselves. -p. 377 -q

> The more eastern regions of Asia were populated by Homo erectus. 'Upright Man', who survived there for close to 2 million years, making it the most durabe human species ever. This record is unlig\kely to be broken even by our own species. It is douhtful whether Homo sapiens will still be around a thousand years fro nw, so 2 milion years is really out of our leaue. -p. 6 -q

> Women paid extra. An upright gait eqired hnarrower hips, constricted the birth canal - and this just when babies' heads where getting biger and bigger... Natural selection concsequently favoured earlier births... Human babies are helpless, dependent for many years on their edlers for sustenance, protection and education... It takes a tribe to raise a human. Evolution thus favoured those capable of forming striong social ties. In addition, since humans are born underdeveloped, they can be educated and socialized to a far greater extent than any other animal. -p. 10 -q
> One of the most common uses of early stone tools was to crack open bones in order to get to the marrow. Some researchers believe this was our original niche... This is a key to understanding our history and psychology. -p. 11 -q
> By about 300,000 years ago, Homo erectus, Neanderthals and the freathes of Homo sapiens were using fire on a daily basis... The advent of cooking enabled humans to eat more kinds of food, to devote less time to eating, and to make do with smaller teeth and shorter intestines... When humns domesticated fire, they gained control of an obedient and potentially limitless force. -p. 13 -q
> We don't know exactly where and when animals that can be classified as Homo sapien first evolved from some earlier type of humans, but most scientists agree that by 150,000 years ago, East Africa was populated by Sapins that looked just like us. -p. 14 -q
> Achaeologists have discovered the bones of Neanderthals who lived for many years with severe physical handicaps, evidence that they were cared for by their relatives. -p. 14 -q
> It turned out that 1-4 per cent of the unique human DNA of modern populations in the Middle East and Europe is Neanderthal DNA. -p. 16 -q
> Tolerance is not a Sapiens trademark. In modern times, a small ifference in skin colour, dialect or religion has been enough to prompt one group of Sapiens to set about exterminating another group. -p. 18 -q
> Perhaps this is exactly why our ancestors wiped out the Neanderthals. They were too familiar to ignore, but too different to tolerate. -p. 18 -q
> The last dwarf=like humans vanished from Flores Island about 12,000 years ago. -p. 19 -q

> Our language evolved as a way of gossiping. -p. 22 -q
> Sociological research has shown that maximum 'natural' size of a group bonded by gossip is about 150 individuals. Most people can neither intimately know, nore gossip effectively about, more than 150 human beings. -p. 17 -q
> How did Homo spiens manage to cross this critical threshold, eventually founding cities comprising tens of thousands of inhabitants and empires ruling hundreds of millions? The secret was probably the appearance of fiction. Large numbers of strangers can cooperate successfully by believing in common myths. -p. 27 -q
> Peple easily understand that 'primitives' cement their social order by believing in ghosts and spirits, and gathering each full moon to dance together around the campfire. What we fail to appreciate is that our odern institutions function on exactly the same basis. -p. 28 -q

> PUBLIUS CORNELIUS TACITUS, m, roman, 
> MARCUS TULLIUS CICERO, m, Roman, 2nd c. -Statesman and philosopher. -f
> We owe to Cicero a very moden conception of the dignitas of each individual... in short, the foundations of humanism and the liberal tradition in social and political thought. -p. 58 -q
> We must give our country 'the largest and most numerous portions of our loyalty, ability, and sagacity, leaving to us for our private use only what might be surplus to its needs.' -p. 65 -q
> The philosopher, in his retirement, can 'share the company... of the greatest minds by enjoying their discoveries and writings'... -p. 65 -q
> Cicero's conception of justice... stresses respect for life, liberty, and property... they are guaranteed and protected by the ideal constitution. they recognize and defend the dignitas, the fundamental moral worth, of each individual. -p. 67 -q
> Aistotle had catalogued the three pure types of state (monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy) and their three depraved counterparts (tyranny, oligarchy, and mob rule). He argued that each pure type tends to degenerate into its opposite... He therefore advocated a mixed consitution... -p. 67 -q
> Natural law, Cicero explains, is 'right reason in harmony with nature.' -p. 70 -q
> For cicero, duty comes under four headings (derived from the four Greek virtues, but with a decidedly Roman twist): wisdom (prudentia), justice (justitia), courage (fortitude), and temperance (temperantia). -p. 72 -q
> This idea of being true to one's own nature is very modern and un-Roman. Two millennia later, it would become Nietzsche's ultimate injunction: 'Become who you are!' -p. 74 -q
> Cicero agrees with both Hellenistic schools, however, that 'the whole aim of philosophy is to lead us to a happy life'... As such, philosophy builds character and self-sufficiency, allowing us to 'face all of ife with equanimity.' -p. 75 -q
> EPICUREANISM: founded by Epicurus, stressed 1) pleasue, not virtue, is the highest good, 'peace of mind (ataraxia) and the absence of pain above all things'. 2) 'as a natural consequence of the first point, he urged his disciples to withdraw from any political involvement in favor of a quiet life and contemplation and retirement'. -p. 75 -f
> We must free ourselves from the prison of everyday affairs and politics' - Cicero -p. 75 -q
> As Cicero told his son, 'we must decide who and what we wish to be, and what kind of life we want.' -p. 76 -q
> Wise men are 'entirely self-sufficent,' and 'nothing that there is the slightest possibility of eventually losing can be regarded as an ingredient of the happy life.' -p. 77 -q
> Cicero, as always, occupies a more balanced, middle ground [between Stocism and Epicureanism]. -p. 77 -q
> Cicero thus disputes the standard Roman idea of amicitia, friendship based on mutual services and support. -p. 78 -q
> ... 'the best education for the situations of actual life cosists of the experience we acquire from the study of serious history.' -Polybius. -p. 248
> Ever-growing riches made Rome soft; avariis 'taught men haughtiness, cruelty, to neglect the gods, to regard everything for sale.' -Sallust -p. 252. -q
> 'The historian's task is not to thrill or charm but 'to record with fidelity what actually happened and was said, however coonplace this may be.' -Polybius. -p. 248 -q
> Polybius carefully describes the elements of kingship (the consuls), aristocracy (the Senate), and democracy (the popular assembly), and the inticate relations among them. -p. 249 -q
> 'It is a special duty of history to see tht virtues are not left unrecorded, and also that fear of disgrace in posterity attends iniquitous words and actions.' A crucial part of the historan''s taks, then is to assign praise and blae, t extol where he can and condemn where he must. -p. 246 -q
> He [Livy] writes of 'good citizens and noble deeds' and celebrates the constellation of virtues - patriotism, courage, loyalty, self-sacrifice, piety, and austerity - that was the foundation of Rome's greatness. -p. 254 -q
> AGRICOLA, m, Roman, 1st c. Served as governor of Britain, following consulship in 77. -p. 257 -q
> Integrity is dangerous in an absolutist state... at best, Tacitus suggests, one can serve the state competently, nurture a quiet conscience, and bide one's time. -p. 265 -q
> EPICTETUS, m, Roman, 1st c. -- Author of _Discourses_. -f
> The central tenant of Epictetus's philosphy is that we must distinquish between those things within our control and those outside of our control. Within our control are our values, desires, and volitions. Outside of our control all those things that men lust after in this life but that depend on chance and circumstance. The stoic finds his resources and his happiness within himself and directs his wishes accordingly. With regard to everything else, he says with Socrates, 'If god so pleases, so be it.' -p. 272 -q
> ... Epictetus, who argued that we can never be free until we learn to limit our desires to the sphere of matters within our control... -p. 272 -q
> Marcus recognized that the greatest enemy of each of us is within and that our constant daily battle is to vanquish vain disires and forlorn hopes in order to achieve peace and tranquility and a new form of freedom and joy is accepting divine providence and serving our fellow men. -p. 272 -q
> ARRIAN, m, Roman, 1st c. -- Historian, Consul, military commander. Author of _Anabasis_ of Alexander. -p. 273 -f
> But freedom for Epictetus is achieved not through the satisfactionof desire but through the suppression of desire for things that lie outside of our control. -p. 275 -q
> ... we don't control events; we control only how we react and respond to events... if you choose the latter course, Epictetus tells us, you will find a new freedom and inner peace and willl nto expend psychic energy blaming others... if we do not... we will livei nconstnt fear, anxietyy, pain, and distress... -p. 276 -q
> For Epictetus, the autonomous self has three components: judgement, desire/aversion, and volition or choice. -p. 278 -q
> We choose the peace and tranquility of our souls over attempts to control external events... by letting go of whatt lies outside of our control, we find happiness, serenity, and an untroubled mind. -p. 278-9 -q
> ... although the Stoic sage treats externals with indifference, he does not view his relationships with others as externals, but rather as fundamental aspects of his own humanity. And those relationships may engender positive emotions of love, gratitude, and affection. -p. 279 -q
> That is one of Stoicism's harshest lessons: 'no good man laments, nor sighs, nor groans.' -p. 280 -q
> According to Stoic doctrine generally, and Epictetus in particular, the universe is governed by an all-wise, all-good divinity.-p. 280 -q
> If god equals nature, if the divinity is immanent rather than transcendant, then much of the religious overlay of Stoicism simply disappears... God becomes a trope for the preternaturals mystery, beauty, wonder, and order of the natural world. -p. 281 -q
> 'My formula for greatness in a human being is amor fati: that one wants nothing to be different, not forward, not backward, not in all eternity. Not mearly bear what is necessary, still less conceal it - all idealism is medaciousness in the face of what is necessary - but love it. -p. 282 -q
> Keep the prospect of death and loss always before your mind, he [Epictetus] advises. Then nothing will seem terrible to you. -p. 283 -q
> MARCUS AURELIUS, m, Roman, 1st c. -- Emperor of Rome; writing of his _Meditations_. -p. 284 -q
> The rules of life on which Marcus rings changes are few but fundamental: 'a pious acceptance of the day's happenings, a just dealing towards the day's associates, and a scrupulous attention of the day's impressions'. They correspond to the tthree disciplines of Epictetus - assent and judgement; desire and aversion; inclinatiion and action... these 'three disciples of life'... The man who practices and lives these three disciples will be wise, moderate, pious, and loving in all things. Most important, he will live live freely and fully in the present. -p. 286 -q
> R.B. Rutherford notes 'the unique note of unhappiness and disillusionment that permeates the Meditations'.-p. 287 -q
> The basic moral teaching [beliving in a personal v.s. deist god] is the same; we can will our conformity with circumstance. -p. 288 -q
> These interined convictions - divine prpovidence and the brotherhood of man - are the two premises of his {Marcus Aurelius] life. From them he derives a litany of virtues that he praises throughout the Meditations: courtesy, piety, serenity, generosity, simplicity, love, duty, justice, industriousness, charity, kindliness, and unselfconscious diginity. -p. 290 -q
> 'Life is short', Marcus warns, 'and this early existence has but a single fruit to yield - holiness within and selfless action without.' -p. 291 -q

> But solitude was his [Nietzsche] essential lot and indeed the essential condition in which his books were forged. He was a man without wife or children, without a job or a home, without a country, and without a church. He was, perhaps, as thoroughly alone as it is possible to be. -p. 18 -q
> Nietzsche walked in the mountains, in the woods, and along the shores of lakes. He always carried a little notebook with him to record his thoughts... -p. 138 -q

> ... Christanity -- which Nietzsche called Platonism for the people... -p. 152 -q
> Ultimately, the only way to overcome nihilism is to embrace the loss of any fixed point of reference. Bereft of all certainties, man must rely upon his own will to create goals and values for himself that will give meaning to his life. He must learn to will, to want, and to love. -p. 155 -q

> This beautiful parable [On the three metamorposes] is at the core of Nietzsche's thought. He considers art and philosophy (and to a lesser extent science) to be mans highest activities because they engage the human spirit in imposing order on, and infusing value into, the world. -p. 158 -q

> The contents [of BEING AND TIME] would have given her [Heidegger's mother] little consolation; the book argues that confronting the nothingness and inevitability of death is what gives authenticity to life. -p. 206 -q
> Heidegger wants to recapture a sense of wonder and astonishment at the sheer Being of beings, at the fact that there is something rather than nothing. That sense of wonder should not be dissipated in false and nonsensical explanations about the grounds and essence of Being. the fact of existence, in the midst of the possibility of nothingness, is itself what is so astonishing. -p. 211 -q

Black articians had repeatedly led revolts to overturn slavery... Jefferson could not be expected to look beyond the conventions he feared from the presence of free blacks everywhere in the South to envision a future when a flight of blacks to cities reduced the role of rural slavery and thus not only increase the resilience of yeoman agrarianism but also provided urban markets close by. -p. 53-4 -q

> Tao means 'The Way.'. The Tao is the Way to live in order to achive by non-doing. -q
> The basic tenets [of Taoism] are four: 1) that the "Way" of Tao underlies all things, 2) that human action that is harmonious with Tao is spontaneous, effortless, and inexhaustible, 3) that the perfected individual is a sage, free from desire and strife, and 4) that the sage conducts government by guiding his people back to a state of harmony with the Tao. -q
> ... shamanism, the aboriginal root of religions. -q
> Therefore the sage goes about doing nothing, teaching no-talking... Creating, yet not posessing, Working, yet not taking credit. Work is done, then forgotten. -q
> The sage stays behind, thus he is ahead. He is detached, thus at one with all. Through selfless action, he attains fulfillment. -q
> In dwelling, be close to the land. In meditation, go deep in the heart. In dealing with others, be gentle and kind. In speech, be true. In ruling, be just. In business, be competent. In action, watch the timing. No fight: No blame. -q

> Therefore the sage takes care of all men and abandons no one. He takes care of all things and abandons nothing. -q
> Therefore the sage avoids extremes, excesses, and complacency. -q
> Weapons are instruments of fear; they are not a wise man's tools. He uses them only when he has no choice. -q

> The sage has no mind of his own. He is aware of the needs of others. ... The sage is shy and humble - to the world he seems confusing. Men look to him and listen. He behaves like a little child. -q

> Myst : the book of Atrus, by Rand and Robyn Miller with David Wingrove, is a work of fiction. Atrus is D'ni, a people with the ability to create worlds through writing.  The story begins with Atrus living with his grandmother; helping her around her estate, and learning about the world. Then his father Ghen comes to take him away to the age of D'ni. Here, the father teaches the son the art of writing. Atrus quickly excels, so quickly that he is able to see fatal flaws in the way that his father writes. After many disagreements, Ghen locks him away. But Ghen's fiance Catherine helps rescues Atrus. The story ends with Catherine and Atrus creating their own age to live in. I would recommend this to one who enjoys fantasy, books, and parent/child relationships.  -p.  -r

> All members are expected to do their own study and thinking and to arrive at their own convictions about matters of religious faith. Faith is viewed as a religious quest involving the celebration of life rather than the giving of intellectual assent to some fixed, traditional creed which originated iys: "Unitarian Universalism is cooperation with a universe that created us; it is a celebration of life; it is being in love with goodness and justice; it is a sense of humor about absalists. For some of the Transcendentalists such as Ralph Waldo Emerson, there was a world soul which permeated all of life. With "intuition" one could place oneself in contact with it. Hence the solitary individual walking in the autumn woods may well intuit his or her relationship to the world soul. -q
> The purpose of a liberal religious society was to provide a place for bringing people together for addressing personal, community, and world problems and aspirations. For the humanists, then, one could be religious even without belief in God. -q

Gratitude is the intention to count your bless every day, everyy minute, while avoiding, whenever possible, the belief that you neeed or deserve different circumstances. -p. 16-17 -q 
> There are at least four reasons that desire for More causes suffering: (1) no one avoids sorrow, humiliation, or pain, and no one avoids death; (2) striving for More is not fun; (3) the desire for More often does harm; and (4) the desire for More ignores spiritual longing.t
> According to [Aldous] Huxley, the Perennial Philosophy has three essential elements: First, ordinary things, ordinary lives, and ordinary minds are made o divine stuff.

> Chimpanzees are more closely related to humans than horses are related to zebras. Human DNA is 98.4 percent identical to Chimpanzee DNA. -p. 68 -q
> It is more accurate to say that human beings and animals strive for the PREREQUISITES to reproductive success... that's why the existence of happy childless people, gay men, or lesbian wwomen does not contradicct evolutionary psychology. -p. 69 
> The fundamental problem is that, from an evolutionary perspective, there is no such thiing as ENOUGH reprodutive success... such an instinctive mechanism would contradict the basic principles of human evolution. -p. 75-76 -q

> In cognative  psychotherapy, the therapist actually helps the client learn to think in different patterns. -p. 81 -q
> Actions often arise automatically from thoughts and beliefs... -p. 81 -q
> Assumptions of cognative therapy: 1) many conscious thoughts and beliefs are simply habits; 2) conscious thoughts and beliefs have powerful and inevitable emotional consequences; 3) conscious beliefs can become submerged and difficult to identify; 4) the most powerful method of changing involuntary reactions or breaking bad habits is to discard old habits of thinking and develop new ones. -p. 87-88 -o
> I suggest the following definition of Compassion: Compassion is the intention to think and act as if you are no more entitled toget what youwant than anyone else. -p. 98 -q
> Changing your thinking habits is a four step process. Step One is to identify habitual thoughts that need to change. Step Two is to formulate new thoughts to take the place of old ones. Step Three is to continually substitute the new, desired thoughts for the old, undesired ones as you continue to live your life normally. Step Four is to make the effort to behave in ways consistent with new thoughts. -q
> Hatred is what happens when you deliberately nurse your own anger, deliberately intensifying it and prolonging it  with non-compassionate thinking. -p. 104 -q
> The Zen story discourages us from making unnecessary value judgements about our present experiences and circumstances. -p. 131 -q
> Value judgements are necessary when two conditions are met: First, there is something you can do about the situation. Second, the remedy does more good than harm to you and the people around you. -p. 133 -q
> Whatever you feel, feel it completely, without reservation. Whatever you see, see it completely, without reservation... -p. 138 -q

> Three benefits of practicing Attention: 1) Attention relieves anxiety, depression, and anger; 2) Attention helps you learn from your mistakes; 3) When you pay attention, you independently discover the essential human condition. -p. 143 -q

Allow your gaze to rest on a point on the wall before you about level with your knees. Avoid all deliberate mental activity. When mental activity arises spontaneously, observe it dispassionately, as best you can. When you realize that you have gotten caught up in deliberate mental activity, do not rebuke yourself. Just calmly return to dispassionate observatin. -p. 143-4 -q

Ming-Dao, Deng. -- Scholar warrior. -- HarperCollins, c1990. -- vi, 351 p. -- ISBN 0062502328. -- DDC 299
> I. Beginnings (The scholar and warrior are not separate ways. Both skills are needed for balance) -o
> VIII Resolving doubts (Continuous learning -- the necessity of competition -- Finding your fatal flaw -- Discipline -- Nonviolence -- Avoiding isolation -- Relationships -- Technology and Taoism -- The  nature of simplicity -- The future of Taoism). -o
> XII Returning to the source - The ultimate wisdom: about emptiness. 
> The Taoists believe that it is humanity's refusal to regard itself as part of a greater order that causes confusion, ignorance, and sorrow. -p. 4 -q
> For the Taoists, a complete way of life is deeply spiritual. But their defition of spiritual is unique. They define it as rooted in the body and rooted in life itself. The spirit is not separate from any other aspect of living. -p. 5 -q
> The Three Treasures: jing (biochemical character; diet and sex), qi (energy of the body; cleannliness, psychology/emotions), shen, (energy of the mind). -p. 22 -f
> ... the progression from jing to qi to shen happens in each of us every day. What the Scholar Warrior seeks is to become aware of this process, cooperate with it. -p. 32 -q
> QIGONG: the art of cultivating the qui. -- Anything that trains the breath and culivates stamina, like swimming and hiking. -- The essence of qigong: immunity, projection, humility. -p. 38 -f
> The masters exert their influence subtly through diet, excercise, and simple example. -p. 50 -q
> With knowledge and the cultivation of intellectual abilities, you need not be buffeted by great forces or victimied by the limitations of your own minuscule pool of thoughts. -p. 54 -q
> Extablishing ethics builds character. Academic involvement builds intelligence. With these two assets, the third treasure, shen, is safeguarded. -p. 54 -q
> It [Taoism] is based on direct observation and relies on pragmatic appeal when addressing its constituents. -p. 176 -q
> It [Taoism] probably had its earliest beginnings among nature worshipers and shamans. -p. 177 -q
> For the Taoist, the Tao and the flow of events was impersonal. -p. 177 -q
> Taoists are empirical. THey test their beliefs in the world, and everything they believe is up for questioning and reexamination at any time. -p. 177 -q
> ... inwardly, the Taoists never relied on a concept of heaven and hell. -p. 179 -q
> ... the Taoists asserted that life itself had no guarentees. They wanted spirituality to address itself to that, not to urge peopel to go further into even more uncertain territory... the skeptical Taoists wanted to do everything in the here and now. -p. 179 -q
> ... the Taoists believed that wisdom comes from self-cultivation; service built personal character but was not considered the ultimate means to attain wisdom. -p. 180 -q
> In short, the Taoists eliminedated the usual basis for religion. The ultimate justification for spirituality was not in the promise of an afterlife, not in the gods, not in ritual, and not in clerical authority, but in the honest and personal exploration of this life and this time. Taoists were the mavericks of the spiritual world. They did not care for conformity, or for the attitudes of the herd. All they cared about was the honest search for the truth and the direct experiencing of the Tao. -p. 180 -q
> As the Toists say, 'Tao does not act, yet there is nothing that it does not do.' ... Wu wei means nonaction, non-doing... The wu wei -- nonaction -- of Tao is that it acts without conscious thought. -p. 185 -q
> Emptiness is useful. -p. 185 -q
> True living of wu wei is to live in accord with the Tao and to attain a state of such perfect understanding and insight that all actions are spontaneously correct. -p. 186 -q
> During a fight, there is no sense of self-preservaation, no sense of cruelty, no sense of the self, no sense of the need to dominate the other person. There is only spontaneous acction. At this point, such a warrior may truly be said to be empty. -p. 186 -q
> The Taoists felt that society violated true human nature. Civilization distorted the inner spirit with its artificial standards, its tiresome etiquette, its pandering to human perversions. -p. 186 -q
> After we have lived life fully, perhaps traveled extensively
> When they [Taoists] say to give up learning, they mean that we should transcend technical details and enter into a creative state in which our actions are deeply intuitive and correct. -p. 187 -q
> We should, in fact, remain impartial to all things. -p. 192 -q
> The Taoist is a person who seeks to turn all things to advantage. -p. 193 -q
> Nip it in the bud. -p. 193 -q
> Such a person [a Taoist], man or women, is described as subtle, mysterious, dark, penetrating, deep, unrecognizable, and obscure. -p. 196 -q
> Taoists virtue means having no intentions. -p. 198 -q
> Although the Taoists regected the notion of society as an evil, they did recognize that people could live together in a community... A life of serenity, contentment, and harmony with nature were the goals that Taoists advanced for their communities. -p. 199 -q
> Humility, service, and compassion should be qualities that even a warrior should cultivate and excercise. -p. 205 -q
> There is no guarantee of what you might find after death, so it is far better to do something great while alive. -p. 206 -q
> Spring: Time of birth -- Summer: time of youth and experimentation, testing, and balancing. -- Autumn: one's middle age, when Scholar Warriors are in their prime. -- Winter: time of withdrawal and contemplation. -p. 202-5  -o
> Taoists never adhere to the extremes in life. They eschew fanaticism and obsession. -p. 203 -q
> From death back to birth, Taoists use the metaphore of seasons to regulate their lives... To be a Taoist is to discern the patterns of nature and to align ourselves with their movement. -p. 206 -q
> They [Taoists] believe that we all embody curiosities, tendencies, yearnings, and desires for knowledge. These elements must not be suppressed,  but must be given full expression. If we don't do this, we will not be able to realize emptiness, for our inner need for expression will be unfulfilled. Only by the proper excercise of our goals can we clear away these elements of our personalities. -p. 207 -q
> All answers are within us; we need only calm ourselves to find them. -p. 207 -q
> Face life. Don't run away from it; don't take drugs or wine to shield yourself. Don't overdramatize life; don't romanticize it. Don't project any fantasies or illusions on it. Just face it. That is the essence of Taoism. -p. 209 -q
> A true Taoist goes trhough life buoyed by an inner purpose and understanding of both the workings of nature and his or her own character. This inner understanding is expressed not by contentious assertion but through a unique efortlessness, wu wei. -p. 210 -q
> Tao is empty, but this emptiness is dynamic, productive, and positive. -p. 210 -q
> What does matter is that the master is qualified and that there is a true relationship between master and student. -p. 212 -q
> Your life is always very much your own responsibility. -p. 213 -q
> Everything soon crumbles... this life is but a dream... at least we can dream the dream we want, and at least we can maintain our skills until the time that our soul disolves. Experience and skill are the two things that no one can take away. -p. 223 -q
> ... learning is valuable in and of itself, for it allows us to wonder, to play with new knowledge, to combine it with other things we know. -p. 226 -q
> The Taoists do not mean that you should learn the ways of others in order to be like them, only that you should learn the ways of others to avoid beiing manipulated by them. -p. 226 -q
> Why surrendor your rights of knowledge and action to other people, professionals or not? It is far better to be able to depend on yourself, adn this is impossible without deep learning. -p. 227 -q
> A Scholar Warrior never enters a building, a room, the forest, without first ascertaining the possible sources of attack and all possible routes of escape. Eventually, the practice of noting the weakness of others, and the constant movement within the context of one's surroundings, become a reflex. -p. 228 -q
> But once you have acquired the awareness of others' flaws, you need not poke at every one of them. -p. 228 -q
> If my opponent does not move, I do not move. If my opponent moves, I attack first. -p. 229 -q
> While you search for this flaw [your fatal flaw], you should take refuge in humility. -p. 230 -q
> Try to find every single flaw in yourself and eradicate it. -p. 230 -q
> In the warrior's way, we must strive to close our vulnerabilities. -p. 230 -q
> One's mind becomes a warrior's mind: fierce, calculating, assertive, and always aware of everyone's weakness. -p. 233 -q
> Master warriors experience a mystic unity -- the oneness that sages constantly refer to -- in training, performance, and battle. -p. 234 -q
> If one understands the concept of yin and yang, how can their be yielding without assertion? One cannot be yielding forever. -p. 236 -q
> The opposite of nonviolence is not violence but action. -p. 236 -q
> ... Scholar Warriors are nonviolent because they are in control of their situation. They don't need to turn the other cheek because no one is going to slap them in the first place. -p. 236 -q	
> The Scholar Warrior would urge you to be gentle but to be prepared to defend yourself and others. -p. 237 -q
> The Tao ultimately manifests itself only outside of society. -p. 240 -q
> TAOISM: "the system of knowledge about the Tao" -p. 240 -f
> It was not the words so much as the experience that mattered; by computerizing it all, one was admitting a powerful poison into Taoism and missing the actual value of the writings. -p. 242 -q
> Taoism has always been the method of awakening people from the illusions of the world. -p. 243 -q
> If kept in that context, there is little harm in technology. Use it, but remain detached from it. Some day, you will have to leave it behind. -p. 244 -q
> That is why Lao Tzu says, "Give up learning," meaning give up the unwise teachings of a shortsighted society. -p. 246 -q
> Don't rush to full realization -- because at that point, everything becomes meaningless. It is far better to practice the ways of physical purification, sound philosophy, and spiritual practice with moderation. -p. 247 -q
> [Taoism is] a tradition that urges contentment, acceptance, self-discipline, and inward contemplation... -p. 248 -q
> Our aging, our thinkng, our urges, our sexuality, our wonder about the universe, our need to find a reason for our existance, our imperative to know ourselves, and our own mortality will always need examination and action. -p. 249 -q
> Look within. All answers are there. -p. 251 -q
> But the Scholar Warrior who has seen the futility of life and has realized the limits of human learning by trying with every resource to break those limits is ready for tranquillity, ready for stillness. -p. 253 -q
> GUAN: aTaoist temple. -p. 285 -f
> The Taoists say that most animals meditate - only human beings are foolish enough to have forgotten it. -p. 285 -q
> Just sit, and wait, and practice with the perserverance of the heron, and you will slowly find the way. -p. 287 -q
> But that is not true faith; that is mere slavery. True faith is the ability to wait and to engage in an activity for its own sake. -p. 288 -q
> It is fatly impossible to achieve personal excellence without daily solitude. -p. 305 -q
> definition of Tao: "the way" -p. 313 -q
> You must express what is unique within yourself. To do otherwise is to violate what is natural. -p. 310 -q
> The Taoists do not care about society. They know inwardly that the pursuit of material success is doomed to disappointment and heartache, and they add that every instant when the personality is unbalanced will diminish one's health and life span. -p. 309 -q
> You will only wear yourself out trying to pursue the latest trends and whatever is being held up as today's ideals. There is no need to become any more involved with socity than you have to. It is a ecessary evil, but as with taking medicine that is toxic, one needs to limit the doses of society one takes. When you can withdrawal from the race, you should do so. -p. 310 -q
> None of these paths is wrong. But the Taoist approach is quite different. -p. 312 -q
> one we are satisifed with our accomplishments, we can put them asside. -p. 316 -q
> Simplify yourself. After all the efforts you have made, this is the last effort. Let yoruself go. Look into the Tao each day until you become the Tao... That is when you will realize your own essential emptiness. -p. 316 -q
> 'How should any person, man or women, learn the ultimate truth?' asked Lu. 'He should realize emptiness,' Han Zhongali replied. 'That is the only wisdom that goes beyon skill and knowledge.' -p. 320 -q
> Let us not entangle ourselves in doctrinal struggles, but take what we can for ourselves. -p. 321 -q
> No one knows where what thought [of creation] came from, but it set things in motion. In that first moment, qi was formed. The qi began to move and separate, and thus became diffentiated into yin and yang. From yin and yang came the five elements: fire, earth, metal, water, and wood. From yin and yang came the five elements: fire, earth, metal, water, and wood. Then the ten thousand things in the universe were generated.. Things do not expand forever, however, but return to emptiness. -p. 321 -1
> This is why Han Zhongali calls the world of phenomena empty. He means that it is empty of any inhearent reality. -p. 323 -q
> The Taoists say wae can't depend on anything. -p. 323 -q
> According to what has been taught in our religious theories, a human being consists of three sheaths: the body, the mind, and the soul. -p. 326 -q
> All phenomena are empty, and we ourselves are empty. By dissolving our attachment to body, mind, and spirit, we dissolve the veils that divide us from the Tao. -p. 328 -q

> If we regard ideas as tools to help us get around in the world, we might say that he sciences and various religions offer different maps of the same world. -p. 52 -q
> In most of these understandings of ruach, it seems that hte Spirit of God is related to the kind of energy o force which on the one hand sustains life and on the other hand disturbs an esisting state of affairs. -p. 58 -q

After a light breakfast, Melissa might tend the garden or start baking a few loaves of bread, followed by some time on her computer, either writing letters, organizing recipies, or helping out a local charitable organization by entering data on spreadsheets for them. By late morning, melissa takes off on her bicycle to visit family or fiends, go to the library (where she spends time on personal research projects), or run errands. Lunch and dinner are usually simple one-dish affairs made from scratch.

> Religion is built on authority, which could be wrong. Science is built on the senses, which could be wrong. Mathematics and logic are built on reason, which could be wrong. -p. 86 -q
> ... a few things become clear beyond all doubt to al-Ghazali: first, God is real; second, at our innermost point we are connected to God (in other words, the soul is immortal); and third, od wants something of us, namely, for us to be and do good. -p. 89 -q
> Once you accept that pleasure and pain are the ultimate guides to action... -p. 87 -q
> ... derangement of the sences... -p. 89 -q
> Admittedly, when discussing immersion in the divine, we're in far over our heads. -p. 91 -q
> We're presented with a paradox that is an invitation to the inmost experience of the universe. We're presented with a holy poem. -p. 94 -q
> ... the final moment involves turning to ritual practice in order to sustain in our fallible lives the infinate truth that we're been entrusted with. In the case of love, this tends to mean marriage. -p. 94 -q
> Science in the yellow snowmobile helmet will neer be able to enter into what being alive is about. -p. 96 -q
> What is philosophy or religion - or human life for that matter - but the attempt to relate to the meaningful hugeness revealed in such experiences without sounding or acting like a total fool, at our best with a touch of style? -p. 98 -q
> It occurs to him [Descartes] that the support beam of almost all our beliefs is the senses. he first muted doubt 9the doubt of the first meditation builds into a kind of intellectual crescendo) is that the senses sometimes deceives us: for instance, we see water on the road, which proves in actuality to be a mirage. -p. 103 -q
> In the beginning stages of human life, we accept the basis of culture on authority. Then, when we go deeper into the ultimate, we find that reason blanks at its sunlight intensity, and we must utilize the mirrors of myth, symbol, and ritual to picture it. Certainly, this usual relationship to the divine still holds to picture it. -p. 116 -q
> Pascal sums up our condition in three words: 'Inconstancy, bordom, anxiety' - a striking outline of the problem of being human. -p. 122 -q
> 'Wretchedness' is Pascal's shorthand for that part of the human condition he analyzes with the terms 'anxiety,' 'diversion,' 'bordom,' 'inconstancy,' and 'vanity. -p. 127 -q
> A sensible religion is absurd because human nature is anything but sensible. -- In short, Pascal thinks that Christianity, the most scandalous of all religions, is our only hope. Islam and Judaism makes too much sense. I can only imagine what he would have made of Unitarianism. -p. 133 -q
> 'Man's greatness comes from knowing he is wretched,' in Pascal's fine phrase. We stand a much better chance of winning hte forgiveness game than the law game. Yet forgiveness can take place only within a context of the law. -p. 134 -q
> Christianity is, as I said, a religion that stretches credulity. To be a Christian is to belive any number of paradoxes: that true morality appears in the context of immorality, that god is human, that power is expressed in suffering, and that this human God, uttering the famous cry of abandonment on the cross, is something of an athiest. -p. 135 -q

> It was under the rubric of magic as thus traditionally conceived that the Taoist Church -- dividing the territory with freelance wizards, exorcists, and shamans -- divised ways to harness higher powers for humane ends. -p. 206 -q
> The object of Philosophical taoism is to align one's daily life to the Tao, to ride its boundless tide and delight in is flow. The basic way to do this, we earlier noted, is to perfect a life of wu wei. We have seen that wu wei should not be translated as do-nothingness or inaction... Better renderings are pure effectiveness and creative quietute. -p. 207 -q
> Confucious turned enver effort to building a pattern of ideal responsives that might be consciously imitated. Taoism's approach is the opposite -- to get the foundations of the self in tune with Tao and let behavior flow spontaneously. -p. 208 -q
> One simply lets the Tao flow in and out again until all life becomes a dance in which there is neither feaverishness nor inballance... far from inaction, however, it is the embodiment of suppleness, simplicity, adn freedom -- a kind of pure effectiveness in which no motion is wasted and bickering on outward show. -p. 208 -q
> The natural phenominon hat Taoist's saw as bearing he closest resemblance to Tao was water... still following the analogy of water, the Taoists rejected all forms of slef-assertivness and ambition. -p. 209, 211 -q
> Such a one acts without strain, persuades without arguement, is eleqquent without flourish, and achives results without violence, coersion, or pressure. -p. 210 -q
> Taoism seeks attunement with nature, not dominance. -p. 213 -q

> Although he lives with great intention, Suelo seems to go whichever way the wind blows... 'Randomness is my guru,' he told me... Yet Suelo does not become too attached. He knows that at any moment a ranger could arrive and whisk him along.  -p. 27 -q
> Suelo found his niche -- a good job that didn't require moral compromise, a community that accepted him, and a way of living hopelessly without shame.  -p. 141 -q
> People came here [Moab] to do whatevert he hell they wanted.  -p. 132 -q

> Knowing the sacred direction toward the center of the galaxy and returning to it over and again will be part of the empowering process that will enable them, slowly and subconsciously, to think of themselves not jus as political or economic entities. -p. 58-9 -q
> When a child looks toward the galactic center, she needs to remember the whooly mammoths and the saber-toothed tiers and paleo-Indians. And the brief time in which civilization explodes onto the scene. All that great volume of time was necessary for the photons rushing at light speed to reach us tonight as we gaze into the galaxy's center. -p. 59-60 -q

The concerns of the day, however important they might seem in the sunlight, usually amount to nothing more than unwelcome distractions in the night when the great story is told in the glow from the fire's embers and Moon's jouney through the branchd shadows of the trees. -p. 68 -q	
> To tell the story of the birthplace of the universe is to tell the story of Eintein... But here is the strange thing. How can I tell the story of the universe without first speaking of Einstein, for he is a fountainhead of the story of the universe as a whole? Einstein can be seen as a power that destroys one world and creates another... No one in the entire world at that time could understand the reality of the Einstein-event. p. 70 -q
> More precisely: galaxies twice as far apart are sailing away from each other twice as fast. Galaxis ten times as far apart sail away ten times as fast... we find an event of cataclysmic energy where all trillion galaxies are brought into a single ineffable point, the birthplace of the universe, the iniial singularity of space-time, the center of the universe. -p. 76 -q
> The idea that the universe began in one place is certainly an ancient one in human history. The image of a birthplace of the universe occurs in the mythical and classical forms of consciousness, and possibly even earlier. -p. 76 -q
> Thus, the scientific discovery [of the beginning of the universe] has this dual nature of being both old [stories of creation] and new [the big bang] simultaneously... The aim is not to eliminate one way of knowing in favor of another; the aim in an ultimate sense is an integral understanding of the universe grounded in both the scientific empirical detail and in our primordial poetic visions of the cosmos. -p. 77 -q
> Instead, I want to remember that humans have a variety of paths to the truth and when these various of paths to the truth and when these various routes arrive at a common consensual knowledge we have he possibility of a story of the universe that can guide us as a whole species as we enter a new millennium. -p. 79 -q
> Earth is one planet moving around one start, which in turn is one of the three hundred billion stars of the Milky Way Galaxy, which in turn is one of a trillion galaxies in the wide universe. -p. 80 -q

> The Privy Council is one of the oldest of Britain's political institutions, with the most important of the Crown's advisers among its members, including by convention all Cabinet ministers. Its meetings — usually of a few ministers in the presence of the Queen — are now purely formal, but the oath taken by new members reinforces the obligation of secrecy in conducting government business, and the issue of 'Orders in Council' is still an important procedure for enacting the legislation not requiring the approval of Parliament. -q

First, it is unwise to intervene in such situations unless you have a clear, agreed objective and are prepared and able to commit the means to secure it.

Third, one must avoid taking on a major regional power, like Syria, unless one is prepared to face up to the full consequences of doing so. -q

> for O’Connor there was little difference between a judicial and a political philosophy. -- She had an uncanny ear for American public opinion, and she kept her rulings closely tethered to what most people wanted or at least would accept. -- William Brennan, observed in 1985, “the genius of the Constitution rests not in any static meaning it might have had in a world that is dead and gone, but in the adaptability of its great principles to cope with current problems and current needs.” p. 18 -q -- John Marshall Harlan II, m, 20th c, Supreme Court Justice. -f -- [Souter] believed that law existed to preserve the stability of society and that adherence to precedent best guaranteed a limited and predictable role for the judiciary. Above all, he believed in the rule of stare decisis. -p. 53 -q -- Souter believed that the Constitution expressed a libertarian ideal—that freedom from the restrictions of government counted as much as, or more than, the right of legislators to pass laws limiting individual freedom. -q -- And the people’s rights were not limited by the precise language of the Constitution, either. One of the strongest arguments against so-called unenumerated rights in the Constitution is that a written document should be limited in meaning to its precise terms. -q -- Souter avoided attention, loathed controversy, and disliked high-profile cases. -q -- Equanimity, WOTD -f -- waylaid, WOTD -f -- alacrity, WOTD -- Clinton's thoughts about abortion: safe, legal—and rare. -- [RBG] felt laws banning abortion were a form of sex discrimination—a violation of equal protection of the laws—rather than an affront to the right to privacy, as Blackmun’s opinion had held. -- choice of Ruth Bader Ginsburg—arguably Clintons seventh choice -f -- James Madison in Federalist No. 45, Rehnquist wrote, “The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal government are few and defined. Those which are to remain in the State governments are numerous and indefinite.” -- “color-blind Constitution -- If one wants to be popular, it is counterproductive to disagree with the majority. If one just wants to tread water until the next vacation, it isn’t worth the agony. If one just wants to muddle through, it is not worth it. -Clarence Thomas -q -- [Clarence Thomas'] office, a little sign reads: ‘To avoid criticism, say nothing, do nothing, be nothing. -- [Renquist] had reduced the job to its essentials: a morning meeting with his law clerks to talk about the progress of opinions, a meeting with his administrative assistant to address issues affecting the federal judiciary, lunch at his desk, review of paperwork after lunch, and limousine home by 4:00 p.m. -- Gilbert and Sullivan operettas, Iolanthe: “I did nothing in particular, and I did it very well.” -- O’Connor, the practical consequences would matter more than the legal theory, -- reading briefs, hearing arguments, and writing opinions. -- The gay clerks changed the Court, not because of their advocacy but because of their existence. -- (As usual at oral argument, the lawyer was largely a spectator as the justices talked to one another.) -- sophistry, WOTD -- [O'Connor's] judicial approach was indefensible in theory and impeccable in practice. -- For a Court majority determined never to stray too far from what the public believed, -- It is during our most challenging and uncertain moments that our Nation’s commitment to due process is most severely tested; and it is in those times that we must preserve our commitment at home to the principles for which we fight abroad.” -- Souter’s New England frugality -- Souter spoke of “every judge’s common obligations: suspicion of easy cases, skepticism about clear-edged categories, modesty in the face of precedent, candor in playing one worthy principle against another, and the nerve to do it in concrete circumstances on an open page. -- prickly personality --  ch. 20 in the wake of oconnors retiremenu conservaives come out against gonzolas. -s -- When she joined the Court in 1981, not one other justice believed that abortion laws should be tested under an “undue burden standard,” but O’Connor had invented that test and over time persuaded a majority of her colleagues to agree with her. She had single-handedly remade the law in the most controversial area of Supreme Court jurisprudence. -q -- Even Thomas had long since passed Scalia, en route to a kind of nineteenth-century conservatism. -q -- John Robert's philosophy: Decide more cases; achieve more unanimity; write narrower opinions—judicial minimalism. -f -- Cass Gilbert’s steps represent at some level a magnificent illusion—that the Supreme Court operates at a higher plane than the mortals who toil on the ground. But the Court is a product of a democracy and represents, with sometimes chilling precision, the best and worst of the people. We can expect nothing more, and nothing less, than the Court we deserve. -q -- Reserved, almost diffident, WOTD -f -- The framers viewed freedom from unlawful restraint as a fundamental precept of liberty, and they understood the writ of habeas corpus as a vital instrument to secure that freedom. -q -- These meditations were in the tradition of ‘penumbras,’ ‘emanations,’ and other airy constructs the Court has employed over the years as poor substitutes for clear and rigorous constitutional reasoning.” -q -- As a result of the Court’s decision in Heller, it will be judges, not voters and elected officials, who will be answering these questions. And it will be years, and perhaps decades, before the courts even debate them. -q

> CH. 7: We created god, and endowed him (that is, god exists) to keep us well-behaved. -s
> Perhaps it's just me, but I am wary of any person whose belief system is the only thing standing between them and repulsive behavior. Why not assume that our humanity, including the self-control needed for a livable society, is built into us? -p. 2 -q
> Animal altruism. p. 4 -q 
> Animal empathy -p. 5 -f
> Empathy requires awareness of the other and the sensitivity to the other's needs. It probably started with parental care, like that found in the mammals, but there is also evidence for bird empathy. -p. 6 -q
> ... according to Paul MacLean, the American neuroscientist who named the limbic system the seat of the emotions... p. 6 -q
> From everything we know, the smaller the number of offspring an animal produces, the better it will take care of them... -p. 7 -q
> ... all life is caring, perhaps not consciously caring, but caring nontheless. -p. 8 -q
> If we consider our species without letting ourselves be blinded by the technical advances of the last few millennia, we see a creature of flesh and blood with a brain that, albeit three times larger than a chimpanzee's, doesn't contain any new parts. ... No one doubts the superiority of our intellect, but we have no basic wants or needs that are not also present in our closest relatives. -p. 16 -q
> Just like us, monkeys and apes strive for power, enjoy sex, want security and affection, kill over territory, and value trust and cooperation. Yes, we have computers and airplanes, but our psychological makeup remains that of a social primate. -p. 16 -q
> WESTERMARCK, EDWARD, m, Finnish. anthropoligist. Pioneer of morality research. -p. 18 -f
> This is what sets human morality apart: a move toward universal standards combined with an elaborate system of justification, monitoring, and punishment. -p. 18 -q
> The neo-atheist call themselves 'brights,' thus implying that believers are not as bright. -p. 18 -q
> Science is not in the business of spelling out the meaning of life and even less in telling us how to live our lives. -p. 19 -q 
> For example, female chimpanzees have been seen to drag reluctant males towards each other to make up after a fight, while removing weapons from their hands. Moreover, high-ranking males regularly act as impartial arbiters to settle disputes in the community. I take these hints of community concern as a sign that building blocks of morality are older than humanity, and that we don't need God to explain how we got to where we are today. -p. 20 -q
> I am profoundly skeptical of the moral purity of science, and feel that its role should never exceed that of morality's handmaiden. -p. 22 -q
> GALTON, FRANCIS, SIR, m, British, 20th c. Founder of Eugenics. -p. 22 -q
> ... what if moraliity is created in day0today social interaction... what if it is grounded in emotions... the whole point of my book is to argue a bottom-up approach... -p. 23 -q
> Daisy probbably extrapolated from how she feels leaning against the excelsior... I am convinced that apes take the perspective of others, expecially when it comes to friends in trouble. -p. 26 -q
> What permits us to tell right from wrong is our ability to be both good and bad. -p. 27 -q
> Even if one loses one's own life to save a relative, one still perpetuates genes that one has incommoon with this relative. Helping kin is therefore like helping oneself. -p. 30 -q
> Robert Trivers, an American evolutionary biologist, proposes the cooperation among nonrelatives often relies on reciprocal altruism: helpful acts that are costly in the short run nevertheless produce long-term benefits if favors are being returned. -p. 31 -q
> [Altruism] grows out of empathy with those in need, and the whole point of empathy is the blurring of the line between self and the other.  This obviously makes the difference between selfish and unselfish motives rather hazy. -p. 33 -q
> Mammels have what I call an 'altruistic impulse' in that they respond to signs of distress in others and feel an urge to improve their situation. To recognize the need of others, and react appropriately, is not the same as a preprogrammed tendency to sacrifice oneself for the genetic [maybe reproduction] good. -p. 33 -q
> VENEER THEORY, a/k/a Darwin's bulldog: seeing human kindness aas a charade and morality as a thin veneer over nasty tendencies. Developed by Huxley. -p. 34 -f 
> I decline to cite more smelly stuff. -p. 40 -q funny! -r
> Data have this wonderful quality of buryng theories. -p. 41 -q
> It is now widely assumed that we are designed in body and mind to live together and take care of each other, and that humans have a tendency to judge others in moral terms. -p. 42 -q
> In chimpanzee society, thereare no permament bonds between males and females, so that in principle any male might be your father. -p. 45 -q
> ... let's move away from such normative language and its implication that we are born to obey our genes. Even if sex evolved for reproduction, anyone is free (up to a point) to engage in it for fun. There is no law that says traits need each and every time to serve the purpose for which they evolved. -p. 47-8 -q
> Science tells us that we breathe in order to supplement our bodies with oxygen. -p. 48 -q
> ... we have 'emotional biases towards cooperation that can only be overcome with effortful cognative control.' -James Rilling -p. 48-9 -q
> Rilling further showed that when normal people aid others, brain areas associated with reward are activated. Doing good feels good. -p. 49 -q
> OXYTOCIN, hormone 'of love'. -f -p. 49
> Mammalian maternal care is the costliest, longest-lasting investment in other beings known in nature... -p. 49 -q
> Invariably, natures associates things that we need to do with pleasure... we are group animals, who rely on each other, need each other, and therefore take pleasure in helping and sharing. -p. 51 -q
> ... self-neglect is counterproductive... -p. 52 -q
> Given its intristic rewards, some like to label care for famlily and close associates'selfish' ... ths obviously undermindes the whole distinction between selfishness and altruism. If eating all the food on thhe table is just the selfish as my sharing it with a hungry stranger, language has become obsolete. How can a signle concept cover such divergent motivations? -p. 53 -q Nice argumentative method! -q
