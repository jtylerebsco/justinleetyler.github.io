> The spiritual numbness of the dominating culture is at the heart of its violence. Overt acts of violence against one another and against the earth emerge from a more covert violence: the loss of our capacities to feel and think. This loss happens through the suppression of the senses, of desire and of feeling; through the exile of pain and grief; and through the silencing of human dependence on one another and the earth. Critical analysis alone will not disempower this culture, nor will it change its effects. We need to recover our abilities to think and feel. Anesthetization needs to end in our lives. -q

> CH. 11: A discussion on how Jesus may have seen himself (as the Davidic Son of Man); and the "Kingdom of God". -s
> CH. 12: A discussion of Jesus's entry into Jeruselum, and death on the cross for the crime of Sedition. -s 
> CH. 14: Serious tentions between Paul and the Jerusalem community (Paul, James, etc.) -s
> The notion of history  as a critical analysis of obervable and verifiable events int he past is a product of the modern age; it would have been an altogether foreign concept to the gospel writers for whom history was not a matter of uncovering facts, but revealing truths.  -p. 21 -q
> John promised the Jews who came to him a new world order, the Kingdom of God. And while he never developed the concept beyond the vague notion of equality and justice, the promise itself was enough in thosee dark, turbulent times to draw to him a wave of Jews from all walks of life... -p. 82 -q
> John [the Baptist] is presented not as a member of a community but as a loner, a solitary voice calling out in the wilderness. -p. 85 -q
> When Jesus was born, Galilee was aflame. His first decade of life coincided with the plunder and destruction of ghe Galilean countryside, his second with its refashioning at the hands of Antipas. -p. 93 -q
> It would be these people whom Jesus would specifically target -- those who found themselves cast to the fringes of society, whose lives had been disrupted by the rapid social and economic shifts taking place throughout Galilee... Jesus's message was designed to be a direct challenge to the wealthy and the powerful, be they the occupiers in Rome, the collaborators in the Temple, or the new moneyed class in the Greek cities of Galilee. The message was simple: the Lord God has seen the suffering of the poor and dispossesed; he had heard their cries and anguish. And he was finally going to do something about it. -p. 96 -q
> With the Temple in ruins and the Jewish religion made pariah, the Jews who followed Jesus as messiah had an easy decision to make: they could either maintain their cultic connections to their parent religion and share in Rome's enmity (Rome's enmity towards Christians would peak much later), or they could divorce themselves from Judaism and tranform their messiah from a fierce Jewish nationalist into a pacifistic preacher of good works whose kingdom was not of this world. -p. 150 -q
> It was not only fear of Roman reprisal that drove these early Christians... a generation after Jesus's crucifixion, his non-followers outnumbered and overshadowed the Jewish ones. -p. 150 -q
> In the gospel of John, written in Ephesus sometime after 100 C.E. ... -p. 152 -q
> As with everything else in the gospels, the story of Jesus's arrest, trial, and excecution was written for one reason and one reason only: to prove that he was the promised messiah. -p. 154 -q
> But try as he might, Luke cannot avoid the most basic fact about his messiah: Jesus was executed by the Roman state for the crime of sedition. -p. 156 -q
> Nothing quite like what these followersof Jesus were contending [the taking of his corpse to an extravagant tomb; and the resurrection] existed at the time... But the concept of an individual dying and rising again, in the flesh, into a life everlasting was extremely rare in the ancient world and practically nonexistent in Judaism. -p. 165 -q
> ... this new,innovative, and thoroughly unorthodox interpretation of the messiah being peddled by a group of illiterate ecstatics whos ecertainty in their message was matched only by the passion with which they preached it. -p. 167 -q
> As with most converts from the distant Diasppora, he [Stephen] would have abandoned his hometown, sold his posessions, pooled his resources into the community, and made a home for himself in Jerusalem, undder th shadow of the Temple walls. -p. 167 -q
> The Son of Man, in Stephen's vision... is, in form and substance, God made flesh. -p. 169 -q
> The story of the zealous Galilean peasant and Jewish nationalist who donned the mantle of messiah and launched a foolhardy rebellion against the corrupt Temple priesthood and the vicious Roman occupation comes to an abrupt end, not with his death on the cross, nor with the empty tumb, but at the first moment one of his followers dares to suggest the he is God. Stephen [who made this clame] was martyred sometime between 33and 35 C.E. -p. 169 -q
> James's steady leadership over the Jerusalem assembly came to an end in 62 C.E., when he was executed by the high priest Ananus... p. 212 -q 
> For in the year 66 C.E., the same year that Jerusalem errupted in revolt, the emperor Nero, reacting to the sudden surge of Christian persecution in Rome, seized Peter and Paul and executed them both for espousing what he assumed was the same faith. -p. 196 -q

> On the basis of slender evidence, mostly the circumstances of his bachelorhood and three asides by contemporaries about his effeminacy, Buchanan has been dubbed America's first homosexual president. Referring to his femininity, Andrew Jackson once calleed him an 'Aunt Nancy'... Absent the discovery of new material, no one will ever know whether Buchanan and King (the only man whom his name was ever erotically connected) had sexual relations.  -p. 25 -q
> The best speculation about the sexuality of nonshaving Buchanan, who in his portrates has eunuchlike, endomorphic features of body and face as well as the low hairline characteristic of asexual men with low levels of testosterone, is that he had little interest in sex. -p. 26 -q
> Buchanan's letters to Harriet and all his faimly were the austere, distant expressions of a lifetime bachelor. p. 49 -q
> Buchanan did not campaign; such entreaties by the candidate himself were considered violations of the national understanding that conferring public office was a gift of the people. -p. 71 -q

> ... Buchanan gave every indication of severe mental strain affecting both his health and his judgement. -p. 130 -q
> ... It [Buchanan's prosouthernism] rests in his social and cultural iddentification with what he perceived as thesouther values of leisure, the gentleman's code of honor, and what George Cary Eggleston, a Virginia writer, once called 'a soft dreamy deliciously quiet life... with all its sharp corners removed. -p. 137 -q

> In this crisis three presidential failings - Buchanan's arrrogance that hecould  achive peace by being a partisan of the South, his ideological commitment to southern values, and his vision of the future with slavery gradually dying out - all came together to buttress a terrible presidential miscalculation. -p. 151 -q

> Here, Krishna is an Incarnation of the Divine Ground in human form. -p. 17 -q
> At the core of the Perennial Philosophy we find four fundamental doctrines: First, the phenomenal world of matter and of individualized consciousness... is the manifestation of a Divine Ground within... second: human beings... can... realize its existence by a direct intuition... Third: man possesses a double nature, a phenomenal ego and an external Self... Fourth: mans life on earth has only one purpose: to identify himself with the eternal Self and so to come to unitive knowledge of the Divine Ground. -p. 13 -q

> The world is imprisoned in its own activity, except when acctions are performed as worship of God. Therefore you must perform every action sacramentally, and be free from all attachments to results. -p. 45 -q
> Others who are ernest seekers for perfection and men of strict vows, study and meditate on the truths of the scriptures. That is their way of worship. -p. 54 -q

> II This Holy Ground / Eschatology: A. Types: 1. Social Gospel ('We were here to make God's dream... for all people' -p. 6). 2. Universalist eschatology ('hope for the earthly realization of Gods's dream [by] respond[ing] to the ultimate inclusiveness of God's love.' -p. 9). 3. Radically realized eschatology (... begins with afirming that we are already standing on holy ground. p. 12 -q). -o
> ... while politics is all about how we're going to make the world better, progressive religion tells us why it's necessary to work for change... Liberal faith traditions offer the essential metaphors and worldview that everything else derives from - the frames that give our dreams shape and meaning. It ha an invaluable role to play in helping our movement set its values and priorities, understand where we are in the larger scheme, and guage whether we're succeeding or not. -Sara Robinson -p. x -q
> Building a liberal theological heritage, which affirms that salvation belongs in this world... -p. xi -q
> Eschatology ... deal with the ultimate 'end' of live and of the earth, from the Greek eschaton, the last or final things. -p. xi -q
> Religious communities acts to bind us in covenant to one another and to purposes greater than oursevels - not merely as an agreement among mortals but as a shared human response to a sense of grace, interdependency, and responsibility. -p. xii -q
> ... Soteriology - from the Greek soteria, which means salvation, deliverance, preservation, or release. Religion, at its best, provides shelter for people and communiies in need of healing, transformation, or sustenance in difficulity. -p. xii -q
> What about God? How can we , or do we, speak of the ultimate mystery that is the source and sustenance of our lives - the source that some people call God? -p. xii -q
> In the liberal heritage, the notion that humanity is created in the image of God is foundational, making reflection on human experience a primary source of theology... -p. xiii -q
> How might liberal religion reclaim a doctrine of the Spirit - a pneumation (from the Greek pneuma, 'breath' or 'wind' - that affirms the importance of ritual and art? -p. xiii -q
> ... Rebecca developed the metaphore we use in this book - theology as habitation. -p. xvii -q
> ... 'theology' - whatever else it may connote - is about the structures of meaning that shelter and shape our way of living. -p. xvi -q
> It is often forgotten that religion in America has more often than not been liberal in its spirit and progressive in it social impact. -p. xviii -q
> [Unitarian Universalism] embraces multireligious life and learning found a tthe intersections... of spirituality. We share our reflections on these particular traditions as a gift, not a limit... we affirm religious pluralism, callaboration, and intrchange while simultaneously being grounded in our particular heritages of faith and practice. We seek to extend the welcome and the resources of progressive theology to people who are searching for a religious home that can support hteir aspirations of a just and sustainable world. At the same time, we are grateful for the opportunity to be guests at the tables of religious fellowship with others and to join with them in mutual learning and ranformation. -p. xxii -q
> Eschatology... is the teological term for 'speaking of inal things' - ultimate hopes... -p. 4 -q
> Ideals do not surround the soul with comfort or refeeshment and revew the heart's courage. -p. 9 -q
> Our framework of meaning can begin with appreciative and compassionate attention to this world, rather than imagining an ideal other world. -p. 13 -q
> There is nothing quite so salable in America as egotism wrapped in idealism. -p. 22 -q
> ... Unitarian Universalists - descendants of those Puritans and Englightenment rationalists who in the late 1700s palyed such a key role in the founding of the American Republic. -p. 23 -q
> Within the embrace of sacred gathering places, people come together to form connections with one another and with that which is holy and life-giving. -p. 33 -q
> Ecclesiology... is the theological theme that speaks about religious community. -p. 34 -q
> My suspiciaon is that religious conservatism has grown not because its theology is more inspiring than that of liberal theology, but because conservatives in recent decades have been better at creating and sustaining religious communities that offer people meaningful connections with one another and support in enduring life's trials and tribulations. -p. 37 -q
> I traveled a few summers ago to visit Unitarian congregations in TRansylvania. Part of the Hungarian minority in omania, the Unitarian mantained a space for reason and science as part of religion. -p. 39 -q
> Such community is established less by a historic creed or by apostolic tradition than by covenantal relations among the members. The role and responsibility of the members includes thinking for themselves, excercising their power to interpret scripture, to bless what is holy and to critique what is unjust, in a 'priesthood and prophethood of all believers.' Diversity and dissent are holy gifts. Rituals and spiritual practices are subjected to ethical criteria: do they support actions that are compassionate and just? -p. 41 -q
> In place of an established creed that all consented to, people were consent to to the common agreements of the community, worked out through democratic process. -p. 41 -q
> To help myself, I started each morning by sitting quietly to meditate and concentrate my awareness on love. I created an altar to help myself remember my sense of purpose. I pu up a picture of earth from outer space. I arranged a vase of fresh flower. I lit candles. I'd become peaceful and focused. -p. 43 -q
> Much in our dominant culture can lull people into numbness, complacency, or compliance. -p. 45 -q
> 'What do we all belive in common? What ancient formulae of faith are we willing to confess together?' in favor of the more covenantal questions: 'What spiritual hopes do we share? What shall we cpromise o one another and to God as we try to live together toward our hopes? How shall we then try to treat one another? -p. 51 -q
> All people need a framework of meaning by which to negotiate the 'many dangers, toils, and snares' that confront their lives. Our frameworks support us when threats come. They even shape what threats we see and guide what response we choose as trustworthy or wise. -p. 62 -q
> The alternative theology of salvation emphasizes (1) that human beings need to be saved from the consequences of human sin - no from God's punishing wrath; and (2) that salvation comes through the powers of live and goodness, present within and around us. -p. 63 -q
> In sum, the liberal theoloical perspective emphasizes that both sin and salvation ,evil and the redemption of evil, are in our hands. -p. 63 -q
> Sin matters not becauwe it disspponts, offends, or alienates God, but because it destroys life-giving relationships of love and justice in human affairs - leaving ragedy and broken hearts in its wake. -p. 67 -q
> What is evil? Evil is that which exploits the lives of some to benefit the lives of others. -p. 68 -q
> The consequences of evil are displayed by trouble in earth's ecosystems - disappearing species, melting ice caps, the tinning ozone. -p. 68 -q
> Calness in the face of evil comes to those who, rather than being frantic to pure it, concentrte their attention on recognizing and resising its habits. This is the gift of age, of elders, of long=practiced care for life. -p. 69-70 -q
> Christians are anointed like Jesus, imbued with the spirit of life, o heal the sick, release the captive, feed the hungry, and tase and see the goodness of God in this world. -p. 71 -q
> In early Christian worship practices, those who took part in the Eucharist ritual would touch their eyes and ears and nostrils with fingers dipped in the communion wine. 'Everything belongs to the God of beauty,' -p. 71 -q
> ... the part of theology known as 'soeriology,'... meaning salvation, deliverance, preservation, or release. -p. 78 -q
> That notoriously terse New Englander Calvin Coolidge... -p. 79 -q
> Recently, however, liberals have been in danger of abandoning that attempt, walking away from it, and leaving the Bible and its interpretation to conservates to use patrnalistic and oppressive ways. -p. 79 -q
> Sometimes we need to be reminded that all literature, sacred and profane alike, relies on metaphor. -p. 83 -q
> The most ancient shrine described in the Bible was a rock. -p. 93 -q
> The divine-human encounter is the rock on which our theological house stands. -p. 93 -q
> Rather than submitting to extablished doctrine, human beings could to know God from observation of the world and contemplation of human experience. -p. 96 -q
> Revelaton comes to those who are radically hospitable to what they do not know. -p. 102 -q
> Rooted in science, reason, and intuition, process theology provides a way of understanding the existence o fgod that progressive theology can embrace in the 21st century. -p. 105 -q
> God is a reality... present in each, yet greater than all. -Forrest -p. 107 -q
> The challenge is to not let our hearts be turnd to stone by tragedy but to meld with oen another in a reconstruction of faith of love. -p. 117 -q	
> But, at its best, sexal intimacy can reveal the powers of the soul - our ability to feel and be affected, our capcity for both vulnerability and power, to receive and to give. -p. 131 -q
> I can see that feminist theology is rather like Quakerism: it looks to the authority of our won inner light - our experience - as a basis for religion. -p. 131 -q
> Homo economicus - the economic human - of market capitalism is self-nterested, focused on immediate gratification of wants and needs, and unconcerned with twhat happens to others in the process of getting his needs met. At every turn, the market - the dominant religion of our day - tells us and our children that htis is who we are and who we should be. But this concept of the human being, in fact, diminishes and dehumanizes the fullness of those who humans are and can be. -p. 133 -q
> The challenge for people of faith now is to counter market capitalism's joyless, diminished view of humanities and its lifethreatenng effects on earth's ecoologies. -p. 134 -q
> At the core of authentic religion is the spirit of hospitality. All three Abramic faiths recognize this. the tent of Abraham is open on all four sies o welcome the stranger from anywhere, say the rabbis. The infamous sin of ancient Sodom ws no same-sex love, scholars say, but rather a brutal violation of strangers who should have been treated wih hospitality. -p. 140 -q
> Today, many people say, 'I am spiritual but not religous.' They want to connect more deeply with the Spirit, but they have little confidence that the Spirit is going to show up at a worhship service or religous ritual. They might be right. Even in the bible, the Spirit shows up on mountainops, along roadsides, and in humble homes and rooms moe often than it does in designation places of worhsip, ritual, and assembly. -p. 148 -q
> [The Spirit]is holy because it yearns for harmony, justice, wholeness. -p. 151 -q
> Many other Protestants do not realize how deeply their basic pattern of worship comes from ancient synagogue practice: a prayer of invocation; a psalm chanted (or later a hymn sung, many growing out of psalms); a scriptural reading or two; prayers; a sermon explicating and applying the spiritual wisdom of the scriptures; a final psalm or hymn; and a blessing. -p. 153 -q
> One familiar Christian approach frames outsides as nonbelievers who need to be saved. From this perspective there is only one true household of faith, and the mission of the religious community is to make all outsiders into insiders, to convert and assimilate the Other. Another perspective is possible. A theological house can be a place of hospitality to any who seek its shelter; it can honor religious diversity and wlcome creative exchange among multiple religious practices and perspectives. IT can greet the Other as a holy guest and urge its own residents to venture out to engage with the world. This is the way of progressive faith: An open door stands at the threshold of our theological house, is doorsill well-worn by comings and goings. -p. 164 -q
> The world's various religious traditions can e respected as manifestations of God's life-giving spirit that creates splendid diversity - not uniformity. -p. 169 -q
> People of progressive faith care for the sacredness of this world, this life, here and now. We do not look to a world to come that will be more valuable than this world. -p. 170 -q
> The crucifying powers remain active in the world. Liberal theologian Walter Rauschenbusch named these forces militarism, religious biotry, mob-spirit, greed and economic exploitation, and corruption of justice systems. These are the sins, he said, that killed Jesus. -p. 171 -q
> The mission of progressive faith is to embrace the beauty of diversity and the diversity of beauty; to resist the crucifying powers by ministries of solidarity; to love one another and this earth as paradise, here and now, the place Jesus prmised us we would be when he said, "Today you will be with me in paradise." -p. 172 -q
> The mission of liberal religion is to make religion more liberal and to make liberals moe religious. -Wallace Robbins -p. 175 -q
> But the amazing thing to me about the Unitarian Union of Northease India is that it is not the product of mission work; it is an indigenious movement that looked for partners. -p. 178 -q

> There were two classes of solitaries: anchorites (restricted to a place), and hermits (not restricted. -- Some hermits were caretakers, such as lightkeepers, keepers of highway and bridges, or shrines, or special chaplains (minister to strangers and the poor, and to pray for the people). Many saw them as a sort of prophet or seer. -- Solitaries had 'rules of life', used moreso as 'friendly councel' (p. 89). -- Hermits 'signed a deed of profession, made a vow, and received a charge as to his future manner of living...' (p. 86) -- Solitiaries were typically held to a vegetarian diet -- 'In the realm of romance, the solitary is a teacher, expounder of visions, confessor, counsellor, healer, and host.' (p. 147). -s
> Withdrawal from the world was not at first encouraged by the Christian religion. -p. 13 -q
> Paul of Egypt -- called 'the first hermit'... -p. 13 -q
> It is true that their primary objective in retiring into solitude was the cultivation of the soul, but in doing so they became living witnesses to the reality of the spiritual world. -p. 13 q
> They upheld a lofty and austere moral ideal in the face of self-indulgence, and their manner of llfe was a silent rebuke to rudeness, and excercised a chastening influence in an age of violence. -p. 13 -q
> There were, indeed, two distinct classes of solitaries: the anchorite, enclosed within four walls, and the hermit, who went out of his cell and mingled with his fellow-man. -p. j13 -q
> In some cases anchorites devoted their quiet hours to study, and placed their literary or artistic powers at the service of others. -p. 14 -q
> In fact, the hermits were pioneers of philanthropic works which in these days are undertaken and carried out by public bodies. -p. 15 -q
> ... Wulfric of Haselbury -- prophet and confessor, stern and uncompromising alike with himself and his king... -p. 15 -q

> 4 LIGHTKEEPERS: John Puttock -- Nicholas de Legh -- David Welkes -o
> The Church was the pioneer in many works of mercy and utility, including the provision and maintenance of beacons, bridgets, roads, harbours, and even forts. -49 -q
> 5 HIGHWAY AND BRIDGES HERMITS: Hugh Garth -- Langland -- John le Marechal -- Adam de Whenby
> Some unscrupulous people "took the habit for the sake of an idle life, preferring alms to wages. -61 -q
> The vow of Richard Ludlow... he undertook to have the minister's profession in worship and reverence, to live to his life's end in temperance, soberness, and chastity, to eschew all open spectacles, common scot=ales, tavers, and other suspect places of sin; to hear Mass, pray, and fast; and lastly, he undertook that whatever he should recieve by the way of charity, he would expend truly, without deceit, upon the mending of the bridge and common ways of the town, reserving only sufficent to support himself. -62 -q
> 6 TOWN HERMITS: Thomas de Byreford, Alan Chauns, John "the hermit" (John le Megre?)
> Town-hermits often undertook definite employment [like caretakers of bridges and roads, gates, lepers, or a special chaplain (minister to strangers and the poor, and to pray for the people)]. -p. 71 -q
> 7 ANCHORITES: Wulfric, Lauretta, Katherine of Ledbury, -s
> The anchorite differed from the hermit in that he lived in stricter seclusion, and was not free to wander at will. -p. 73 -q
> Through on window, towards the choir, the recluse partook of the Blessed Sacrament; through another, on the opposite side, he recieved his food; a third, closed with glass or horn, lighted the dwelling. -p. 79 -q
> VII ORDER AND RULE
> The hermit signed a deed of profession, made a vow, and received a charge as to his future manner of living. -p. 86 -q
> The Order of St. Paul the First Hermit -p. 86 -f
> The hermit should make obedience to God alone, because he himself is abbot, prior, and prefect in the cloister of his heart. Episcopal Charge Pontifical, 16th c. -p. 88 -q
> The recluse's Rule of Life consisted of friendly councel rather than rigid regulation. -p. 9 -q
> Rules: Rule of Aelred, Ancren Riwle, Form of Perfect Living / by Richard Rolle, The Scale (or Ladder) of Perfection / by Walter Hilton, Book for Recluses. -q
> The early hermits lived a primitive life as tillers of the soil, and their food consisted of herbs, roots, grain, and fruit... he also kept cows... -p. 101 -q

> Flesh was rarely tasted by the hermit. -p. 102 -q
> The recluse lived on simple foods, chiefly vegetarian. -p. 104 -q
> No man felt himself a hermit until he had assumed some distinctive dress. -p. 105 -q
> To forsake all was the initial step of the hermit's career. -p. 108 -q

> In early days it was customary for the cell to become the tomb of its tenant, whether hermit or anchorite. -p. 113 -q
> X TRIAL AND TEMPTATION
> To learn to suffer, and to suffer well, was one of the chief ambitions of the anchoress. -p. 124 -q
> XII HUMAN INTERCOURSE: A. Companionship in the cell -- B. Intercourse with the world -- C. Constancy of Abode
> The 'solitary' was not condemned to a self-centered and self-sufficing life of utter separation and silence. Companionship was permitted, even  encouraged, on the ground that to live entirely apart from human converse was positively dangerous to the soul... The rules therefore impressed the avisability of fellowship with another of like mind and purpose. -p. 128 -q
> Guthlac formed a group of recluses who were in touch with one another. -p. 128 -q
> Nor did the enclosed person necessarily live alone. Wulfric, for example, seems to have the company of Brichtic (p. 74). Richard de Coupe of Swepestone, priest, and Geoffrey Richard, layman, dwelt together in London in the churchyard of St. Lawrence, Jewry (1367). -p. 130 -q
> Recluses had to avoid the pettiness, suspician, and ill-temper which a narrow life might foster... A spirit of unity was to be cultivated: 'Let your dear faces be always turned to each other with kind affection, a cheerful countenance, adn gentle courtesy'. [Ancren Riwle] -p. 131 -q
> It was customary for the enclosed person to have servants. -p. 131 -q
> Although recluses were permitted to speak at discression, they bore the reputation of being taciturn; 'Little will they speak'. -p. 135 -q
> ... but an anchoress ought to give her thoughts to God only. -Ancren Riwle. -p. 136 -q
> XII PROPHETS AND CONSELLORS
> The hermits and achorites of England occupied an independent position somewhat akin to that of the Hebrew seer... follower of Elijah and John the Baptist. It was therefore hsi vocation to read the signs of the times, to declare, to preach, and, it may be, to predict. -p. 146 -q
> In the realm of romance, the solitary is a teacher, expounder of visions, confessor, counsellor, healer, and host. -p. 147 -q
> Claiming to know the Divine will by special revelation, the recluse often exercised an important influence both in public and private affairs. -p. 155 -q
> XII LITERARY RECLUSES (St. Jerome, Gildas, historian, Cuthbert, Billfrith, Plegmund, Dunstan, Guy (Wido), Wechelen, Godric of Finchale, Simon Stock, hymn-writer, Thomas Scrope, historian, Geoffrey, grammarian, George (or Gregory) Ripley, alchemist, Margery Kemp and Julian, mystics, Richard Rolle, composer of poetry and prose, Symon, compiler of a manual of meditations ("The Fruyte of Redempcyon")
> The solitary, therefore, ought to be learned, not one who needs to be taught; also he aught to be wise and learned in the Divine law, that he may know whnce he may bring forth things new and old. -Grimlaic, Regula Solitariorum (9th c.) -p. 167 -q
> There is a tradition that a a British recluse (Eremita Brytannus), living in the time of Ina, King of Wesses, collected the history of his country, and expecially the deeds of King Arthur. -p. 167 -q
> The eleventh-century chronicler, Osbern, visited [Dunstan's] cell or den, which he describes as being more like a tomb than a human habitation. It seems incredible that it measured only 5 feed by 2 1/2 feet. Tn this narrow dwelling the gifted young solitary studied the Scriptures, transcribed and illimited manuscripts, and even, so it said, practiced various arts, such as casting bells and making organs. -p. 169 -q
> The solitary now belongs to a bygone age... Recluses were swept away by the flood which carried off all that was in any way connected with monasticism... They were not a class composed wholly of eccentric and fanatical, or selfish and morbid persons who shirked the duties of life. They were often men and women of strong and saintly character whose life commanded respect and won gratitude from their fellow-man, who recoognized them as workers. At it's best, the contemplative life was a career and a noble one. -p. 191-2. -q

> The Greek temple has been characterised as a house of the soul, different from the Egyptian temple, which was the house of the god, and the cathedral, the house of the people. -p. 79 -q
> The Rhodians sold the equipment for a large sum of money which they spent on the creation and erection of an enormous bronze statue of their patron deity, Helios he Sun God. The schulptor they chose for the commission [of the Colossus of Rhodes] was Chares of Lindos, a pupil of the famous sculptor Lysipus. Between 294 and 282 BC... -p. 127 -q
> The Museum (a temple of the Muse) was essentially a monastic establishment where scholarship flourished and where accredited scholars were privileged with exemption from taxation and given free board and lodging...

> This book presents a curriculum for information literacy. -s
> People need the skills and values to enable them not just to access information but to use it to make informed judgements and choices, to make their voices heard and make a difference. Librarians have recognized this for many years and call these skills and values ‘information literacy’. -q
> Information-literate people... are judicious citizens who can use information to transform their circumstances, create new knowledge and reach their full potential. -q
> Yet in a world awash with information and knowledge, young people appear increasingly unable to carry out independent research, reluctant to argue and to challenge big ideas and to take risks to discover new knowledge. Instead they readily copy and paste ideas rather than read and critique them. -q
> If librarians are not needed to manage books, perhaps they canevolve into a new role as information literacy experts? -q  I think this exaggerates the situation. Librarians continue to manage books (and other information packets), digital or otherwise. -r
> Libraries have a fundamental role in providing access to information and knowledge, to enable it to be used and communicated to others. In essence, libraries... facilitate learning. Learning enables research and research brings about transformation and progress. -q
> . While librarians may no longer be gatekeepers of knowledge, they can be valuable trusted guides and through information literacy initiatives they can help learners become autonomous and able to make their own informed judgements. -q
> ... we work towards the shared ambition of developing autonomous, lifelong learners who are able to use information effectively in their academic studies and in their personal and professional lives. -q
> The term ‘information literacy’ was first used almost 40 years ago and was coined by Paul Zurkowski, a US librarian (Zurkowski, 1974). -q
> Information literacy empowers people in all walks of life to seek, evaluate, use and create information effectively to achieve their personal, social, occupational and educational goals. It is a basic human right in a digital world and promotes social inclusion in all nations. -q
UNESCO (2005) 
> Information literacy is a continuum of skills, behaviours, approaches and values that it is so deeply entwined with the use of information as to be a fundamental part of learning, scholarship and research. It is the defining characteristics of the discerning scholar, the informed and judicious citizen and the autonomous learner. -q

Emerging in the 13th Century, Mali declined in the 15th Century and came int o an end 100 years later.

> In Ashanti, a novice studied for three years, during which time he was said to be 'married' to the god. The first year he learned the ceremmonial uses of herbs - which leaves to rub on his ankles to strengthen them for dancing; which to rub on his eyes so that he could "see his god daily"; which to take in order to arouse the spirit of possession. During the second year he learned the laws and taboos of the god. He was told never to drink intoxicating liquors, never to gossip, never to quarrel or fight, never to call upon his god to kill anyone, never to attend the chief's court unless invited, never to go at night to join other young men. In addition, he was always to salute his elders by bending his right knee and touching the ground with his right hand. Finally, in his last year, the priest-to-be learned the arts of divination and incantation and the proper forms of addressing his god. -p. 126 -q
> Like other such societies, the Poro was essentially religious. But the broad democracy of its membership, backed by the authority of ancestral sanctions, gave it a srong role in the practical aspects of community life as well. The Poro existed to interpret the will of ancesters, but it also arranged public festivals, settled secular disputes and set market prices for everything from yams to gold. Religion and politics thus went hand in hand. -p. 127 -q

> He [the witch-doctor] was often able to settle disputes between rivals that may have led to voilence, and his knowledge of the medicinal value of herbs frequently led him to prescribe remedies that actually cured. Also, through his intimate knowledge of the lives of the people of in his community, and of human nature in general, it was not unusual for him to fuction as a sort of prescientist psychologist -p. 128 -q

> Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter, by Seth Grahame-Smith. It is a work of fiction, and takes place in the United States in the 18th century. The main characters include Abraham Lincoln, and Henry Sturges.  The story begins with a shopkeeper, Seth Grahame-Smith, who is given a 'secret' diary written by Abraham Lincoln detailing his vampire hunting. The main events of the story include Lincoln's mother's death (who does from the hands of a vampire), his meeting Henry (who saves him after a vampire hunt goes very wrong), his entry into politics (and subsequent surprise that Washington seems teeming with vampires and the friends of vampires), and the civil war. The story ends with Lincolns' death; and Henry in 1963 meeting Martin Luther King Jr.  I would recommend this book to fans of alternative fiction and fantasy.  -p.  -b

> The idea of education has been so tied to schools, universities, and professors that many assume there is no other way, but education is available to anyone without reach of a library, a post office, or even a newsstand. -p. 2 -q
> A great book begins with an idea; a great life, with a determination. -p. 2 -q
> That book or that person who can give me an idea or a new slant on an old idea is my friend. -p. 3 -q
> No mater how much I admire our schools, I know that no university exists that can provide an education; what a university can provide is an outline, to give the learner a direction and guidance. The rest one has to do for oneself. -p. 3 -q
> If I were asked what education should give, I would say it should offer breadth of view, ease of understanding, tolerance for others, and a background from which the mind can explore in any direction. -p. 3 -q
> Historical novels are, without question, the best way of teaching history, for they offer the human stories behind the events and leave the reader with a desire to know more. -p. 7 -q
> Whatever the book, a reader reads. -p. 14 -q
> It is often said that one has but one life to live, but that is nonsense. For one who reads, there is no limit to the number of lives that may be lived... -p. 18 -q
> Education, as I have said, takes many forms and there are many ways to knowledge and awareness. -p. 28 -q
> The difficulty was that few people know what it means to be absolutely alone. Even fewer people know what silence is. Our lives are filled with the comming and going of poeple and vehicles, so much so that our senses scarely notice the sounds. They have become a background to our living, all our thinking, absorved subconsciously. -p. 42 -q
> Often I would take a break, drink coffee, and read. Then, as many times since, Idid not read from one book alone but started several, anxious to get the flavor of each one and reluctant to wait until one was finished before dipping into another. -p. 44 -q
> Questions must be formulated from knowledge and I knew too little for that. I was a young man in a hurry, wanting to know all that had been thought, pondered, speculated upon. -p. 44 -q 
> The loneliness at the mine never affected me, for I had many companions: Hopalong Cassidy, Hamlet, Sancho Panza, and Ulysses were with me. -p. 45 -q
> It was the first of a half-dozen such conversations we had, and each time I learned a little bit. -p. 46 -q
> Personally, I believe children should be taught to see, to observe, and to subject what they have seen to analysis, and this in in the earliest grades. Very young children will often learn a difficult subject easily unless someone tells them it is 'hard'. To me it also seems obvious that a child should be taught some methods of reasoning, methods of scientific investigation. Children have an innate feeling for logic and, given the opportunity, would learn quickly. -p. 74 -q
> We do not at present educate people to think but, rather, to have opinions, and that is something altogether different. Many of the political ideas that have disturbed the world int he past fifty years could not exist in such an atmosphere. -p. 75 -q
> My way was suited to me. I have never been very good at taking instruction. I enjoy lectures, and have attended many, but mostly I prefer the quiet of a library and the freedom to go off in any direction that pleases me. -p. 75 -q
> The armchair adventurer has all the advantages, believe me. -p. 78. -q
> I studied purely for the love of of learning, wanting to know and understand. -p. 75 -q
> I think the greatest gift anyone can give to another is the desire to know, to understand. -p. 78 -q
> Life is for delving, discovering, learning. -p. 78 -q
> One book always led to another and occasionally my discoveries led to a whole succession of books, but there was no intent in my reading except to learn and to know. -p. 83 -q
> There is much violence in the Bible, and the story could have been told in no other way... If we were to eliminate violence from our reading, we would have to eliminate all history, much of the world's drama, as well as the daily newspaper. -p. 84 -q
> A few people reason, but all people feel. -p. 85 -q
> It is not necessary to travel in order to write good stories; it is only necessary to see, to understand, to reveal. -p. 86 -q
> Yet there are exceptions, and to come upon them is always a pleasure. -q -p. 90. REFLECTION: Good phrase.
> I had no friends at first, only aquantances. -p. 88 -q
> My reading followed no pattern. -p. 89 -q
> In the days I speak of, bookstores were usually operated by book lovers. Now they are run by anyone who can ring up a sale. -p. 90 -q
> That, too, was education. I learned that when I was in charge I should keep my eyes open and understand the situation before I move. And I learned i was also risky to break up teams that are used to working together. No matter what is to be gained, much is also lost. -p. 91 -q
> I was by no means a scholar, simply an interested reader with nothing to do but live and learn... -p. 103 -q
> There is an effort now to preserve everything by mechanical means, but of what use will they be to a man who has no power? No means of reproducing the sounds or the words? A book can be carried away and read at leasure. It needs nothing but an eye, a brain, and the ability to read. -p. 104 -q
> In that one year I reviewed twenty-two books. -p. 122 -q
> 'Talent is nothing but long patience.' -p. 124 -q
> I much prefer to dip into them [books] here or there and follow some particular theme. -p. 128 -q
> The world with which Americans must deal in the future will no longer be confined to that small area called Europe, although its importance will continue. We must take heed of India and China, of Pakistan and Southeast Asia. -p. 28 -q
> The key to understanding any people is in its art: its writing, painting, sculpture. -p. 129 -q
> Given paper with which to write and a typewriter, I can be happy anywhere. -p. 130 -q
> I am concerned with people building a nation, learning to live together, with establishing towns, homes, and bridges to the future. -p. 136 -q
> The frontier is that line beyond which man has not been, or where he is only beginning to go. -. 136 -q
> Yet I have ever been a wanderer, drifting through fields of books and finding blossoms wherever they might bloom. -p. 137 -q
> Someone has said that culture is what remains with you after you have forgotten all you have read, and I believe there is much truth in that. -p. 138 -q
> The western pioneers were select people, selected by themselves. They chose to break the mold, to leave all they knew behind and venture into a new country, wiith new problems, new standards. Each one was expected to stand on his own feet. He was moving of his own volition, on his own supprot system. Nobody was paying his way or showing him the way; nobody had told him to go, or where to go. He simply packed what goods he could carry and headed west, looking for what chance might offer. -p. 145 -q
> Ours has been called a materialistic society... but I have never found a society that was not materialistic. If you find one, you may be sure it will by dying. -p. 145 -q
> To me success has meant just two things: a good life for my family, and the money to buy books and continue the education of this wandering man, who has ceased to wander except in his memory, his thoughts, and the books he writes. -p. 145 -q
> Books are precious things, but mmore than that, they are the strong backbone of civilization. They are the thread upon which it all hangs, and they can save us when all else is lost. -p. 146 -q
> Much of the study of history is a matter of comparison, of relating what was happening to one area to wwhat was happening elsewhere, and what has happened in the past. -p. 146 -q  
> Give the brain encouragement from study, from thinking, from visualizing, and no drugs are needed.-p. 154 -q
> Of course, if one is to speak, one must have something worth saying, and say it intelligently. -p. 165 -q
> All young men and women owe it to themselves to be able to write a letter on not more than one page, to set forth an idea or possible plan... no need for details, for if the idea is expressed well, there will be questions, and the details can come later. -p. 165 -q
> Although some of what I wass learning might someday be of use, I was not studying for that purpose, but, again, simply because I wished to know. -p. 168 -q
> Politics is the art of making civilization work. Many young people despise compromise, but without it, the world would come to a standstill. -p. 169 -q
> Those young people of whatever race or nationality who loiter along streets gather in gangs are going nowhere without education and training, but education is there for them now, as it was for me... All that is needed is the will, and the idea. -p. 172 -q
> Most western men were familiar with simple home remedies as well as some Indian treatments. -p. 180 -q
> Books are the building blocks of civilization, for without the written word, a man knows nothing beyond what occurs during his own brief years and, perhaps, in a few tales his parents told him... A parent or teacher has only his own lifetime; a good book can teach forever. -p. 195 -q
> I do not need help; I need time. -p. 197 -q
> The oldest piece of paper in the world was found on the site of the ancient town of Lou-lan, paper dated (it would still be read) A.D. 130. (Paper is said to have been invented in China in 106). -p. 206 -q

> One of the enduring findings of modern scholarship on the New Testament and early Christianity over the past two centuries is that the followers of Jesus, during his life, understood him to be human through and through, not God. People saw Jesus as a teacher, rabbi, and even a prophet. Some people thought of him as the (very human) messiah. -p. 45 -q
> How did an apocalyptic prophet from the backwaters of rural Galilee, crucified for crimes against the state, come to be thought of as equal to the One God Almight, maker of all things How did Jesus - in the minds and hearts of his later followers - come to be God? -p. 45 -q
> Its like what some Episcopalians say about themselves today: get four in a room and you'll find five opinions. So too with ancient Jews. -p. 51 -q
> HENOTHEISM, the view that, while many gods exists, one will 'believe' in only one. -p. 53 -f
> Stoics believed that Logos - reason - was a divine element that infused all of existance... as the mind is to the body, so the Logos is to the world. -p. 73-5 -q
> METHODS: 1) Criterion of independent attestation 2) Criterion of dissimilarity (if a tradition is dissimiliar to what early Christians woudl have to say about Jesus, it is more likely to be historically accurate) 3) Criterion of contextual credibility. -p. 94-8 -f
> MESSIAH, one who is annointed... chosed and specially honored by God. -p. 113 -f
> He [Jesus] thought he was a prophet predicting the end of the current evil age and the future king of Israel in the age to come. -p. 124 -q
> Almost certainly the divine self-claims [of Jesus] in John are not historical. -p. 125 -q
> What we can know with relative certainty about Jesus is that his public ministry and proclamation were not focused on his divinity... They were about God. And about the kingdom that God was going to bring... He believed and taught that he was the future king of the coming kingdom of God, the messiah of God yet to be revealed. -p. 128 -q
> What was it that made Jesus so special?... it was not his message... what made Jesus different from all the others... was the claim that he had been raised from the dead. -p. 131 -q
> The resurrection for Paul is not a spiritual matter unrelated to the body, as it was for some of his opponents. -p. 137 -q
> A standard confession, or creed, quoted: Cor. 15:3-8; Romans 1:3-4; by Luke: Acts 13:32-33, 2:36. -f
> pre-Pauline/pre-literary formulations: 1) fact 2) theological interpretation 3) statement 3) proof (by means of physical evidence). -p. 138-40 -f
> The 'third day' resurrection story is thought to fulfil Hos. 6:2. Ehrman connects it with Matt. 12:39-41 ('the sign of Jonah'), and Jonah 2, as Jonah was in the belly of the fish for three days/nights. -p. 141 -f
> ... Daniel Smith, to suggest that these two sets of traditions - the empty tomb and the appearances of Jesus after his death - probably originated independantly of one another and were put together as a single tradiition only later- for example, in the Gospels of Matthew and Luke. -p. 143 -q
> ... the idea that Jesus rose on the 'third day' was originally a theological construct, not a historical piece of information. -p. 175 -q
> What is certain is that the earliest followers of Jesus believed that Jesus had come back to life, in the body, and that this was a body that had real bodily characteristics [because] some of Jesus's followers had visions of him after he had been crucified. -p. 183 -q
> ... the disciple's belief in the resurrection was based on visionary experiences. I should stress that it was visions, and nothing else, that lead the first disciples to believe in the resurrection. -p. 184 -q
> Contradistinction: Distinction made by contrasting the different qualities of two things #wotd -p. 185 -f
> In Jesus's view, the dead would be raised bodily to face judgement, either to be rewarded if they had sided with God or to be punished if they had aligned themselves with forces of evil. This afterlife in the kingdom would entail a bodily resurrection. -p. 185 -q
> ... visions appear to occur with particular frequency among those who are experiencing bereavement or religious awe and expectation. -p. 195 -q
> Such visions are more commonly experienced when a person has a sence of guilt over some aspect of his or her relationship with the one who has died. -p. 195 -q
> I should stress that the Guggenheims are not trained in psychology or in other fields relevant to the scientific study of visions; therefore, their analysis of their data is not useful for scholarly purposes. -p. 196 -q
> It appears that people who are physically or emotionally exhausted are more likely to have an After-Death Communication. -p. 196 -q
> As apocalyptic Jews, the disciples believed that the afterlife entailed a resurrection of the dead. When they experienced Jesus after he had died, they naturally understood his new life in the light of their own deeply held convictions. He had been bodily raised from the dead. -p. 197 -q
> ... Paul hold to an incarnation [high, v.s. exaltation, i.e. 'low'] Christology. That, in no small measure, is because Paul understood Christ to be an angel who became a human [Gal. 4:14]. -p. 252 -q
> Semitism: the way of righteousness, v.s. the right way; Holy Spirit; v.s. Spirit of holiness. -p. 233 -f
> ... Romans 1:3-4. It appears to be the earliest form of Christian belief: that God exalted Jesus to be his Son by raising him from the dead. -p. 266 -q
> The oldest Christology of all may be found in the preliterary traditions in Paul and the book of Acts, but it is not the view present in any of the Gospels. Instead... the oldest Gospel, Mark, seems to assume that it was at his baptism that jesus became the Son of God; the next Gospels, Matthew and Luke, indicate that Jesus became the Son of god when he was born; and the last Gospel, John, presents Jesus as the Son of God before creation.... [however] the reality is... view of Jesus did not develop along a straight line... -p. 236-7 -q
> Luke is fond of incorporating a variety of prelitary traditions that he had heard, even if they differ from his own view. -p. 240 -q
> ANTICHRIST, 'those opposed to Christ'. -p. 296 -f
> MARCION, m, 2nd c., Roman. -- Founder of MARCIONITES, a docetist docrine. -p. 300 -f
> The orthodox position, as we will see, claimed that both sides of this dispute were right in what they affirmed and wrong in what they denied. -p. 302 -q
> ... Christian Gnostics maintained that salvation came not through faith in the death and resurrection of jesus, but through proper 'knowledge' of the secrets Christ revealed to his followers. -p. 303 -q
> PRECOCIOUS: appearing or developing early. #wotd -p. 315 -f
> SYSTEMATIC THOLOGY: 'methodical attempt to deal with the major theological views of the church. -p. 316 -q 
> And even though they said the traditional Christian Creeds as part of their worship services, many of these people did not believe what they said - as I learned from talking with them. -p. 323 -q
> 'We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ' Again, why say there is one of him... Here, too, it is because Gnostic Christians were sayign that Christ was several beings, or at least two: a divine being and a human being who were only temporarily united. -p. 324 -q
> ... liberal and open churches... -p. 325 -q
> For me... not being able to say the (rest of the) creed... prevents me from joinng such congregations. ... event clergy - often tell me that this should not be an obsticle. A lot of them don't believe it either! At least not in any literal way. -p. 325 -q
> For the church leaders who formulated them, not only the very basic literal meaning of these statements mattered (God exists; Christ is his Son; he was God; but he became a human; he died for others and rose from the dead; etc.); the deeper nuances mattered as well - every word was to be taken as literally true and important, and contrary statements were to be rejected as both heretical and dangerous. -p. 326 -q
> With respect to Christology... it was concluded that Christ was a sepaarate being from God the Father, who had always existed alongside God, whowas equal with God and always had beenequal with God, who became a human, not in part, but completely, while not abandoning his status and power as God. -p.326 -q
> In the end, the orthodox settled for the paradox of the Trinity: there are three persons, all of whom are God, but there is only one God. One God, manifest in three persons, who are distinct in number but united in essence. -p. 329 -q
> Christianity was far more focused on 'theological truth' than traditional Greek or Roman religions and palced greater emphasis on 'sacrificial practice'. -p. 348 -q
> If Constantine did not much like the controversy of his own day, he would have despised what was to come. -p. 351 -q

>Whether the courts should base decisions on “originalism” is a political, not a historical, question.
>Ambiguity creates possibilities.
>Principles which we all thought to have been firmly and permanently settled,” Frederick Douglass observed, were “boldly assaulted and overthrown.”
>The historian Linda Colley has observed that written constitutions often function as “weapons of control” rather than “documents of liberation and rights.”
>constitution should not be construed as denying to any citizens the privileges and immunities to which they were entitled,
>As Alexis de Tocqueville observed, a passion for equality animated American democracy. But the concept of equality before the law—something enjoyed by all persons regardless of social status—barely existed before the Civil War.

>Before Reconstruction the federal government played almost no role in defining or protecting Americans’ rights.
>Colored Convention” movement,
>Frederick Douglass, after several years of adhering to the Garrisonian position, changed his mind and declared the Constitution “a glorious liberty document.” “I am for strict construction,” he declared, and the word “slavery” could not be found in the Constitution’s text. Nor did it contain language allowing for “discrimination in favor of, or against, any class of people.”
>Free Soil party
>barring slavery’s expansion into the territories, the issue that brought on the Civil War—
>And the abolitionist critique of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, which provided that the status of an accused runaway would be determined by a federal commissioner, not a jury, and that the alleged fugitive could not testify in his or her own behalf, led to the elevation of “due process of law” as essential to equitable judicial proceedings.
>made the federal government for the first time what Sumner called “the custodian of freedom.”
>During the conflict, Lincoln felt obligated to stretch constitutional authority to its limits and beyond.
>Roughly 150 amendments to resolve the secession crisis were proposed during the winter of 1860–61.
>He did not share the abolitionists’ commitment to ending slavery immediately nor their belief that free
>blacks and emancipated slaves should become equal members of American society.
>Women’s Loyal National League, founded in 1863. For the time being women activists suspended the movement for woman suffrage to press for an end to slavery, the route, they believed, to blacks and white women obtaining their “rights and privileges as free and equal citizens of a common republic.”
>Kentucky also refused. The place of Lincoln’s birth would have the distinction of being the only state to reject the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments. It finally decided to ratify them in 1976.
>Along with the right to “personal liberty,” declared another, the “right of a husband to his wife” and of a “father to his child” comprised the “three great fundamental natural rights of human society.” The amendment was intended to restore these rights, not undermine them.42
>For decades, those who would later become Radical Republicans had defended the unpopular causes of black suffrage and equal citizenship.
>Another option was to base representation on voters, not total population, as Stevens had proposed.
>“the wildest fancy of a distempered brain”
>Congressman Giles Hotchkiss of New York,
>THE LAST-MINUTE ADDITION of a definition of American citizenship constitutionalized the principle that virtually every person born in the country is a citizen, regardless of race, national origin, or the political affiliation or legal status of one’s parents. Today, the United States stands almost alone among industrialized nations in this;
>birthright citizenship, with which the Fourteenth Amendment begins, remains an eloquent statement about the nature of American society,
>The first sentence of the Fourteenth Amendment also marked a radical change in the role of black women within American society. As slaves, they gave birth to property; now their children were citizens of the nation, rather than economic assets of white southerners.
>“Due process” suggests procedural fairness, not substantive rights.
>The Declaration of Independence contained the stirring words “all men are created equal,” a radical pronouncement at a time when most countries were ruled by monarchs and hereditary aristocrats.
>The Fourteenth Amendment for the first time elevates equality to a constitutional right of all Americans. It makes the Constitution a vehicle through which aggrieved groups and individuals who believe that they are being denied equality can take their claims to court.
>“A true republic,” said William Windom, a Republican congressman from Minnesota, “rests upon the absolute equality of rights of the whole people, high and low, rich and poor, white and black.”
>In the context of the violence sweeping the postwar South, the word “protection” in the Fourteenth Amendment conjured up not simply unequal laws but personal safety.

>State control of voting qualifications, claimed Senator Oliver P. Morton of Indiana, was a relic of state sovereignty, the frame of mind that had produced secession.
>“The whole fallacy,” said Morton, “lies in denying our nationality. I assert that we are one people and not thirty-seven different peoples; that we are one nation, and as such we have provided for ourselves a national Constitution.”
>John A. Bingham, the key author of the Fourteenth Amendment,
>The eleventh former Confederate state, Tennessee, rejected the amendment in 1869; it would ratify it in 1997.
>“crack brained harlequin and semi-lunatic,”
>Nonetheless, over time, the Court played a crucial role in the long retreat from the ideals of Reconstruction.
>Increasingly, the Court construed the Fourteenth Amendment as a vehicle for protecting corporate rights rather than those of the former slaves, striking down state regulations of working conditions and railroad rates on the grounds that they violated “freedom of contract” protected under the Due Process Clause.

>culminating in decisions of the Warren Court during the Second Reconstruction of the 1950s and 1960s,
>The state, for example, required a photo ID to vote and then closed driver’s license offices—where such documents can be obtained—in counties with the highest percentage of blacks in the population.

> Rather, they [people drawn to Quakerism] have found its focus on the inner life to be an antidote to the complexities and challenges of modern life. The Quaker values, what we call testimonies -- simplicity, peace, integrity, community, and equality -- offer an ethical and spiritual platform upon which people can happily build their lives. -p. 4 -q
> ... it confirmed what had become a growing desire on their part: to live a liberated life, freed from multiple distractions. I suspect the word Simplify on their wall was their initial movement toward a more meaningful life. p. 27 -q
> When the essayist Anna Quindlen quoted a postcard she'd receive, 'If you win the rat race, you're still just a rat,' we knew what she meant. -p. 28 -q
> There are, they saying goes, two ways to be rich: one is to make more, the other is to want less. -p. 30 -q
> At the heart of simplicity are found several essential values: awareness, generosity, patience, persistence, and focus. -p. 33 -q
> When new clothing is purchases at rock-bottom prices, somewhere in the world a laborer is being exploited. -p. 35 -q
> John Woolman believed the root of war began in our quest for more. -p. 37 -q
> I am not speaking of the financial prosperity we are promised by televangelists when we donate to their cause. That is manipulation of the worst sort, exploiting the naive for selfish gain. -p. 42 -q
> We are distracted beings in an agitated world. -p. 47 -q
> Much of our time there [an isolated farmhouse] is spent reading, hiking in the woods..., or tending to the home and flower gardens... Board games take the place of video games and television, and home-cooked meals replace fast food. -p. 48 -q
> Never in the history of the world has communication been so easy and simultaneously so distracting and pointless. -p. 50 -q
> This is the beginning of intentional living, our dawning realization that life can be simpler, less cluttered with demands and obligations we find increasingly meaningless. -p. 50 -q
> This is the key to true wealth: not only learning to live with less but also learning to want less. -p. 57 -q
> Glee at the suffering of another is surely symptomatic of a troubled spirit. -p. 60 -q
> But brutality on behalf of God and country is still brutality, and though it has been made to seem virtuous, it is as morally repugnant as violence born of self-interest. -p. 61 -q
> When thirty-seven cents of every United States tax dollar is spent on past and current warfare, while only two cents of every tax dollar is spent on diplomacy, international assistance, and war prevention, one could reasonably conclude the United States is suffering from a collective psychosis. -p. 61 -q
> By spiritual, I mean not only one's orientation to a Divine Being but also one's recognition of and appreciation for the inherent worth of their follow humans. -p. 61 -q
> For the seeds of violence are rooted in our desire to change and manipulate another, inevitably through coercion, which first violates the will and spirit of another, then does violence to his or her body. -p. 62 -q
> There are varying reasons for this [continued violence in spite of working for peace], chief among them humanity's tendency to believe certain types of agression will end all violence, which is magical thinking and has never proven to be the case. -p. 62 -q
> Long before the first punch is thrown or the first gun is fired comes the effort to compel another to do our bidding... a form of voilence meant to violate another's will or conscience -p. 65, 67 -q
> We have created a world designed to punish or marginalize persons who question or reject our culture's assumptions and values. p. 65 -q
> ... the ultimate powerless of coercion. Once our deepest fears have been met and overcome, we enjoy a power and a freedom we have not known before. Too often we have been silenced or cowed by fear fears of retrobution. But when we act, we discover our fears were overblown, and we are no longer held hostage by treats of retaliation. It is then we can begin living life powerfully and purposefully, living the prophetic lives God has called us to live... a prophetic witness against evil. -p. 66 -q
> This might be the greatest temptation for those of us who are religious: the tendency to confuse our personal hopes for God's will... p. 67-8 -q
> Hatred does not have to be based on logic or actual circumstances. In fact, it usually isn't. We only have to believe someone poses a treat to us to justify his or her demise. -p. 69 -q
> ...coercion is the start of violence... -p. 69 -q
> This shared Divine Presence brings us together, then binds us together, enabling us to care for one another. The alternative is tribalism and its jealous gods, whereby distinctions are forever drawn, suspiciouss raised, and boundaries guarded. This has been our past. It cannot be our future. -p. 75 -q
> But we have armed ourselves far beyond the actual threat posed by others, chiefly because we habe been persuaded the dangers we face is so significant we have no choice but to dedicate most of our resources to war and the preparation for it. -p. 79 -q
> Religion, when grounded in an ethos of grace, forgiveness, and reconciliation, can be a powerful tool in the struggle for peace. -p. 83 -q
> This inward lack of trust breeds outward suspicion, generates ill will, and makes peace all the more unlikely. -p. 94 -q
> What must be healed is the hateful though, the intolerant rhetoric, the laws that demean. -p. 85 -q
> Three children in the United States died from lawn darts, which led to their ban in 1988. But 1,500 to 2,000 children under the age of seventeen are shot to death each year, and manufacture of weaponry continues unabated. -p. 90 -q
> The peace Jesus leaves us is the capacity to forgive, the potential for reconciliation, and the example for determined grace. -p. 93 -q
> Whenever the leaders of a nation use violence against their own peopel or their neighors, we must hold them criminally liable for their misdeeds, no matter their position or nationality. Violence is as contagious as any germ and to allow it to grow unchecked in one nation is to ensure it's rapid spread to others. -p. 94 -q
> Cooperation, mutual responsibility, and selflessness are essential among nations as they are among families -p. 94 -q
> I wish for them what I wish for all people: a life of peace and joy, unthreatened by hatred and discord. -p. 96 -q
> Quakers believed their credible witness to the gospel depended upon their reputation, that if they were dishonest in human affairs, they couldn't be trusted to speak truthfully about God. -p. 100 -q
> I also understood that in matters of integrety it was better to go the extra mile than to fall short, for reputations, once tarnished, are difficult to restore. -p. 102 -q
> Just as Friends valued simplicity in dress, so too was their speech unadorned. They believed flowery speech intended to impress or curry favor was inhearently dishonest, so they spok to the king as they did the commoner. -p. 105 -q
> They believed shoddy work was a sin and reflected poorly on their witness to God. -p. 106 -q
> Woolman visited the native Indians, hoping to "recieve some instruction from them.' -p. 110 -q
> But Quakers believe God and truth are synonymous, that to find one is to discover the other. p. 110 -q
> In that sense, they are not anti-sacramental, but omni-sacramental; they believe all of live can and does point to God. -p. 110 -q
> Propaganda seeks to covert the unbeliever, while truth seeks to hear them out. -p. 114 -q
> The therapist helped me understand that I was responsible for my own feelings, responsible for my choices, and responsible for my reactions to others. -p. 115 -q
> The queries are a series of self-directed questions we employ to evaluate our emotional, spiritual, and relational health... the point of the queries is simple: to encourage honest self-evaluation in light of our Quaker values and priorities. -p. 118-9 -q
> To say a person has integrity means several things. Most commonly, we mean the person is honest, that his or her word can be trusted... But there is another level of meaning that has to do with integration of our values and lifestyle... this integration is critical for inward peace. Without it, we experience a split-mindedness, a separation between who we wish to be and who we are. -p. 121 -q
> CLOSTRIDIUM BOTULINUM TOXIN: 'the most powerful and potent substances known to mankind... one teaspoon is enough to kill millions of people' -p. 131 -f
> GEORGE FOX, m, founder of Quakerism. -p. 141 -f
> The best clerks [of a Quaker meeting] can make all feel heard and valued, while weaving the disparate elements into a unified and motivated whole. -p. 142 -q
> Consensus helps the hard feelings that often accompany voting. -p. 142 -q
> We are slower to speak and more apt to listen and solicit the view of others. The spirit is one of cooperation, not contention. -p. 143 -q
> This was my mother's mantra, ever present through my childhood: 'What if everyone did that?' -p. 144 -q
> To be a Quaker is to always understand yourself and your actions in terms of the world. It is an invitation to reflect, not siimply react, to keep before you the question, What would the world be like if everyone did what I am doing? -p. 145 -q
> Community was the safeguard against destructive behavior and the corrective against selfishness. -p. 146 -q
> The Quaker William Penn observed that 'true religion does not draw men out of the world but enables them to live better in it and excites their endeavors to mend it.' -p. 148 -q
> I can think of no nobler and more vital work for the church to undertake than the building of healthy communities which differences are appreciated and not feared, where past truths are honored and emerging wisdom encouraged. -p. 155 -q

> ... the usual British pattern: first, say something won't happen and then, when it does, saying it's going to be a failure and then, when it's a success, desperately trying to catch up. -p. -q
> CH. 8: The Chapter BRITISH OUTSIDER IN EUROPE begins with Hain's responsibilities in Europe as a negotiator for British interests. As a pro-European, he worked to change Britain's image as hostile to Europe. While forging personal relationships, he made little progress. The events in this chapter include the negotiations and politics of the Euro, and the Gibraltar co-soverenty referrendum (that failed specacularly) -p. -s
> Ch.8: This begins with Hain as a foreign office minister. Points include dealing with other government departments, and with civil servants, advocacy for 'complementary' (alternative) medicine (also called 'integrated healthcare' in the book), his rather muted admiration of the queen and royal family (Hains' background is as a republican), unguarded remarks he made to the press about tax policy, and reflections of the state (bad state, according to Hain) of journalism, or investigative journalism. Hain seems to take great pride in actually not taking advice from the civil service, and forcing his will upon officials and departments. This is viewed as true leadership. He also shows distress when the press digs into the politics of a story rather than the story. One wonders what the press is to do. While saying that the press doesn't pay attention to serious, intelligent information and true debate. Yet when they do, Hain says they become part of the story. One also wonders what is virtuous with not listen to what is usually well-informed and cautious advice from his officials. -p. -s

> Elected parliaments, habeas corpus, free contract, equality before the law, open markets, an unrestricted press, the right to proselytize for any religion, jury trials: these things are not somehow the natural condition of an advanced socity.

> On formal occasions, men in most countries dress as Englishmen; the rest of the time they dress, for the most part, as Americans, in jeans. -p. 10 -q
> The pamphleteer [of the principles of the Whigs before the Glorious Revolution]... lawmakers should be directly accountable through the ballot box; the executive should be controlled by the legislature; taxes should not be levied, nor laws passed, without popular consent; the individual should be free from arbitrary punishment or confiscation; decisions should be taken as closely as possible to the people they affect; power should be dispersed; no one, not even the head of state, should be above the law; property rights should be secure; disputes should be arbitrated by independent magistrates; freedom of speech, religion, and assembly should be guaranteed.

> The day after Paul Revere's ride, April 19, 1775, the first shots were fired in what most contemporaries took to be the second English Civil War - a continuation, in many ways, of the first. No one at that stage thought of the conflict as being between two distinct nations... a war that had pitted Whig against Tory rather than American against Briton. -p. 49 -q

> Characteristics of Anglo-Saxon common law: the 'law of the land' (rather than the law of god, the king, etc) -- emphasis on private ownership and free contract -- everything not expressly prohibited is legal -- the invigilation of the law is everyone's business ('The policeman is a citizen in uniform, not an agent of the state') -- need for a tribunal to determine it  (the legislature, and jury (?) ). -p. 79-80. -o

> Capitalism harnesses greed to socially productive ends. -p. 143 -q

> "There is a contract and a bargain made between the King and his people, and you oath is taken: and certainly, Sir, the bod is reciprocal." -John Bradshaw -p. 152 -q
> Laudians wanted to remove the emphasis from the sermon and restore it to the communion. It was, they beleived, presumptuous for worshippers to seek to understand God. Congregations were there, rather, to adore Him, and the service should be designed to highlight the mystery of faith, with the clergyman returning to the role of mediator or intercessor. Hence the importance of beautiful surroundings, stained glass windows, candles, glorious vestments. -p. 160 -q
> Liberty, in Milton's mind, did not mean an absence of rules: this he called "License," and heartily disliked. Liberty, rather, meant the freedom that comees from the virtuous and informed excersise of independant judgement... 'Where there is much desire to learn, here of necessity will be much arguing, much writing, many opinions; for opinion in good men is but knowledge in the making.' -p. 180 -q

> In James II, it is hard to find any qualities at all. He was dull-witted, sly, bigoted, self-pitying, humorless, obstinate, and cowardly. -p. 188 -q
> The Glorious Revolution was the moment when the Anglosphere took off, developing into a small-goverment, individualist, mercantile state-system. -p. 193 -q
> Ever since the Glorious Revolution, it has been tacitly undeerstood that the British might hire and fire their kings just as they might hire and fire their MPs. -p. 193 -q

> ... the Grand Union Flag. Known also as the Congress Flag and the Continental Colors, it had the thirteen red and white stripes as they are today, but in the top left-hand quarter, instead of stars, it showed Britain's flag, made up of St. George's Cross for England and the St. Andrew's Cross for Scotland. -p. 213 -q

> Many Native Americans, for example, fought for the Crown, seeing it as an ally against land-hungry settlers. -p. 231 -q
> The British saw themselves as being set apart by unique institutions: a sovereigh parliament, the common law, secure property rights, an independent judiciary, armed forces that were subordinate to the civil authorities, Protestantism, and, above all, personal freedom. -p. 255 -q
> ... from at least the sevententh century, there had been two broad political tendencies in the English-Speaking world. One emphasized individualism, representative democracy, and Anglosphere exceptionalism and, for the sake of abbeviation, may be labeled Whig - though that title was not always used by its partisans. The other emphasised stability, hierarchy, and order, and might - again, sometimes anachronistically - be labeled Tory. - p. 267 -q
> Black South Africans saw Afrikaans as a language of oppression, English as a language of opportunity. -p. 281 -q
> It cannot be stressed too often: the institution [of slavery] existed in every age, in every society, on every continent. What distinguishes the English-speaking nations was not that they practiced slavery, but that they crusted it. -p. 286 -q
> On the eve of the American Civil War, there were three thousand black slave owners in the United States. -p. 287 -q
> In the settler colonies, the places with large British-descended populations that form the core Anglosphere today, indigenous peoples were eventually given an effective choice between assimilation or life on protected reservations. -p. 290 -q Hardly a choice!

> The miracles of the past three and a half centuries -- the unprecedented improvements in democracy, in longevity, in freedom, in literacy, in calorie intake, in infant survival rates, in height, in equality of opportunity -- came about largely because of the individualist market system developed in the Anglosphere. -p. 312 -q

> The resulting thesis, titled <i>The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism</i>, argued that there was indeed such a correlation [between captialism and Protestantism], and that its cause lay in the peculiarly Protestant idea that idustry and thrift were godly virtues. Until then, Weber argued, Christians had sought to renounce worldly things: to be ascetic, to despise wealth, to overcome desire. But Puritans believed that money, honestly acquired through hard work, was a sign of divine favor. -p. 322 -q

> The chimpanzees are the closest. Just 6 million years ago, a single female ape had two daughters. One became the ancestor of all chimpanzees, and the other is our own grandmother. -p. 5 -q
> The more eastern regions of Asia were populated by Homo erectus. 'Upright Man', who survived there for close to 2 million years, making it the most durabe human species ever. This record is unlig\kely to be broken even by our own species. It is douhtful whether Homo sapiens will still be around a thousand years fro nw, so 2 milion years is really out of our leaue. -p. 6 -q
> This unique species, known by scientists as homo floresiensis, reached a maximum height of only 3.5 feet and weighed no more than fifty-five pounds. -p. 7 -q
> In Homo sapiens, the brain accounts for about 2-3 per cent of total body weight, but it consumes 25 percent of the body's enegy when the body is at rest. -p. 9 -q
> Women paid extra. An upright gait eqired hnarrower hips, constricted the birth canal - and this just when babies' heads where getting biger and bigger... Natural selection concsequently favoured earlier births... Human babies are helpless, dependent for many years on their edlers for sustenance, protection and education... It takes a tribe to raise a human. Evolution thus favoured those capable of forming striong social ties. In addition, since humans are born underdeveloped, they can be educated and socialized to a far greater extent than any other animal. -p. 10 -q
> One of the most common uses of early stone tools was to crack open bones in order to get to the marrow. Some researchers believe this was our original niche... This is a key to understanding our history and psychology. -p. 11 -q
> By about 300,000 years ago, Homo erectus, Neanderthals and the freathes of Homo sapiens were using fire on a daily basis... The advent of cooking enabled humans to eat more kinds of food, to devote less time to eating, and to make do with smaller teeth and shorter intestines... When humns domesticated fire, they gained control of an obedient and potentially limitless force. -p. 13 -q
> We don't know exactly where and when animals that can be classified as Homo sapien first evolved from some earlier type of humans, but most scientists agree that by 150,000 years ago, East Africa was populated by Sapins that looked just like us. -p. 14 -q
> Achaeologists have discovered the bones of Neanderthals who lived for many years with severe physical handicaps, evidence that they were cared for by their relatives. -p. 14 -q
> It turned out that 1-4 per cent of the unique human DNA of modern populations in the Middle East and Europe is Neanderthal DNA. -p. 16 -q
> Tolerance is not a Sapiens trademark. In modern times, a small ifference in skin colour, dialect or religion has been enough to prompt one group of Sapiens to set about exterminating another group. -p. 18 -q
> Perhaps this is exactly why our ancestors wiped out the Neanderthals. They were too familiar to ignore, but too different to tolerate. -p. 18 -q
> The last dwarf=like humans vanished from Flores Island about 12,000 years ago. -p. 19 -q
> ... Homo sapiens conquered the world thans above all to its unque language. -p. 19 -q
> The Cognitive Revolution. -p. 21 -q
> Our language evolved as a way of gossiping. -p. 22 -q
> Sociological research has shown that maximum 'natural' size of a group bonded by gossip is about 150 individuals. Most people can neither intimately know, nore gossip effectively about, more than 150 human beings. -p. 17 -q
> How did Homo spiens manage to cross this critical threshold, eventually founding cities comprising tens of thousands of inhabitants and empires ruling hundreds of millions? The secret was probably the appearance of fiction. Large numbers of strangers can cooperate successfully by believing in common myths. -p. 27 -q
> Peple easily understand that 'primitives' cement their social order by believing in ghosts and spirits, and gathering each full moon to dance together around the campfire. What we fail to appreciate is that our odern institutions function on exactly the same basis. -p. 28 -q
> According to the French legislators, if a certified lawyer followed all the proper litugy and rituals, wrote all the required spells ad oaths on a wonderfully decorated pience of paper, and affixed his ornate signature to the bottom of the document, then hocus pocus - a new company incorperated... Once the lawyer had performed all the right rituals and pronounced all the necessary spells and oaths, millions of upright French citizens behaved as if the Peugeot company really existed. -p. 31 -q
> The kinds of things that peopel create through this network of stories are known in academic circles as 'fictions', 'social constructs', or 'imagined ralities'. -p. 31 -q
> ... Sapiens have been able to change their behaviour quickly, transmitting new behaviours to future enerations without any need of genetic or environmental change. -p. 34
> Chinese eunuch bureaucracies. -f -p. 34. Research this -r
> The immense diversity of imagined realities that Sapiens invented, and the resulting diversity of behaviour pattrns, are the main components of what we call 'cultures'. -p. 37 -q
> There's hardly an activity, a belief, or even an emotion that is not mediated by objects of our own devising. -p. 43 -q
> Ever since the Cognitive Revolution, ther ehasn't been a single natural way of life for Sapiens. There are only cultural choices, from among a bewildering palette of possibilities. -p. 45 -q
> There was just one exception to this geeral rule: the dog. The dog was the first animal domesticated by Homo sapiens, and this occured before the Agricultural Revolution... Dogs were used for hunting and fighting, and as an alarm system against wild beasts and human intruders.... A 15,000-year bond has yielded a uch deeper understanding and affection between humans and dogs than between humans and any other animal. -p. 46 -q
> Trade was mostly limited to prestige items such as shells, amber and pigments. -. 46 -q
> During the last million years, there has been an ice age on average of every 100,000 years. The last one ran from about 75,000 to 15,000 years ago.	66	q
> The second explanation is that by the time Sapiens reached Australia, they had already mastered fire agriculture. Faced with an alien and threatening environment, it seems that they deliberately burned vast areas of impassable thickets and dense forests to create open grasslands, which attracted more easily hunted game, and were better suited to their needs. They thereby completely changed the ecology of large parts of Australia within a few short millennia.	68	q
> ... hunting and fire agriculture...	68	q
> The first Americans arrived on foot, which they could do because, at the time, sa levels were low enough that a land bridge connected north-eastern Siberia with north-western Alaska.	69	q
> According to current estimates, within a short interval, North america lost thirty-four out of its forty-seven genera of large mammals.	71	q
> At the time of the Agricultral Revolution, only about a hundred[large terrestrial mammals] remained. Homo sapiens drove to extinction about half of the planet's big beasts long before humans invented the wheel, writing, or iron tools.	72	q

> PUBLIUS CORNELIUS TACITUS, m, roman, 
> MARCUS TULLIUS CICERO, m, Roman, 2nd c. -Statesman and philosopher. -f
> We owe to Cicero a very moden conception of the dignitas of each individual... in short, the foundations of humanism and the liberal tradition in social and political thought. -p. 58 -q
> We must give our country 'the largest and most numerous portions of our loyalty, ability, and sagacity, leaving to us for our private use only what might be surplus to its needs.' -p. 65 -q
> The philosopher, in his retirement, can 'share the company... of the greatest minds by enjoying their discoveries and writings'... -p. 65 -q
> Cicero's conception of justice... stresses respect for life, liberty, and property... they are guaranteed and protected by the ideal constitution. they recognize and defend the dignitas, the fundamental moral worth, of each individual. -p. 67 -q
> Aistotle had catalogued the three pure types of state (monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy) and their three depraved counterparts (tyranny, oligarchy, and mob rule). He argued that each pure type tends to degenerate into its opposite... He therefore advocated a mixed consitution... -p. 67 -q
> Natural law, Cicero explains, is 'right reason in harmony with nature.' -p. 70 -q
> For cicero, duty comes under four headings (derived from the four Greek virtues, but with a decidedly Roman twist): wisdom (prudentia), justice (justitia), courage (fortitude), and temperance (temperantia). -p. 72 -q
> This idea of being true to one's own nature is very modern and un-Roman. Two millennia later, it would become Nietzsche's ultimate injunction: 'Become who you are!' -p. 74 -q
> Cicero agrees with both Hellenistic schools, however, that 'the whole aim of philosophy is to lead us to a happy life'... As such, philosophy builds character and self-sufficiency, allowing us to 'face all of ife with equanimity.' -p. 75 -q
> EPICUREANISM: founded by Epicurus, stressed 1) pleasue, not virtue, is the highest good, 'peace of mind (ataraxia) and the absence of pain above all things'. 2) 'as a natural consequence of the first point, he urged his disciples to withdraw from any political involvement in favor of a quiet life and contemplation and retirement'. -p. 75 -f
> We must free ourselves from the prison of everyday affairs and politics' - Cicero -p. 75 -q
> As Cicero told his son, 'we must decide who and what we wish to be, and what kind of life we want.' -p. 76 -q
> Wise men are 'entirely self-sufficent,' and 'nothing that there is the slightest possibility of eventually losing can be regarded as an ingredient of the happy life.' -p. 77 -q
> Cicero, as always, occupies a more balanced, middle ground [between Stocism and Epicureanism]. -p. 77 -q
> Cicero thus disputes the standard Roman idea of amicitia, friendship based on mutual services and support. -p. 78 -q
> ... 'the best education for the situations of actual life cosists of the experience we acquire from the study of serious history.' -Polybius. -p. 248
> Ever-growing riches made Rome soft; avariis 'taught men haughtiness, cruelty, to neglect the gods, to regard everything for sale.' -Sallust -p. 252. -q
> 'The historian's task is not to thrill or charm but 'to record with fidelity what actually happened and was said, however coonplace this may be.' -Polybius. -p. 248 -q
> Polybius carefully describes the elements of kingship (the consuls), aristocracy (the Senate), and democracy (the popular assembly), and the inticate relations among them. -p. 249 -q
> 'It is a special duty of history to see tht virtues are not left unrecorded, and also that fear of disgrace in posterity attends iniquitous words and actions.' A crucial part of the historan''s taks, then is to assign praise and blae, t extol where he can and condemn where he must. -p. 246 -q
> He [Livy] writes of 'good citizens and noble deeds' and celebrates the constellation of virtues - patriotism, courage, loyalty, self-sacrifice, piety, and austerity - that was the foundation of Rome's greatness. -p. 254 -q
> AGRICOLA, m, Roman, 1st c. Served as governor of Britain, following consulship in 77. -p. 257 -q
> Integrity is dangerous in an absolutist state... at best, Tacitus suggests, one can serve the state competently, nurture a quiet conscience, and bide one's time. -p. 265 -q
> EPICTETUS, m, Roman, 1st c. -- Author of _Discourses_. -f
> The central tenant of Epictetus's philosphy is that we must distinquish between those things within our control and those outside of our control. Within our control are our values, desires, and volitions. Outside of our control all those things that men lust after in this life but that depend on chance and circumstance. The stoic finds his resources and his happiness within himself and directs his wishes accordingly. With regard to everything else, he says with Socrates, 'If god so pleases, so be it.' -p. 272 -q
> ... Epictetus, who argued that we can never be free until we learn to limit our desires to the sphere of matters within our control... -p. 272 -q
> Marcus recognized that the greatest enemy of each of us is within and that our constant daily battle is to vanquish vain disires and forlorn hopes in order to achieve peace and tranquility and a new form of freedom and joy is accepting divine providence and serving our fellow men. -p. 272 -q
> ARRIAN, m, Roman, 1st c. -- Historian, Consul, military commander. Author of _Anabasis_ of Alexander. -p. 273 -f
> But freedom for Epictetus is achieved not through the satisfactionof desire but through the suppression of desire for things that lie outside of our control. -p. 275 -q
> ... we don't control events; we control only how we react and respond to events... if you choose the latter course, Epictetus tells us, you will find a new freedom and inner peace and willl nto expend psychic energy blaming others... if we do not... we will livei nconstnt fear, anxietyy, pain, and distress... -p. 276 -q
> For Epictetus, the autonomous self has three components: judgement, desire/aversion, and volition or choice. -p. 278 -q
> We choose the peace and tranquility of our souls over attempts to control external events... by letting go of whatt lies outside of our control, we find happiness, serenity, and an untroubled mind. -p. 278-9 -q
> ... although the Stoic sage treats externals with indifference, he does not view his relationships with others as externals, but rather as fundamental aspects of his own humanity. And those relationships may engender positive emotions of love, gratitude, and affection. -p. 279 -q
> That is one of Stoicism's harshest lessons: 'no good man laments, nor sighs, nor groans.' -p. 280 -q
> According to Stoic doctrine generally, and Epictetus in particular, the universe is governed by an all-wise, all-good divinity.-p. 280 -q
> If god equals nature, if the divinity is immanent rather than transcendant, then much of the religious overlay of Stoicism simply disappears... God becomes a trope for the preternaturals mystery, beauty, wonder, and order of the natural world. -p. 281 -q
> 'My formula for greatness in a human being is amor fati: that one wants nothing to be different, not forward, not backward, not in all eternity. Not mearly bear what is necessary, still less conceal it - all idealism is medaciousness in the face of what is necessary - but love it. -p. 282 -q
> Keep the prospect of death and loss always before your mind, he [Epictetus] advises. Then nothing will seem terrible to you. -p. 283 -q
> MARCUS AURELIUS, m, Roman, 1st c. -- Emperor of Rome; writing of his _Meditations_. -p. 284 -q
> The rules of life on which Marcus rings changes are few but fundamental: 'a pious acceptance of the day's happenings, a just dealing towards the day's associates, and a scrupulous attention of the day's impressions'. They correspond to the tthree disciplines of Epictetus - assent and judgement; desire and aversion; inclinatiion and action... these 'three disciples of life'... The man who practices and lives these three disciples will be wise, moderate, pious, and loving in all things. Most important, he will live live freely and fully in the present. -p. 286 -q
> R.B. Rutherford notes 'the unique note of unhappiness and disillusionment that permeates the Meditations'.-p. 287 -q
> The basic moral teaching [beliving in a personal v.s. deist god] is the same; we can will our conformity with circumstance. -p. 288 -q
> These interined convictions - divine prpovidence and the brotherhood of man - are the two premises of his {Marcus Aurelius] life. From them he derives a litany of virtues that he praises throughout the Meditations: courtesy, piety, serenity, generosity, simplicity, love, duty, justice, industriousness, charity, kindliness, and unselfconscious diginity. -p. 290 -q
> 'Life is short', Marcus warns, 'and this early existence has but a single fruit to yield - holiness within and selfless action without.' -p. 291 -q

> But solitude was his [Nietzsche] essential lot and indeed the essential condition in which his books were forged. He was a man without wife or children, without a job or a home, without a country, and without a church. He was, perhaps, as thoroughly alone as it is possible to be. -p. 18 -q

> The contents [of BEING AND TIME] would have given her [Heidegger's mother] little consolation; the book argues that confronting the nothingness and inevitability of death is what gives authenticity to life. -p. 206 -q
> Heidegger wants to recapture a sense of wonder and astonishment at the sheer Being of beings, at the fact that there is something rather than nothing. That sense of wonder should not be dissipated in false and nonsensical explanations about the grounds and essence of Being. the fact of existence, in the midst of the possibility of nothingness, is itself what is so astonishing. -p. 211 -q

Black articians had repeatedly led revolts to overturn slavery... Jefferson could not be expected to look beyond the conventions he feared from the presence of free blacks everywhere in the South to envision a future when a flight of blacks to cities reduced the role of rural slavery and thus not only increase the resilience of yeoman agrarianism but also provided urban markets close by. -p. 53-4 -q
