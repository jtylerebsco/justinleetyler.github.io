<p class="rubric">The Celebrant may say</p>

<p>Holy and beautiful the custom which brings us together [in the presence of the Most High]: To face our ideas, to remember our loved ones in absence, to give thanks, to make confession, to offer forgiveness, to be enlightened, and to be strenthened. Through this quiet hour breathes the worship of ages, the cathedral music of history. Three unseen guests attend, Faith, Hope and Love. Let our our hearts prepare them place. <em>Robert French Leavens.</em></p>

<p class="rubric">When appointed, the following hymn or some other song <br/>
sung or said, all standing</p>

<p>Gloria!Spirit of life, you who breathe     life into the world,you who bless the sea     with ships and     quicken the fruitful earth,since through you all living     things are conceivedand, risen, gaze upon the light     of day,through seas and hills,     through tearing floods,through the    leafy homes of birds,through lush green fields,we give thanks.</p>

<p class="rubric">On other occasions the following is used</p>

<p>Lord, have mercy.The sea is so great     and my ship is so small.Lord, have mercy.The stars are far away,     and the night is cold.Lord, have mercy.My life is short,     and we hunger for hope.Lord, have mercy.</p>


<p id="The Collect of the Day"><strong>Chalice Lighting</strong></p>

<p> Eternal Spirit, whom we call God, you are our life. You are the best and most beautiful in us and beyond us. Your spirit is in animals, birds, plants, and in people whom we do not know or who seem very different from us. All of us share the gift of life. Help us to remember that life is good. Help us to know that we don't stop loving people or other living things when they are no longer close to us. Love lasts always. May we look for ways to love one another, and to love all living things. Amen. (Licinda Steven Duncan) </p>

<p class="rubric">The Celebrant says to the people</p>

<p class="rubric">The Celebrant says these or other words, and lights the chalice.</p>

<p>Glory be to the earth and the wind. Glory be to the sun and the rain. Glory be to animals and children and women and men, Glory be to our holy flame which calls us together as one.</p>

<p id="The Lessons"><strong>The Readings</strong></p>

<p class="rubric">The people sit. One or two Readings, as appointed, are said,<br/>
the Reader first saying</p>

<p>A Reading from&nbsp;<u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u>.</p>

<p class="rubric">A citation giving chapter and verse may be added.<br/>

<p><span class="rubric">After each Reading, the Reader may say </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here ends the Reading.</p>

<p class="rubric">Silence may follow<br/>
<br/>
A Psalm, hymn, or anthem may follow each Reading.<br/>

<br/>
<p id="The Sermon"><strong>The Sermon</strong></p>

<br/>
<p class="rubric">On Sundays and other Major Services there follows, all standing</p>

<p id="The Nicene Creed"><strong>The Creed</strong></p>

<p>What do I know of the world?What does a fish know of water?What knows a bird of the air?Nothing but weather,    nothing but waves.Nothing comes from nothing;I am born from the earth, from air     and fire, from water and stars.And my life, which I owe to nature,     being mortal,    I shall return to the earth.I believe in spirit,    breathing upon the waters.I believe in lovingkindness.I believe in life.</p>

<br/>
<p id="The Prayers of the People"><strong>The Prayers of the People</strong></p>

<p>Spirit of Community, in which we share and find strength and common purpose, we turn our minds and hearts toward one another seeking to bring into our circle of concern all who need our love and support: those who are ill, those who are in pain, either in body or in spirit, those who are lonely, those who have been wronged. [Here, people may say the names of those to be remembered]. We are part of a web of life that makes us one with all humanity, one with all the universe. We are grateful for the miracle of consciousness that we share, the consciousness that gives us the power to remember, to love, to care. Amen. </p>

<br/>
<p id="Confession of Sin"><strong>Confession of Sin</strong></p>

<p class="rubric">A Confession of Sin is said here if it has not been said earlier. On <br/>
occasion, the Confession may be omitted.<br/>

<p class="rubric">The minister says</p>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.</p>

<p class="rubric">Silence may be kept.<br/>
<br/>
Minister and People</p>

<p>
<br>The years of all of us are short, our lives precarious.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our days and nights go hurrying on and there is scarcely time to do the little that we might.
<br>Yet we find time for bitterness, for petty treason and evasion.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can we do to stretch our hearts enough to lose their littleness?
<br>Here we are - all of us - all upon this planet, bound together in a common destiny,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Living our lives between the briefness of the daylight and the dark.
<br>Kindred in this, each lighted by the same precarious, flickering flame of life, how does it happen that we are not kindred in all things else?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How strange and foolish are the walls of separation that divide us!
<br>(A. Powell Davies)

<p id="The Peace"><strong>The Peace</strong></p>

<p class="rubric">All stand. The Celebrant says to the people</p>

<table class="vrtable">
	<tr>
		<td class="vrpeople">&nbsp;</td>
		<td>Peace be with you.</td>

		<td class="vrpeople">People</td>
		<td>And also with you.</td>

<p class="rubric">Then the Ministers and People may greet one another<br/></p>

<p class="rubric">Then the service continues with either the eucharist, or the flower communion. If there is no eucharist or flower communion, all that is appointed through the Confession. A hymn or anthem may then be sung, and the offerings of the people received. The service may then conclude with either a benediction, or with the exchange of the Peace.<br/></p>
