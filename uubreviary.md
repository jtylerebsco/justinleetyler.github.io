A Unitarian Universalist Breviary               
===

Being a Unitarian Universalist, and needing an active contemplative life, I wrote a series of prayer bead, devotional, and canodical hour rites for my use. I make my breviary public, and offer it to you for your use. Since freedom and respect of belief is a basic principle of the Unitarian Universalist faith, you are welcome customize it in the way you must to seek and listen to the holy in your life. If you choose to use it, then I would love to hear from you ([\[emailÂ protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection))! Peace, Justin

An Order of Worship for a Chalice-lighting
---

All stand, and the Officiant greets the people with these words.  

_Officiant:_Rise up, o Flame, by thy light glowing  
_People:_ Show to us vision, beauty, and joy

One of the following, or some other introduction or short quote appropriate to the occasion or to the season, may then be read  

Holy and beautiful the custom which brings us together \[in the presence of the Most High\]: To face our ideals, to remember our loved ones in absence, to give thanks, to make confession, to offer forgiveness, to be enlightened, and to be strenthened. Through this quiet hour breathes the worship of ages, the cathedral music of history. Three unseen guests attend, Faith, Hope and Love. Let our our hearts prepare them place. Robert French Leavens

The Officiant, together with the people, then says these words, or some other suitable words

Glory be to the earth and the wind.  
Glory be to the sun and the rain.  
Glory be to animals and children and women and men,  
Glory be to our holy flame which calls us together as one.

The chalice is now lit, as are other candles and lamps as may be convenient. During the chalice-lighting, an appropriate anthem or responsive reading may be sung, or silence kept. The following hymn, or a metrical version of it, or some other hymn, is then sung

Come, come, whoever you are  
Wonderer, Worshiper, lover of leaving  
Ours is no fellowship of despair,  
Come, yet again come.  

The people sit. The service may then continue in any of the following ways:  
With a devotion, beginning with the responsive reading  
With the usual Sunday Service, beginning after the chalice lighting.  
\* Or, it may be followed by a meal or other activity, in which case hymn may be followed by the Prayer of Jesus and a grace or blessing;

Daily Devotions for use in Unitarian Circles
---

These devotions follow the basic structure of the ancient Daily Office of the Christian Church.  
When more than one person is present, the Reading and the Benediction should be read by one person, and the other parts said in unison, or in some other convenient manner.  
For convenience, liturgical texts are provided in each service. When desired, however, other words may be used instead.

_In the morning_

For the sun and the dawn which we did not create  
    For the moon and the evening which we did not make;  
For food which we plant but cannot grow;  
    For friends and loved ones we have not earned and cannot buy;  
For this gathered company which welcomes us as we are, from wherever we have come;  
    For all our free churches that keep us human and encourage us in our quest for beauty, truth, and love;  
For all things which come to us as gifts of being from sources beyond ourselves;  
    Gifts of life and love and friendship. We lift our hearts in thanks this day.  
(Richard M. Fewkes)

_At noon_ Why should we live in such a hurry and waste of life?  
    We are determined to be starved before we are hungry.  
I wish to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life.  
    I wish to learn what life has to teach, and not, when I come to die, discover that I have not lived.  
I do not wish to live what is not life, living is so dear,  
    Nor do I wish to practice resignation, unless it is quite necessary.  
I wish to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life,  
    I want to cut a broad swath, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms.  
If it proves to be mean, then to get he whole and genuine meanness of it, and publish its meanness to the world;  
    Or if it is sublime, to know it by experience, and to be able to give a true account of it.  
(Henry David Thoreau)

_In the evening_ I am glad I came into this world able to think and reason  
    I am glad I came into this world able to feel pain and pleasure, sorry and joy, anger and love.  
I am glad I am able to heal, both physically and mentally able to be aware, to grow and to change.  
    I am glad I am able to respond to love, beauty and truth: able to discern reality, face it, accept it.  
I am glad I came into this world able to feel with others, to care for others.  
    I am glad I came into this world unique and singular.  
I am glad I came into this world as an unfinished creature, moving towards completion.  
    I give thanks for the many gifts of life. I am glad I came into this world.  
(Margorie Montgomery)

A doxology is always sung or said at the conclusion of the entire portion of the responsive reading  

From all that dwell below the sky;  
    Let songs of hope with love arise;  
Let beauty truth, and good be sung;  
    Through every land by every tongue.

_A Reading_  

Our unitarian heritage calls us to recognize the inherent good in all persons, while the universal part of our tradition encourages us to extend love and acceptance to all people. from, "Welcome: A Unitarian Universalist Primer"

A hymn may be used.

Spirit of Life, come unto me.  
    Sing in my heart all the stirings of compassion.  
Blow in the wind, rise in the sea;  
    move in the land, giving life the shape of justice.  
Roots hold me close; wings set me free.  
    Spirit of Life, come to me, come to me.

A covenant may be said.

Love is the doctrine of this church,  
The quest of truth is its sacrament,  
And service is its prayer.  
To dwell together in peace,  
To seek knowledge of freedom,  
To serve human need,To the end that all souls shall grow into harmony with the Divine --  
Thus do we covenant with each other and with God.  
(James Vila Blake)

Prayers for ourselves and others may follow. In the evening, it is appropriate that prayers of thanksgiving for the blessings of the day, and penitence for our sins, be included.

Spirit of Community, in which we share and find strength and common purpose, we turn our minds and hearts toward one another seeking to bring into our circle of concern all who need our love and support: those who are ill, those who are in pain, either in body or in spirit, those who are lonely, those who have been wronged. \[Here, people may say the names of those to be remembered\]. We are part of a web of life that makes us one with all humanity, one with all the universe. We are grateful for the miracle of consciousness that we share, the consciousness that gives us the power to remember, to love, to care. Amen.

_Confession_

The years of all of us are short, our lives precarious.  
    Our days and nights go hurrying on and there is scarcely time to do the little that we might.  
Yet we find time for bitterness, for petty treason and evasion.  
    What can we do to stretch our hearts enough to lose their littleness?  
Here we are - all of us - all upon this planet, bound together in a common destiny,  
    Living our lives between the briefness of the daylight and the dark.  
Kindred in this, each lighted by the same precarious, flickering flame of life, how does it happen that we are not kindred in all things else?  
    How strange and foolish are the walls of separation that divide us!  
(A. Powell Davies)

_Thanksgiving_

For the expanding grandeur of Creation, worlds known and unknown, galaxies beyond galaxies, filling us with awe and challenging our imaginations.  
    We give thanks this day.  
For this fragile planet earth, its times and tides, its sunsets and seasons.  
    We give thanks this day.  
For the joy of human life, its wonders and surprises, its hopes and achievements.  
    We give thanks this day.  
For the human community, our common past and future hope, our oneness transcending all separation, our capacity to work for peace and justice in the midst of hostility and oppression.  
    We give thanks this day.  
For high hopes and noble causes, for faith without fanaticism, for understanding of views not shared.  
    We give thanks this day.  
For all who have labored and suffered for a fairer world, who have lived so that others might live in dignity and freedom.  
    We give thanks this day.  
For human liberty and sacred rites; for opportunities to change and grow, to affirm and choose.  
    We give thanks this day. We pray that we may live not by our fears but by our hopes, not by our words but by our deeds.  
(O. Eugene Pickett)

_The Prayer of Jesus_

Form One: Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy Name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory, now and forever. Amen.

Form Two: Oh thou, whose kingdom is within, may all thy names by hallowed. May no one of them be turned against the others to divide those who address thee. May thy presence be made known to us in mercy, beauty, love, and justice. May thy kingdom come to be in the life of all humankind. May it come with peace, with sharing, and in a near time. Give us this day our daily bread, free from all envy and alienation, broken and blessed in the sharing. Keep us from trespass against others, and from the feeling that others are trespassing against us. Forgive us more than we have forgiven. Deliver us from being tempted by lesser things to be heedless of the one great thing: the give of thyself in us. -Jacob Trapp

Form Three: Eternal Spirit, whom we call God, you are our life. You are the best and most beautiful in us and beyond us. Your spirit is in animals, birds, plants, and in people whom we do not know or who seem very different from us. All of us share the gift of life. Help us to remember that life is good. Help us to know that we don't stop loving people or other living things when they are no longer close to us. Love lasts always. May we look for ways to love one another, and to love all living things. Amen. (Licinda Steven Duncan)

_The Benediction_

May the light around us guide our footsteps, and hold us fast to the best and most righteous that we seek.  
Let us seek to remember the wholeness of our lives, the weaving of light and shadow in this great and astonishing dance in which we move.  
May the darkness around us nurture our dreams, and give us rest so that we may give ourselves to the work of our world. _Amen._ (Kathleen McTigue)

Universal Mystery, guide us away from the desire to shine light in all the corners. Teach us to embrace the night, for without the darkness, we never see the stars. _Amen._
