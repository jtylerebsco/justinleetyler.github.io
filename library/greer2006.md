This is an altogether admirable bookthat wears its
author’s considerable scholarship lightly. A valuable edition to
any collection of books on the history of Druidry and espe-
cially the modern druidic revival, it goes far beyond this in
being both a deeply spiritual and eminently practical book.
—JOHNMATTHEWS,AUTHOR OF SECRETS OF THEDRUIDS ”
A LIVING TRADITION of nature spirituality rooted in Celtic antiquity and
revived to meet the challenges of contemporary life, Druidry offers a path of har-
mony through reconnection with the green Earth. The Druidry Handbook is a
hands-on manual of traditional British Druid practice. Explore the Sun Path of
seasonal celebration, the Moon Path of meditation, and the Earth Path of living
in harmony with nature—all tools for crafting an earth-honoring life here and
now. From ritual and meditation to nature awareness and ecological action, John
Michael Greer opens the door to a spirituality rooted in the living earth with a
mix of philosophy, rituals, spiritual practices, and lifestyle issues.

In this book, with great clarity, Greer performs
alchemy. He discovers and articulates the gold that lies
hidden within the obscure texts of the Revival Druids, and
succeeds with consummate skill in offering a perspective
that redeems much of modern Druidry—revealing it to be
a heritage around which we can grow and build a vital and
dynamic spirituality.

A WORK OFALCHEMY

```
When you die, only three things will remain of you, since you will abandon all
material things on the threshold of the Otherworld: what you have taught to oth-
ers, what you have created with your hands, and how much love you have spread.
So learn more and more in order to teach wise, long-lasting values. Work more
and more to leave to the world things of great beauty. And Love, love, love people
around you for the light of Love heals everything.
FRENCHDRUIDTRIAD, FRANÇOISBOURILLON

THE STORY OF DRUIDISM CAN BE DIVIDED INTOthree
phases: the ancient Druids, who left only traces of their teachings; the
Revival Druids of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, who left
behind a great deal of literature; and modern-day Druids, who from
the mid-twentieth century onward have developed Druidry into one of
the leading alternative spiritualities in the world today.
Modern Druidry has faced considerable difficulty establishing itself
as a valid and viable spirituality. Critics have suggested that its two ear-
lier manifestations are fatally flawed as sources. The amount of mate-
rial inherited from the ancient Druids is minimal, and the material
inherited from the Revival Druids is often spurious and incomprehen-
```

```
THEDRUIDRYHANDBOOK
```
```
sible. Despite these difficulties, contemporary followers of Druidry
have managed to find inspiration and guidance in both these sources.
In fact, they have realized that, to a great extent, a spirituality that
works is one that is made rather than simply found.
Born, as we are, into a consumer culture, we may long for a ready-
made spirituality—one that is fixed and “pure.” Any study of the his-
tory of religion and spirituality shows, however, that even apparently
revealed religions are actually made up of a number of strands of influ-
ence that continue to change to keep the spiritual tradition vital and
not succumb to the arteriosclerosis of fundamentalism.
It has been fashionable, particularly in the United States, to dismiss
the entire period of Revival Druidry as an aberration best forgotten.
The flamboyant and witty author of Real Magic , Isaac Bonewits, once
Archdruid of the ADF, the largest Druid group in America, refers to
the three phases of Druidism as palaeopagan , mesopagan , and neopagan.
He believes that todays’ neopagan Druids must reject the mesopagan
(Revival) period altogether, and instead attempt to research and
restore as much of palaeopagan Druidry as possible. A similar
approach is taken by Celtic Reconstructionism, a movement also orig-
inating in the United States, that likewise rejects the contributions of
Revival Druidry.
Bonewits’s and the reconstructionists’ arguments are convincing.
Much of Revival Druidry attempts to reconcile Druidry with
Christianity. Moreover, much of it is based on the work of Iolo
Morganwg, which, although originally presented to the world as
authentic ancient teachings, was subsequently discovered to derive
from manuscripts forged by Iolo himself.
We reject aspects of our past, however, at our own peril.The search
for an authentic Druidry that rejects Revival Druidry altogether
makes a threefold error. First, it assumes that all of Iolo’s contribu-
tions were generated in his own mind, when the evidence suggests
```
```
x
```
druidry_i-xiv_1-274.qxd 11/29/05 11:14 AM Page x


```
that he may well have gathered scraps of authentic lore that he wove
into the fabric of his creations. Second, it condemns Iolo’s contribu-
tions and the writings of all Revival Druids simply because they may
have been created in recent times rather than in the ancient past, when
we know that age is not a determinant of value or wisdom. Third, it
rejects all Revival Druidry because some of its proponents, and most
particularly Iolo, lied about the provenance of their offerings, when
we know that it is a curious feature in the history of spiritual move-
ments that personal creativity and inspiration, which can be valuable
and helpful to others, is often misrepresented as deriving from
ancient, and therefore more authoritative, sources. European
occultists of the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth centuries
seemed particularly prone to this misrepresentation: the early histo-
ries of Theosophy, the Golden Dawn, Wicca, and some of the
Rosicrucian movements spring to mind. Similarly, there are those who
falsely claim authority by flaunting bogus doctorates.
The consequence of this threefold error is that, despite the prob-
lems presented by Revival Druidry, reconstructionism remains the
bastion of a minority, while the forms of contemporary Druidism that
flourish in the world today include the Revival as one of their sources
of inspiration. Why is this? What is there of value in its teachings?
We must look to America for the answer. Revival Druidry was sus-
tained in America; it was lambasted in America; and now it is being
redeemed in America. The greatest collection of literature in the
world on Revival Druidry is housed in the New York City Public
Library. For a decade or more, Bonewits on the East Coast and the
reconstructionists on the West, have dismissed Revival Druidry as an
aberration. Now, from a peaceful valley in Oregon, John Michael
Greer has taken on the task of redeeming it.
Alchemy is the art of revealing the gold that lies concealed within
apparently valueless matter. In this book, Greer performs alchemy. He

texts of the Revival Druids. In what amounts to a master stroke, he

without a great deal of help from other people in the Druid commu-
nity. Special thanks must go first to Philip Carr-Gomm, Chosen Chief
of the Order of Bards Ovates and Druids (OBOD), for his constant
friendship and encouragement, for the Foreword to this book, and for
making possible a research trip to British Druid archives in the sum-
mer of 2003.The Order’s Patroness, Dwina Gibbs-Murphy; its Scribe,
Stephanie Carr-Gomm; its Archivist, Gordon Cooper; and many other
members of the Order in Britain helped make that research trip, and
my involvement in OBOD generally, a memorable and inspiring expe-
rience. My deepest thanks to them all.
My introduction to the world of modern Druidry came by way of
Clann na Mara Intire, the OBOD seed group in Seattle. Thanks are
owed here to Corby Ingold, Mark O’Kelly, Louise Candage, and Bob
and Roxanne Duniway. My Druid studies led me to the Druid fellow-
ship Ar nDraiocht Fein (ADF), whose extraordinary community of
scholars and practitioners taught me to expand my sense of the tradi-
tion and deepen my knowledge of its historical and spiritual dimen-
sions. Robert Barton, Ian Corrigan, Todd Covert, Erik Dutton,
Robert “Skip” Ellison, Jenni Hunt, David and Toby Kling, Jeremy
Mallory, Ceisiwr Serith, and many other past and present ADF mem-
bers helped expand this dimension of my Druid journey. The
Whiteoak online Druid community also taught me important lessons:

Rebecca Terrill, and many other people on the Whiteoak list shared
their knowledge and insights freely.
In the Ancient Order of Druids in America (AODA), Archdruid
John Gilbert was instrumental in bringing me into the Order and giv-
ing me the opportunity to contribute to it, as an Archdruid of the
Grand Grove and as Grand Archdruid. I also owe thanks to Rev. Betty
Reeves, Past Grand Archdruid, and to all the members of the Grand
Grove and the AODA for their insights and their support. Special
thanks go to Cathy Aurand, Patrick and Mary Claflin, and all the mem-
bers of the Tir na Rogue Druid community in Medford, Oregon, for
their hospitality, encouragement, and support.
The first draft of this book was read by Philip Carr-Gomm, Gordon
Cooper, and John Gilbert. Their comments helped me clarify and
improve the material and its presentation in more ways than I can
count. Of course, all remaining flaws are my responsibility alone.
Finally, thanks go to my fellow Druid, traveling companion, and
source of inspiration, my wife Sara, who was involved in this book at
every stage, from first conception to final proofs.This book is dedicated
to her.

INTRODUCTION

A DRUIDRY FORTODAY

##### WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE A DRUID TODAY?

It’s a valid question, and this book will try to answer it. It’s also a con-
troversial question that raises challenging issues at the intersection of
spirituality, history, and myth. To the world of conventional scholar-
ship, modern Druidry is an oxymoron, for Druids are a thing of the
past—the extinct priesthood of a barbarian culture relevant only to
specialists. To the mainstream religions and philosophies of the West,
modern Druidry is an absurd anachronism—a cult that turns its back
on progress and the modern world to embrace an archaic reverence
for trees and stones.
Yet for more than three centuries, the image of the Druid has
haunted the imagination of the Western world, offering a vision of
humanity as children and students of the living Earth—not her adver-
saries and would-be conquerors. That vision has long challenged con-
ventional ideas of progress, learning, and religion. Literature, poetry,
music, art, protest, social criticism, and alternate visions of history
have often raised the Druidry of old as a banner in the face of dogmat-
ic religion and spiritually barren materialism.Yet the most powerful of
these challenges are crafted by people who take the ancient Druids as
a living example and follow a Druid path in the midst of the modern
world.


THEDRUIDRYHANDBOOK

These modern Druids draw inspiration from ancient Celtic wisdom
traditions, but their traditions have not come down from the Druids of
old. Instead, they accept and celebrate their heritage as part of a mod-
ern spiritual movement open to growth, change, and new insights,
rooted in the green Earth and embracing the contributions of many
peoples and times. Modern Druids learn from ancient teachings, the
developing tradition of modern Druidry itself and the ever-changing
lessons of the living Earth. They embrace an experiential spirituality
and forsake rigid belief systems for disciplines of inner development
and personal contact with the realms of nature and spirit.
Many people today yearn for a way of life in harmony with the
green Earth, a spirituality that celebrates nature, and a vision of the
future more honest and hopeful than the bleak realities of the present
and the tawdry plastic Utopias promoted by advertising and political
and economic parties. Sometimes this yearning leads to attempts to
reject modern life in favor of an idealized past seen through the rose-
colored glasses of romantic fantasy, but such efforts lead nowhere.
What’s needed in the crisis of the present age is a path that brings
nature and spirit together in the here and now, in the world we actu-
ally inhabit. What’s needed is a spirituality that offers effective tools
and practical guidance for the hard, but necessary, task of transform-
ing ourselves and our world.
Druidry offers such a path. It isn’t a panacea for the world’s prob-
lems. As with any spiritual tradition, its potential varies with the
capacities of the very human individuals who practice and teach it.
Still, as a living tradition of nature spirituality, it has much to offer the
modern individual and the modern world.
This book addresses those who are dipping a tentative toe in the
clear waters of the Druid tradition, those plunging into its depths
headfirst, and those who fall somewhere in between. Its focus is expe-
riential, personal, and practical. Like much of Druid wisdom, it
unfolds in three parts. Part I, _A Quest for Ancient Springs: The Druid_


_Tradition in the Modern World_ , outlines the history of the modern Druid
movement and explores the context of Druidry as a contemporary
spiritual path. Part II, _The Wisdom of the Stone Circle: Nine Druid Concepts_ ,
covers some of the core symbols and teachings of Druid philosophy
and provides material for the meditation exercises central to Druidry
as a living path. Part III, _The Ways of the Sacred Grove: Initiation into the
Druid Tradition_ , presents the central themes of Druid practice—move-
ment toward a life in harmony with the Earth, celebration of nature’s
cycles and powers through seasonal rituals, and the development of
body and mind through meditation. It discusses the three central
facets of Druid training: the Earth Path of nature awareness and natu-
ral living, the Sun Path of seasonal celebration, and the Moon Path of
meditation. Those who feel themselves called to follow the Druid’s
path can use this material as a starting point for their own journeys
into the green realms of today’s Druidry.
Like every living spiritual tradition, Druidry grows and changes
constantly. Indeed, different branches of the movement have devel-
oped unique approaches. Druid orthodoxy is very nearly a contradic-
tion in terms. Ask three Druids the same question, a common joke has
it, and you’ll get at least six different answers. Nothing in this or any
other book on Druidry should be treated as infallible or taken on faith.
The only source of Druid teachings that deserves such reverence is the
world of nature itself.

#### How to Use This Book

Those who know the flowing complexity of the Druid tradition won’t
be surprised to learn that this book can be read in several different
ways. People come to Druidry and books on Druidry from many

```

```

THEDRUIDRYHANDBOOK

directions, and their paths through this book will vary accordingly.
For those who are curious about Druidry but don’t yet know much
about it, or who are trying to decide if the Druid tradition speaks to
them, the best approach is to read through the book from front to
back. The history of the modern Druid tradition covered in Part I
offers a good introduction to Druidry as a living spiritual movement,
since nearly all the themes of the modern tradition have deep roots in
the past. The symbolism and cosomology presented in Part II gives a
glimpse into the deeper philosophy of the tradition, while the practi-
cal material in Part III takes its meaning from the play of historical
change and timeless wisdom framed by the first two parts.
For those who already know they want to follow the Druid path,
on the other hand, the opening section of Part III is the best place to
start. Though it has an extraordinary history and a wealth of lore and
philosophy, Druidry isn’t primarily an intellectual path. Its core is
experiential and best reached through the practice of nature aware-
ness, seasonal celebration, and meditation. Part III describes these
practices. The traditional Druid methods of meditation require some
familiarity with the lore presented in Part II, however, and readers
with practical work in mind should study this material next. The his-
torical perspectives in Part I have less to offer the Druid-in-training,
although the history of the Druid movement has important lessons to
offer Druids today.
Those who are following a Druid path as part of a Druid order may
use this book in yet a different way. It contains the core elements of
the Druid tradition and is designed for use by solitary students as a sys-
tem of Druid training. However, it’s also the main textbook for the
Druid Apprentice study program of the Ancient Order of Druids in
America (AODA), a traditional Druid order I head as Grand
Archdruid. An Afterword offers information about AODA and its
course of study for those who are interested in exploring Druidry fur-
ther.


#### The Path of Initiation

Today, the term “initiation” has come to mean a formal ritual marking
the beginning of a spiritual path. Many Druid organizations have ritu-
als of initiation—in fact, sometimes several of them, for different
grades or levels. Some orders require the efforts of a Druid grove with
trained members, while others include rituals for self-initiation in their
instructional coursework. The Ancient Order of Druids in America
falls into both camps; it confers its three degrees either in an AODA
grove or in solitary ritual form.
Since this book is meant to be useful to Druids whether or not they
choose to belong to a Druid order, it outlines a different path. Too
many people forget that the word “initiation” simply means “begin-
ning.” They mistakenly assume that the simple act of passing through
an initiation ceremony by itself makes them Druids. Records of
ancient Druid schools, where some students spent twenty years mas-
tering the Druid curriculum, provide a useful corrective to this sort
of thinking.
In a broader sense, becoming a Druid is a lifelong work. Initiating
yourself as a Druid involves reshaping your relationship to the Earth,
to the spiritual powers of nature, and to yourself. A year of practice
with the basic skills of the Druid tradition is a good starting point. If
you choose to follow the Druid way outlined in this book, you can
begin your initiation by celebrating one of the Druid holy days (see
chapter 8), and end it at the same holy day a year later. Before you
begin, read and thoroughly review the material on each of the three
paths given in Part III. Be ready to start at least one other part of your
Druid training that same day and proceed from there.
During your initiatory year, keep track of your Druid experiences
and practices in a journal; any convenient notebook will do. Keeping
a Druid journal is a useful way to track your progress and can be a

```
INTRODUCTION
```

THEDRUIDRYHANDBOOK

source of perspective. Bring it up to date each day if at all possible, and
review it at intervals. If you decide to pursue Druid initiation and
study in the Ancient Order of Druids in America, your journal will
also give you the raw material for your first-degree examination.
The time and effort required to work through your initiatory year
aren’t excessive. The Moon Path (see chapter 9) starts out with just
ten minutes of meditation two or three times a week, increasing to
twenty or thirty minutes daily by the end of the year. Two or three
hours a week are enough for the other paths, with an additional hour
or so for each of the Druid holy days.Turning off the television for half
an hour each night or setting the alarm thirty minutes earlier each
morning can free up more than enough time to complete all the mate-
rial in this book with room to spare.
Still, a year of Druid practice is a test as well as an initiation. After
a few days or weeks of solitary practice, the glamor of “being a Druid”
can start to wear thin. The Earth Path described in chapter 7 makes
life somewhat less convenient; the Sun Path described in chapter 8
may involve awkward scheduling; the Moon Path described in chapter
9 can be tiresome and frustrating at times. All three demand patience
and a willingness to learn from your mistakes. You can always find
good excuses to skip practices, and plenty of other things can seem
more important than Druid training on any given day. You must face
these discomforts and excuses and make a choice between the roman-
tic image of Druidry and the harder, but more rewarding, realities of
Druidry as a living spiritual path. Put another way, the choice is
between being a Druid and actually becoming one.
This is an important choice; it can’t be forced and it can’t be faked.
If you find that your interest in Druidry stops where the hard work of
Druidry begins, it’s best to realize that, accept it, and do something
else with your time. On the other hand, you may find that living the
Druid way makes you feel as if you are finding your way back to a
home you never knew you had. Many Druids share this experience.


For them, despite the occasional difficulties and frustrations of the
journey, the process of learning Druidry becomes an adventure unlike
any other.

the answers. Druidry is a different kind of spirituality,

however, and its history tells a different tale. It doesn’t

claim to have all the answers—in fact, it’s much more

interested in asking questions—and it didn’t start with a

revelation. It started with a quest.

For thousands of years the British have inhabited a

land shaped by ancient hands. Tall stones loom out of the

grass, alone or in patterns. Long barrows and round bar-

rows mark the skyline or rise in the middle of pastures

and fields. Odd customs linger around some of these, pre-

served by habit or a vague sense that ill luck will follow if

they are neglected. Living close to the shapes of the land

and the echoes of tradition for countless generations,

country folk in the seventeenth century came barely to

see them at all.

When the gentleman scholar John Aubrey rode up to

the little Wiltshire village of Avebury on a cold January

```

THEDRUIDRYHANDBOOK

day at the beginning of 1649, he had no idea that he was about to enter
the greatest surviving temple of prehistoric Europe. Locals knew that
hundreds of massive stones lay scattered across Avebury’s fields, but the
broader pattern they formed—a vast triple circle inside a bank and
ditch of gigantic scale—lay hidden in plain sight by its sheer size.
Familiar with Stonehenge, a day’s hard ride to the south, and fascinated
with the lore and legends of the English countryside, Aubrey saw
meaning where others noticed only large inconvenient stones. He
later commented that Avebury “did as much excell Stoneheng, as a
Cathedral does a Parish church.”^1
Aubrey was a new kind of scholar, poised between the fading
Renaissance and the first stirrings of the modern world. Like the great
minds of the Renaissance, he sought what we now call a holistic view
of things. Like the first proponents of the Scientific Revolution, many
of whom were among his friends, he drew information first and fore-
most from the world around him, breaking free of the obsession with
written texts that had shackled the Middle Ages. The book he valued
most, to use a revealing metaphor of the time, was the Book of
Nature.
Like many of his contemporaries, Aubrey stood between a fading
age and a dawning one in another way. He rode into Avebury less than
a year after the end of the Thirty Years War, a nightmare struggle
between Catholics and Protestants that left most of Central Europe in
smoking ruins. A few weeks after his visit, England’s King Charles I
was beheaded in a savage finale to the English Civil War, a political and
religious struggle that ripped apart the core of English society. These
explosions capped a century of ferocious conflict over religion that left
the moral claims of organized Christianity in tatters.
Many people of good will, horrified by the carnage, turned to the
scientific materialism offered by philosophers such as René Descartes.
Yet the “mechanical philosophy,” as it was called, had problems of its


own. Founded on a materialism that was just as dogmatic and rigid as
the religions it opposed, the new vision of a clockwork universe set in
motion by an absentee god threatened to empty the world of meaning
and make humanity lose touch with its own spiritual possibilities.
Reduce the cosmos to lifeless atoms colliding in a void, insightful peo-
ple had already realized, and every human and spiritual value gives
way to a universe ruled by blind necessity and brute force.
The forced choice between murderously dogmatic religion and
spiritually barren materialism drove many people to look for a third
option. Whispers of other possibilities were in the air, for those with
ears to hear. Ancient manuscripts rediscovered by Renaissance schol-
ars offered glimpses of long-forgotten spiritual paths. Travelers from
distant countries brought back tales of what we now call shamanic tra-
ditions in North America, Lapland, and the eastern reaches of the
expanding Russian Empire.
Another potent factor lay closer to home. Monuments such as
Avebury and Stonehenge posed a silent challenge to the British culture
of Aubrey’s time. As Aubrey and other students of British antiquities
discovered the sweep and magnitude of their country’s megalithic
ruins, their attention turned to what little was known of ancient
Britain. What they found, all but forgotten in a handful of Greek and
Roman writings, were fragmentary references to a mysterious group
of people called Druids.

#### Diviners, Poets, and Teachers.

Who were the Druids? The honest answer is that we really don’t know.
Most of what was written about them in ancient times vanished forev-
er when the Roman Empire collapsed in the fifth century of the

Common Era. All the surviving texts written about the Druids
when they still existed add up to a total of ten pages or so in English
translation.
This meager harvest offers little solid knowledge. Druids lived
among Celtic tribes in Gaul (modern France), Britain, Ireland, and
apparently nowhere else. Their name may have meant “wise ones of
the oak,” although scholars have suggested many other interpretations.
They taught a secret wisdom that probably had something to do with
trees, and their sacred places were groves in the forest. Some classical
writers call Druids philosophers; others call them wizards. Not once
do the sources call them priests, although this is how most archeolo-
gists interpret them today. Several sources divide them into the three
categories of Bards, Ovates, and Druids, the Bards being poets, the
Ovates diviners, and the Druids teachers.
Custom forbade writing down Druid teachings, and Druids-in-
training had to memorize prodigious amounts of lore in verse form.
Some students took twenty years to complete the course of study,
which included theology, astronomy, and divination. After finishing
their studies, Druids formed a privileged class, exempt from taxes and
military service. They settled disputes and could part warring armies
on the brink of battle.
Crucial questions about ancient Druids remain unanswered. Their
origins? Julius Caesar, whose book on the Roman conquest of Gaul is
the most detailed source we have, noted that Druid teachings were
thought to come from Britain originally, while a Greek scholar
claimed that the Druids got their lore from the Greek philosopher
Pythagoras; no other writer refers to the subject. Their ceremonies?
The unreliable Roman author Pliny describes Druids gathering mistle-
toe from an oak with a sickle of gold. Several others refer offhand to
Druids playing some role when animals or humans were sacrificed to
the gods. Most authors say nothing.Their organization? Caesar claimed


that an Archdruid of Gaul was elected by other Druids,but no one else
refers to anything of the kind.Their daily life? No ancient writer men-
tions it at all.
After the Roman conquest of Gaul and Britain, Druids fade from
the classical sources. A few references from the third and fourth cen-
turies suggest that they could still be found, but had come down in the
world; one third-century Gaulish Druidess worked as an innkeeper. A
few Latin texts from the early Middle Ages, mostly biographies of
saints from the age of Christian conversions, refer to them but provide
nothing new.
These scraps were all the scholars of Aubrey’s time had on which to
base their studies. Old Irish literature had more to say, but two cen-
turies passed before anyone outside of Ireland realized that. Until
then, ten pages of Greek and Roman references comprised nearly
everything known about Druids. Folklore, tradition, and the mute evi-
dence offered by the old stones and earthworks of a forgotten age pro-
vided other sources of uncertain value.
Yet it was enough. People all over Britain started studying Druids,
writing about Druids, trying to tease out Druid secrets from any
available source. A surprising number of them went on to become
Druids, to embrace Druidry as a spiritual path in their own lives.The
idea of a green way of wisdom, a spirituality rooted in nature and the
living Earth, had a potent attraction for people who couldn’t stom-
ach either the rigid dogmatism of organized Christianity or the equal-
ly rigid nihilism of emerging modern science. Thus research into a
long-forgotten tradition gave birth to a serious attempt to revive it.

#### The Rebirth of Druidry.

According to traditions current in English Druid orders, a crucial step
in this process took place on 28 November 1717, when a meeting of
Druid enthusiasts at the Apple Tree Tavern in Covent Garden, London,
founded the Ancient Druid Order, the first Druid organization of
modern times. Some overly enthusiastic modern Druids portray this
meeting as a grand event drawing white-robed Druids from far and
wide. The reality must have been more prosaic: a dozen men in ordi-
nary dress in a private room of a middle-class pub, taking the first
uncertain steps toward a Druid revival between tankards of ale and
cider.
To date, nobody has found solid documentary evidence of the 1717
meeting, but the tradition is plausible enough. Eighteenth-century
England was bursting at the seams with societies, clubs, and secret or
semisecret orders, most of them poorly documented. Even such
famous organizations as the Freemasons, who founded their first
Grand Lodge earlier that same year, preserved few records from this
time. A Druid society could well have flourished in London at that
time and left only equivocal traces of its existence. Still, whether or
not the 1717 meeting happened, it’s clear that, in these same years,
the broader Druid Revival was under way.
The earliest modern Druids came to the Revival with diverse agen-
das. Some sought to rework Christianity into a greener form, while
others rejected Christianity altogether and sought an alternative faith.
Movements in this latter direction faced serious legal problems, since
believing in more than one god and questioning the Christian doctrine
of the Trinity were crimes under British law until the early nineteenth
century. Druids with alternative views had to step warily.
Nonetheless, some amazingly innovative religious thinking occurred.
The central theme of this new spirituality was pantheism—a belief


that the universe itself is a living, divine being.The word _pantheism_ was
coined by the Irish writer John Toland (1670–1722), whose many
interests included Druid lore. Toland is among those said to have
attended the 1717 London meeting, and certainly his views on reli-
gion had a major impact on the Druid Revival. To pantheist Druids,
nature was literally divine, the material body of God, and nothing nat-
ural was to be despised or rejected. In the society of the time, with its
rigid formalities and moral codes, this was explosive stuff.
Yet the first century and a half of the Druid Revival also saw impor-
tant links between Druidry and the Latitudinarian movement in the
Church of England. Latitudinarians hoped to move the Church away
from doctrinal squabbles, urged tolerance for dissent, and proposed a
personal spirituality based on meditation and individual study.
Latitudinarian Druids such as William Stukeley (1687–1765), whose
Druid path led him to the Anglican ministry, held that Druid nature
mysticism was entirely compatible with such a personal, non-dogmatic
Christianity. Meanwhile, Druids of all kinds borrowed freely from the
extensive Anglican literature on meditation and spiritual exercises.
These two currents—pantheism and Latitudinarian Christianity—
pulled the early Druid Revival in different directions, but never quite
pulled it apart. The two wings of the Revival sniped at each other, to
be sure;Toland wrote a _History of the Druids_ that was an extended satire
on the Anglican Church, while Stukeley promoted Druid teachings
among his fellow Anglicans as a way to counter Toland’s pantheism.
Both currents spoke to the needs of their time, however, and helped
people see Druidry as a path for the present, not simply a curiosity
from the past.

THE REVIVAL

TRADITIONS



# THE SHEER LIMITATIONS OF

the sources at hand forced Druidry to borrow and inno-

vate from the very beginning. With so little to go on, the

Revival squeezed the available evidence for whatever it

would yield. Anything even slightly connected to the

ancient Druids was fair game. An offhand comment by

Caesar that Druids taught lore about the planets sent half

a dozen Druid writers roaming Salisbury Plain, hoping to

tease out secrets of Druid astronomy and cosmology from

the megalithic sites there. Two ancient Greek authors

compared Druids to Pythagoreans, a Greek sect devoted

to sacred geometry and number mysticism; that was

enough to put eager Druids in hot pursuit of Pythagorean

lore, much of which ended up incorporated in Druid

Revival teachings.

THEDRUIDRYHANDBOOK

Even more important was the simple fact that the ancient Druids wor-
shipped in groves and forest glades. This glimpse of woodland spiritu-
ality evolved into a potent theme of the Revival. Druids and forests
fused so totally in the British imagination that a 1743 book on growing
oak trees, among the earliest books of silviculture in English, was titled
_The Modern Druid_.
All these patterns, the borrowing and innovation as well as the
Arcadian vision, need to be understood in the context of the age. By
the middle of the eighteenth century, the Industrial Revolution was
under way, and its human and ecological costs were soaring out of
sight. Mines, factories, and vast fetid slums sprawled across England.
The urban poor, most of them country folk driven off land their ances-
tors had farmed for generations, faced a world in which children as
young as eight had to work sixteen-hour days to keep their families
from starving. In urban slums and factory districts, a new industrial
landscape took shape, defined by red brick, black iron, and choking
clouds of coal smoke.
This desecrated landscape gave new meaning to Druidry. In an age
drunk with the power of an Earth-damaging technology, the vision of
an older wisdom learned among trees forcefully challenged the legit-
imacy of the new industrial order. The second half of the eighteenth
century, the first great flowering of Revival Druidry, was also the
seedtime of modern ecological thought, the years in which British nat-
uralist Rev. Gilbert White (1720–1793) wrote his pioneering _Natural
History of Selbourne_ and German polymath Johann Wolfgang Goethe
(1749–1832) laid the foundations of a holistic science of nature.
Insights such as these, and the broader movement of principled oppo-
sition to industrialism, played a crucial role in the growth of Druidry
and helped shape its vision of a spirituality of green nature.
Historical scholarship also fed into the developing Druid tradition.
Revival Druids made an eager audience for books about the Pagan


past, comparative religion, myth, and folklore. From the beginning of
the Revival, such works served as raw material for reconstructions of
ancient Druid teachings. Most were far off the mark by today’s stan-
dards, but were on the intellectual cutting edge of their own time.
They also gave Druids tools that could be used to challenge the reli-
gious and social orthodoxies of the day.
Thus early nineteenth-century theories traced Paganism back to
Noah via a hypothetical Helio-Arkite cult worshipping the Sun and
Noah’s ark. Druids borrowed these ideas, linked them to Welsh myth,
wove them into their rituals and teachings, and proceeded to claim
that, as good Helio-Arkites, their religion was older and purer than
the Church of England’s. By the last decades of the same century,
scholars were arguing that all Pagan religions evolved from the wor-
ship of penis and vagina as symbols of life and fertility. Druids bor-
rowed these theories and applied them to Christianity, proposing
calmly that Jesus was a phallic symbol and churches were immense
stone vaginas—all this in the middle of the Victorian era!
The deadpan humor of both of these examples was another trait
that showed up early and often in the Revival. Thus William Stukeley
poked fun at the wild theories circulating around Stonehenge in the
early eighteenth century by proposing, with a straight face, that a tribe
of intelligent elephants from Africa could have built the great stone
circle. A century and a half later, Owen Morgan, Archdruid of the
Druids of Pontypridd in Wales and a supporter of the sexual theory of
religion, prefaced a book full of vivid erotic symbolism and blatantly
sexual interpretations of Christian myth with a prim little note sug-
gesting that only those with depraved imaginations would find any-
thing offensive in its pages. Puckish comments of this sort kept
Druidry’s critics off balance, and kept Druidry itself from becoming
too pompous.

THEDRUIDRYHANDBOOK

#### Druids and Masons.

Another current that flowed into the Revival came from Freemasonry.
The Order of Free and Accepted Masons started out as a medieval
guild of stonemasons in England and Scotland. In the seventeenth cen-
tury, Masons’ lodges began admitting “accepted Masons”—members
from outside the building trades who were attracted by Masonic ritu-
als and symbolism as well as the social side of membership. By the first
years of the eighteenth century, accepted Masons formed a majority in
most lodges, and Freemasonry transformed itself into a men’s social
club dedicated to self-improvement and charitable assistance, as it
remains today.
Freemasons evolved an effective system of organization centered
on local lodges and powerful ritual and symbolic tools for initiation
ceremonies. During the eighteenth century, as Freemasonry became
fashionable throughout Europe and the American colonies, their
methods were borrowed by many other groups: the Odd Fellows, the
Bucks, the Gormogons, the Mopses—and the Druids. It’s probably
not an accident that the traditional date of the Ancient Druid Order’s
origin in 1717 was a few months after the founding of the first
Masonic Grand Lodge of England. Links between Druidry and
Freemasonry branched out in many directions, and at least one signif-
icant Druid order, the Ancient and Archaeological Order of Druids
(AAOD), founded in 1874 by the Mason and Rosicrucian Robert
Wentworth Little, had close connections to esoteric circles within
British Masonry.
Another aspect of Freemasonry helped drive these links with the
Druid tradition. In the intensely class-conscious society of eighteenth-
century Europe, some gentlemen Freemasons fretted about the awk-
ward fact that their beloved order had started out as a working class
trade union. Some Masons of the time chose to manufacture more


romantic origins for their order. Connections between the
Freemasons and crusading orders of knighthood such as the Knights
Templar were widely alleged, despite a distinct lack of evidence, and
of course the same allegations are repeated today.
Another attempt to find a pedigree for Freemasonry, however,
traced it back to the ancient Druids. As with the Templar connection,
lack of evidence was no barrier to eager Masonic imaginations. During
the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, many male Druids were also
Freemasons. The two groups shared an interest in ancient mysteries
and a dislike for dogmatic religion, and Druid orders with Masonic
links, such as the AAOD, made contact easy. Thus Masonic traditions
were caught up in the quest for surviving fragments of Druid lore.
However inaccurate the results may have been historically, some
Masonic material meshed well with Druid Revival teachings and
gained a lasting place in the tradition.
Celtic sources, finally, played an important but complex role in the
Revival.The ancient Druids survived in Ireland and Scotland long after
they vanished elsewhere, and scraps of Druid lore can be traced to
Irish and Scots bardic schools that still existed early in the Revival.
Politics, however, made these sources too hot to handle for many
years. The heirs of the exiled House of Stuart, driven from the British
throne and widely hated in England for their attempts to abolish civil
and religious liberties, drew on support from Ireland and the
Highlands through most of the eighteenth century.This poisoned rela-
tions between English and Gaelic communities and made it impossible
for English Druids to make use of Irish or Scots material until the
threat of a Stuart reconquest was long past.

#### Welsh Druidry.

Wales was another matter, however. While Wales became Christian as
early as any country in Western Europe, remarkable survivals existed.
Oxen were being sacrificed in half-Pagan rites at Clynnog Fawr as late
as 1589. A few centuries earlier, in the last years of the Welsh struggle
for independence, something very like a deliberate revival of Celtic
Paganism seems to have taken place, setting mythic figures out of
Welsh legend—Hu Gadarn, Ceridwen, Gwyn ap Nudd, and others—
in place of the Trinity and saints of conventional Christian devotion.
Thus the fifteenth-century bard Rhys Brydydd wrote:

```
The smallest, if compared with small,
Is the Mighty Hu, in the world’s judgment,
And he is the greatest, and Lord over us,
And our God of mystery.
```
Such statements raised the hackles of the more orthodox clergyman-
poet Sion Kent (d. 1420), who wrote:

```
Two kinds of inspiration in good truth
Exist and manifest their course on earth:
Inspiration from sweet-spoken Christ,
Orthodox and gladdening the soul,
And that most unwise other inspiration,
Concerned with false and filthy prophecy
Received by the devotees of Hu,
The unjustly usurping bards of Wales.
```
From this historical distance, it’s hard to be sure just what was
going on here. Some historians have suggested it may have been pure
literary affectation. Still, the spluttering wrath of Sion Kent’s poem
suggests that something more serious was afoot. Kent’s stark opposi-
tion between Christ and Hu, Rhys Brydydd’s “god of mystery,” is hard
to explain in anything but a theological sense.


This shadowy medieval revival set the stage for the rise of Welsh
Druidry in the nineteenth century.The Welsh poet and scholar Edward
Williams (1747–1826), usually known by his bardic name Iolo
Morganwg (Iolo of Glamorgan), launched this branch of the Revival
with writings and public rituals based on lore allegedly passed down
through Welsh bardic circles. The trickster of the Druid Revival, Iolo
was not above giving out his own exquisite poetry as the work of
medieval Welsh bards or slipping his own work into otherwise authen-
tic texts. His writings are a mix of traditional Welsh lore, ideas bor-
rowed from earlier Druid Revival authors, and his own brilliant
inventions. For good or ill, no other individual had as great an impact
on the nineteenth-century Revival.
Welsh _eisteddfodau_ (bardic assemblies) adopted Iolo’s rituals and
symbolism in the early nineteenth century and launched an utterly
respectable Christian branch of Druidry that remains active to this
day.Yet Iolo’s legacy also led in wilder directions. Following his lead,
Myfyr Morganwg (Edward Davies) and his successor Morien (Owen
Morgan) headed a Druid order at Pontypridd in Wales all through the
late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.The astonishing Dr.
William Price—Druid, labor organizer, socialist, naturopathic
physician, nudist, and proponent of cremation, among much else—
had connections to Pontypridd’s Druids as well. Price, the most
colorful of the Welsh Druids of his day, used to chant “a song of the
primitive bard to the Moon” at the rocking stone at Pontypridd, clad
in a white tunic, green trousers, and red waistcoat, with the skin of a
fox over his head and shoulders.
The nineteenth century was a difficult time, however, for connec-
tions between Druid Revival groups in England and France and their
opposite numbers in Wales, Brittany, and other Celtic countries. The
English government’s oppressive policies in Ireland sparked a Celtic
nationalist movement with little tolerance for people outside surviv-
ing Celtic cultures. Many Celtic nationalists turned to conservative

Christianity to counter an increasingly secular English culture, and
even those who stayed interested in Druid lore rejected Druid groups
outside the Celtic nations with considerable heat. Druid groups in
England and elsewhere responded in various ways. Many continued to
support causes such as Irish home rule, but others withdrew from the
political sphere. The divisions in the Druid movement opened by the
bitter politics of the nineteenth century remained unhealed through-
out the century that followed, and are only just beginning to be
resolved today.

#### The Druidry of the Revival.

By the late nineteenth century, despite these troubles, Druidry
evolved into a distinctive spiritual and cultural tradition, and became
something of an institution in the British culture of the time. Druid
groves (local groups), for the most part small and fiercely independ-
ent, pursued many variations on a common theme. Druid teachings
varied from order to order and from Druid to Druid, but shared basic
principles and traditions. Books, rituals, and symbols provided a lan-
guage of ideas common to most Druids, but nothing like a Druid
orthodoxy ever took shape—and few Druids would have tolerated
one if it had.
Three main themes formed a broad consensus within which most
Druids worked out their personal paths. First was a deep sense of rev-
erence for the land. The image of the Druid sitting beneath a tree or a
standing stone contemplating hidden mysteries, a commonplace of
poets throughout the eighteenth century, became common reality in the
nineteenth, although the white robes and pastoral staff of the poetic
image generally gave way to the wool jacket and walking stick of the


middle-class Victorian out for a day in the country. Druids were also
at the cutting edge of movements in natural medicine and a healthier
diet. A number of Druids from the late nineteenth century on were
nudists as well, taking closeness to nature to its logical conclusion.
A second shared theme was personal spiritual development. Druid
spirituality rejected orthodox notions of sin, judgment, and damna-
tion and embraced instead a vision of human souls working out their
personal salvation from life to life. Practices to foster inner develop-
ment found a natural place in this vision. Methods of meditation bor-
rowed mostly from Anglican sources formed the most widely used
approach to inner development, though Druids borrowed freely from
other traditions as well.
Public ritual formed a third theme that set Druidry apart from
most other alternative traditions in Britain. From 1792, when Iolo
Morganwg and a group of Druids including the poet William Blake
celebrated the autumn equinox on Primrose Hill before a crowd of
baffled and fascinated Londoners, Druid tradition affirmed that cer-
tain ceremonies were best done “in the face of the sun, the eye of
light.” Though it had its problems, public ritual had a spectacular
advantage: it made the Druids familiar. Few people harbored dark sus-
picions about Druids, since anyone curious about them could walk up
to the ritual circle, look at the billowing robes and ceremonial ban-
ners, watch the sword thrust into its sheath as peace was proclaimed
to the quarters, and hear the words of the ritual. This gave Druids a
respectability that helped keep them out of the scrapes suffered by
more secretive traditions.
It’s interesting, moreover, to compare these central themes with
the core elements of other spiritual traditions then and now. Notably
absent was any sense that Druids ought to hold any particular set of
beliefs or restrict themselves to any particular set of practices. This
freedom of thought and action ran straight through barriers few other

THEDRUIDRYHANDBOOK

people in the Western world could think of breaching. To most
Victorians, for example, differences in religious beliefs opened up into
vast social and cultural chasms. Yet as Druidry developed, it made
space for an extraordinary diversity of religious faith. The pantheist
and Latitudinarian views of the early Revival found common ground
with a revived Pagan polytheism inspired by early British Pagans such
as Thomas Taylor (1758–1835), and with Asian religions such as
Buddhism and Hinduism.
Thus no one in the Druid community turned a hair when the
Archdruid Myfyr Morganwg enlivened proceedings at an 1878 bardic
gathering by invoking the Hindu goddess Kali. Most Druids, by this
time, had come to believe that Druidry transcended limits of place,
culture, or ethnic background. To them, the path they followed was a
timeless spiritual possibility, open to all who shared its principles and
were willing to learn its ways. In a world where strife between follow-
ers of dogmatic religions was a daily event, many Druids placed high
hopes in a spiritual path that built bridges instead of raising walls.

overseas helped foster this sense of its wider potential.

Druid societies imported from Britain first appeared in

America in the closing years of the Revolution, and by the

First World War, most Druid orders had sizeable

American and Canadian branches and presences

Australia, New Zealand, and much of Europe.

French Druidry has a more complex history. Interest in

the ancient Druids went back even further in France than

in Britain, but the political power of the Catholic Church

made it difficult to follow a Druid path openly until well

into the nineteenth century. Once the barriers were down,

however, French Druidry made up for lost time, rapidly

creating an intensely creative Druid scene with its own dis-

tinct flavor and transmitting it to French-speaking

regions in Canada. Brittany, the once independent Celtic region of
France, contributed much to this development, although the pressures
of competing nationalisms meant that Breton and French Druids had
a complex and difficult relationship similar to that of Welsh and
English Druids.
All these patterns remained in place through the twentieth centu-
ry, although the Druid tradition continued to develop in new ways and
drew on an ever-wider range of influences: Edwardian magical orders
in the early years of the century, Asian spiritual traditions, the nature-
oriented Woodcraft movement, the cultural revolution of the Sixties,
and the Pagan renaissance in the century’s last decades. Yet powerful
factors forced a reassessment of 300 years of Druid tradition during
these same years.
The rise of scientific archeology was the most important of these.
As scholars made the past yield up its secrets, core assumptions of
many Druid orders were overturned. The traditional image of the
Druid, wise in the ways of green nature, gave way in scholarly litera-
ture to an “obscure barbarian priesthood”of no interest to anyone but
specialists.^2
This dismissal of Druidry, however, was neither as objective nor as
disinterested as its promoters claimed. Archeology in the early twen-
tieth century was a new science, eager to secure prestige and funding
by staking out a territory and defending it against all comers. The
Druid Revival, with its very different portrayal of the British past,
could not be tolerated. Thus the archeologist Glyn Daniels wrote let-
ters demanding that “those horrid bogus Druids” be barred from
Stonehenge, while his colleague Stuart Piggott condemned “self-styled
Druids which today represent the fag-end of the myth” as “pathetic.”^3
Despite mixed motives, however, archeologists and historians were
able to show that the Druidry of the Revival was a modern spiritual
movement, not an ancient one. Many Druids refused to accept this. By
the early twentieth century, some Druid orders claimed unbroken lin-


eages back to the ancient Druids. Such claims became hard to defend.
Once made, however, they were even harder to give up. Thus even
Druids as serious and intellectually capable as Ross Nichols
(1902–1975), founder of the Order of Bards Ovates and Druids
(OBOD) and a dominant figure in Druid circles in the decade or so
before his death, clung to historically unlikely claims of a continuous
tradition as if the spiritual validity of Druidry depended on them.
It took many years for Druids to realize that the historical roots of
a tradition don’t affect its spiritual validity—that Druidry’s relevance
depends on the gifts it has to offer here and now. As a living spiritual
tradition with three centuries of achievements to its credit, Druidry
can stand on its own and has no need of ancient lore to prop it up. By
the dawn of the twenty-first century, the most influential Druid
Revival orders had come to terms with their own history and aban-
doned inaccurate claims about the past.

#### Druidry Today.

But what of the name “Druid”and the imagery that surrounds it? A case
can probably be made for finding some other label for the tradition,
but there are solid reasons against this. First is the sheer historical fact
that the Druids of the Revival took that name, and not another; they
were inspired by the ancient Druids and not some other ancient
priesthood; and they have been known by that name ever since. For
three centuries, the word “Druid” has meant, among other things, a
participant in the Revival. Relabeling that movement “British
Universalist Post-Anglican Latitudinarian Pantheist Neo-Pythagorean
Nature Spirituality”or some other long-winded term is hardly an
improvement.

```
DRUIDRY IN THEWIDERWORLD
```

THEDRUIDRYHANDBOOK

Yet the Revival has another claim to the name Druid. Near the
beginning of his book on Druids, Stuart Piggott asked:

```
[W]hy has a priesthood within the barbarian pre-Roman Celtic
religion, attested by a handful of some thirty scrappy references
in Greek and Roman authors, many little-known and some
downright obscure, come even to be remembered at all except
by scholars nearly two thousand years after its official suppres-
sion by Roman authority?^4
```
It’s a fair question, and the answer is the Druid Revival. Ancient Druids
are more than a footnote in history books today because a few vision-
aries in the early eighteenth century discovered them, were inspired by
what they found, and set out on a quest to reconstruct a Druid spiritu-
ality in their own time.The innovative path they created put down deep
roots in the Western world’s imagination, and effectively defined the
meaning of the word “Druid” for the modern world. Even those who
most roundly reject the Druid Revival and all its works still common-
ly think of Druids in the terms the Revival created.
Thus when undergraduates at Carleton College, an Episcopalian
college in Minnesota, decided in 1963 to protest a college requirement
for Sunday chapel attendance, the “Druid church” they concocted had
an astonishing resemblance to Druid Revival traditions, even though
none of the culprits had any direct contact with traditional Druid
organizations. The Reformed Druids of North America (RDNA), as
they named their prank, had a thoroughly Druid sense of humor and a
pantheist theology that John Toland would have heartily approved.The
RDNA’s statement of belief, in the mock-formal language favored by
its founders, ran as follows:

```
1. The object of the search for religious truth, which is a universal
and never-ending search, may be found through the Earth-
Mother; which is Nature; but this is one way among many.
```

```
2. And great is the importance, which is a spiritual importance, of
Nature, which is the Earth-Mother; for it is one of the objects of
Creation, and with it do people live, yea, even as they do strug-
gle through life are they come face to face with it.
```
For working purposes, these two tenets took on a simpler form:

```
1. Nature is good!
2. Likewise, Nature is good!
```
It would be hard to sum up the central theme of the Druid Revival
more succinctly. Like the Revival itself, the RDNA went in unexpect-
ed directions. Although Carleton College’s chapel attendance require-
ment was abolished in 1964, many RDNA members found that the
liturgy and teachings invented for the “Druid church” was a meaningful
spiritual path. The RDNA remains active to this day, and easily half the
Druid organizations in North America today trace their origins to it.

#### Druidry and Modern Paganism.

The extraordinary revival of Paganism throughout the Western world
in the last decades of the twentieth century brought Druidry publicity
and new members, but it also embroiled traditional Druid orders in
occasional quarrels. Some newly minted Pagan groups tried to lay
exclusive claim to Celtic tradition; others denounced the Druid
Revival for its tolerance of monotheism, its willingness to borrow use-
ful material from sources rejected by mainstream scholarship, and the
inability of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Druids to respond to
late twentieth-century political causes in advance. Meanwhile, other
Pagans borrowed freely from Druid Revival sources, and a number of
traditional Druid orders returned the favor by borrowing from the new
Paganism.

DRUIDRY IN THEWIDERWORLD

THEDRUIDRYHANDBOOK

The unfolding ecological crisis of the late twentieth century
brought even more attention to Druidry, and continues to do so today.
After 300 years, the Industrial Revolution launched in seventeenth-
century Britain now dominates the globe, with consequences that
become more problematic with each passing year. Druidry, although
born alongside the Industrial Revolution, traced out a radically differ-
ent way of relating to the Earth. Its principled refusal to join industri-
al society’s war against nature gave it a strong appeal to people seeking
a saner way of life. In turn, many Druid organizations have taken up
environmental causes with gusto, with tree-planting programs a par-
ticular favorite.
The results have gone mostly unnoticed by the media and main-
stream culture, but they mark a sea change in Western religious history.
Michel Raoult, one of the few scholars to study modern Druidry, esti-
mated, in his 1980 dissertation _Les Druides: Les Sociétés Initiatiques Celtiques
Contemporaines_ , that Druid organizations worldwide boast 1 to 2 million
members. That’s an impressive figure for an alternative spiritual move-
ment, and the community has added members steadily since then. If its
growth continues, the modern Druid movement may yet become a sig-
nificant factor in today’s religious and cultural scene.
What will happen then? It’s anyone’s guess, since Druidry is an
ongoing quest, shaped by the challenges and needs of each age. Still,
the ecological crises and inner discords that threaten an increasingly
fragile industrial society make Druidry at least as relevant today as it
was when John Aubrey rode into the village of Avebury and discovered
a riddle written in ancient stone.

viving Celtic cultures, borrowings from other spiritual

traditions, insights from the world of living nature, and

the mute testimony of green earth and standing stone

shaped a foundation on which three centuries of Druids

have built in many different ways.To present the results in

any detail would fill volumes, and provide little help and

much confusion to the novice Druid. For this reason I’ve

focused the discussion of Druid teaching here on nine

core concepts, suggesting some of their meanings and a

few of their complexities.

Others could have been chosen, but these nine touch

on most of the central themes of Druidry—sometimes in

THEDRUIDRYHANDBOOK

unepected ways. The following pages say more than a casual glance
may notice. As William Blake said, “The wisest of the ancients consid-
ered what is not too explicit as the fittest for instruction.”
These nine concepts are divided up, in keeping with Druid tradi-
tion, into three triads. The first triad of Druid teachings covered here
focuses on three fundamental images, each of which is itself a triad:
the Three Rays of Light, the Three Circles of Manifestation, and the
three elements of Druid natural philosophy.

#### Three Rays of Light.

Einigen the Giant, the first of all beings, beheld three rays of light
descending from the heavens.Those three rays were also a word of three
syllables, the true name of the god Celi, the hidden spirit of life that cre-
ates all things. In them was all the knowledge that ever was or is or will
be. Beholding the rays, Einigen took three staves of rowan and carved all
knowledge upon them, in letters of straight and slanted lines. But when
others saw the staves, they misunderstood and worshipped the staves as
gods, rather than learning the knowledge written upon them. So great
was Einigen’s grief and anger at this that he burst asunder and died.
When a year and a day had passed after Einigen’s death, Menw son
of Teirwaedd happened on the skull of Einigen, and saw that the three
rowan staves had taken root inside it and were growing out of its
mouth. Taking the staves, Menw learned to read the writing on them
and became famous for his wisdom. From him, the lore of the rowan
staves passed to the Gwyddoniaid—the ancient loremasters of the
Celts—and ultimately from them to the Druids. Thus the knowledge
that had once shone forth in three great rays of light, passed through
many minds and hands, now forms the wisdom of the Druid tradition.
The tale of Einigen the Giant and the three rays of light is the origin


myth of the Druid Revival. The rays themselves form the core symbol
of Druidry, and appear constantly wherever Druid Revival teachings
have left traces. They represent _Awen_ , the heart of the Druid path.
What is Awen? In its most basic sense, it means spirit, inspiration,
and illumination. Awen is the inner light that gives the mind the ability
to reach beyond itself. It’s Awen that turns writers of verse into poets
and shows glimpses of the future to prophets and diviners.
Druids of the Revival studied the lore of Awen and related it to
knowledge and experience from many sources. They knew that peo-
ple of all religions experienced moments of illumination in which the
world took on profound meaning. Some of these experiences, they
knew, happened when people turned their attention outward to
nature or the great spiritual powers of nature that human beings call
gods. They knew that other experiences of the same kind took place
when people turned their attention inward to the core of themselves.
These two modes of experience are symbolized by two ways of
drawing the three rays of light. The first, the invoking form \|/, rep-
resents the experience of Einigen—the descent of Awen from a divine
source outside the self. The second, more commonly used evoking
form /|\ represents the experience of Menw—the awakening of
Awen within the individual soul through study and contemplation (see
figure 1).The two forms together form an emblem called the _Tribann_.

THEDRUIDRYHANDBOOK

The tale of the three rays of light is myth, not history. Yet the word
“myth” needs to be understood with care. Too many people today use
it to mean a story that isn’t true. Real myths, however, aren’t mere
lies, even when they have nothing to do with historical fact. As the
Greek philosopher Sallust put it: “Myths are things that never hap-
pened, but always are.”^5
Thus it matters not at all whether a person named Menw ap
Teirwaedd existed, whether he came across the skull of a giant with
three rowan shoots growing out of it, or whether this happened exactly
366 days after the giant’s death.The daily-newspaper sense of literal fact
that fundamentalists bring to sacred texts has no place in the Druid
understanding of myth. The heart of any myth is not whether it hap-
pened—or, for that matter, who wrote it—but what it means and what
it has to teach.
This insight itself is, in fact, among the things the tale of Einigen
teaches. Einigen recognized the rays of light, and Menw recognized
the staves, as bearers of knowledge. The others who saw the staves
failed to grasp this, and worshipped the staves instead of learning from
them. There’s a potent lesson here on the difference between a reli-
gion of belief and a spirituality based on understanding.The stave wor-
shippers treated the staves as objects of faith, and missed every
teaching those objects were meant to convey. In the same way, some-
one can believe in the story of Einigen and Menw, and never grasp that
their tale has something to teach.
This isn’t the only lesson of the myth, however.The three rays are also
three shouts and the three parts of the true name of the god Celi, the
hidden source of all things. That name is the word Awen itself, divided
into three syllables: Ah-Oh-En.Take a moment to think about what this
means. Awen, the inner illumination that gives gifts of poetry and
prophecy, is the true name of the source of all things. To touch Awen
is to touch the divine energy that creates the universe.To write a poem
that captures a flash of inspiration is to enact the deed of Einigen,


whose rowan staves caught the wisdom shown forth in the three rays
of Awen. To read a poem and catch a glimpse of the original inspira-
tion is to enact the deed of Menw. Thus the tale of the three rays of
light is told again in every work of creativity.
In Druid lore, the three rays are also the first rays of the rising Sun
at the summer solstice, the winter solstice, and the equinoxes, shining
on a standing stone and casting its shadow across the ground.The Sun’s
rays trace the invoking form, while the shadows trace the evoking
form, as shown in figure 2.

```
FIGURE 2. THE THREE RAYS, THE SOLSTICES,
AND THE EQUINOXES.
```
An ancient myth found in many lands describes the creation of the
cosmos from the body of a primal giant. In these legends, the skull of
the giant becomes the dome of the sky. The Welsh myth of Einigen,
echoing these ancient tales, has rowan staves rising from the dead
giant’s skull in place of the dawns that define the year. Thus another
meaning of the myth is enacted each year when the Sun rises at its
three primary positions on the eastern horizon: southeast at midwin-
ter, northeast at midsummer, due east at spring and fall.

```
THEFIRSTTRIAD
```

THEDRUIDRYHANDBOOK

Each ray has its own symbolism and meaning. The first, or midwin-
ter, ray extends from the southeast \ | /or toward the northwest / | **\** .It
is named Gwron (“goo-RON”) and represents the Sun at its lowest
point at the winter solstice, amid the darkness and cold of winter.
Gwron is the knowledge of Awen.
The second, or midsummer, ray extends from the northeast \| /or
toward the southwest / | \. It is called Plennydd (“PLEN-nith”) and rep-
resents the Sun at the midsummer height of its power. Plennydd is the
power of Awen.
The third, or equinoctial, ray extends from the east \ |/or toward
the west / |\. It is called Alawn (“AH-lon”) and represents the Sun at
the point of balance, midway along its rising and falling course through
the cycles of the year. Alawn is the peace of Awen.
Gwron, Plennydd, and Alawn are also the names of three mysteri-
ous figures of legend, the three first bards of the island of Britain. An
account from _Barddas_ claims that they first set out the ranks of Ovate,
Bard, and Druid among the Gwyddoniaid, the loremasters of the
Celts, in the days before their wanderings brought them to Britain.
Thus the three classes of Druids also correspond to the three rays.
Bards, who preserve knowledge of the past, correspond to the mid-
winter ray. Ovates, who encounter the living power of the spiritual
realms, correspond to the midsummer ray. Druids, who unite knowl-
edge and power, and traditionally separated armies on the edge of bat-
tle to bring peace, correspond to the central ray of the equinoxes.

#### Three Circles of Manifestation.

Not all Druid teachings take the form of mythic tales. Philosophy and
formal instruction also have their place, as in another core element of
Druid tradition—the three circles of manifestation.These three circles


—called Abred, Gwynfydd, and Ceugant—map out the Druid vision
of the origin and destiny of the human soul (see figure 3).

```
FIGURE 3. THE THREE CIRCLES OF MANIFESTATION.
```
_Abred_ (pronounced “AH-bred”), the lowest circle, is the beginning of
the soul’s pilgrimage, the realm of plant and animal life in the world
of nature. Each soul comes from the Cauldron of Annwn (pronounced
“ah-NOON”), the mineral realm, which is also the reservoir of
unformed soul-stuff. Newly formed souls incarnate in the simplest
single-celled forms of life. As they master the lessons these have to
teach, they rise to more complex states. Life after life, form after
form, each soul gathers knowledge through countless reincarnations.
Druid teachings do not romanticize Abred. As Druids know, most
plants and animals lead short and difficult lives that end in painful
deaths. Plants struggle with one another for light and soil, and every
animal survives by killing other living things. None of this is acciden-
tal or unnecessary. A bardic triad teaches that each soul must see all
things, know all things, and suffer all things before passing beyond the
circle of Abred.
Human life marks the upper limit of Abred. Here, a new factor—
freedom—enters the picture. Animals and plants are living, conscious

```
THEFIRSTTRIAD
```

THEDRUIDRYHANDBOOK

beings, but instinct and biological drives bind them to the hard paths
of Abred. Soul, at the human level, grows past these limits and can
shape destiny for good or ill. Souls can pass beyond Abred to the cir-
cle of Gwynfydd, remain human, or fall back down the winding paths
of Abred—possibly all the way to Annwn.
Tradition has it that each human failing copies the natural behavior
of some animal or plant, and a human who can’t outgrow a behavior
is reincarnated as that animal or plant—not as a punishment, but sim-
ply as a means of finishing the learning process. Someone who displays
the vanity of a cat or the empty-headedness of a sheep clearly didn’t
learn the lessons those forms teach, and must go back to relearn them,
in the same way that someone who fails a math test may be assigned a
remedial class.The creature that echoes your personal failings is called
your _cydfil_ (pronounced “KUD-vill”), and a skilled seer can glimpse a
person’s cydfil near them, as the shadow of a future incarnation. Each
animal life is followed by a new ascent toward the human level, for
Druid teachings insist that all beings will reach the second circle of
Gwynfydd eventually.
_Gwynfydd_ (pronounced “GWIN-vuth”) is the fulfillment of the
soul’s pilgrimage. Gifts of knowledge, power, and peace won during
the long journey through Abred unfold step by step in Gwynfydd as
souls remember their journey up from Annwn and draw upon lessons
learned along the way. Each soul learns to express its unique Awen,
memories, and perception of the universe—the three things that set
it apart from all other beings. In the process, each soul begins its jour-
ney through the circling paths of Gwynfydd.
This last concept sets Gwynfydd apart from more conventional
ideas of the afterlife, for Gwynfydd is not a resting place, but the start
of a new journey. A soul just arrived in Gwynfydd from the human
level compares to the mighty ones of Gwynfydd as a single-celled
organism at the lowest circle of Abred compares to a human being.
Just as the soul of the single-celled organism will reach human form


sooner or later, the soul new to Gwynfydd can expect to stand among
the mighty someday.Yet Gwynfydd itself is not the highest circle.
_Ceugant_ (pronounced “KYE-gant”) is the third and final circle of
manifestation, extending forever above Gwynfydd. You can think of
Ceugant as infinity itself. Just as a traveler on an open plain can chase
the horizon and never run the least risk of catching up to it, souls in
Gwynfydd rise forever in knowledge, power, and peace and always
find Ceugant beyond them. Ceugant represents the limitless potential
that souls rising from Annwn have not yet realized. According to tra-
ditional Druid lore, the divine powers of the cosmos dwell in its eter-
nal silences.
Like the three rays of light, the three circles of manifestation entered
the mainstream of the Druid tradition by way of Iolo Morganwg’s
_Barddas_ , although they weren’t his inventions.They first appeared in the
writings of Scots poet and Druid James Thomson (1700–1748) before
Iolo was born. Did Iolo borrow the circles from Thomson, or did both
take them from some other source? No one knows.
The three circles of manifestation can be taken quite literally, of
course. Many Druids, in fact, do take them this way, as a useful way to
understand the origins and destiny of the human soul. Seen in these
terms, the concept has much to offer. The hope of life after death can
call on plenty of evidence—near-death experiences, encounters with
spirits, and children who remember details of previous lives—to back
up the idea that human souls survive physical death and are reborn
after an interval into new bodies. Mystics and philosophers have sug-
gested for centuries that human beings have potentials that go far
beyond anything we can imagine, and there’s no good reason to think
that humanity in its present form is as far as the process of evolution
can go.The concept of the three circles makes sense of all these points
in a straightforward and elegant way.
Yet the three circles also apply within the limits of a single life, or,
for that matter, a single moment. We constantly face the choice

```
THEFIRSTTRIAD
```

THEDRUIDRYHANDBOOK

between Abred and Gwynfydd, between the habits of the past and the
potential for free choice that shapes the future. Whether or not our
future lives depend on the thoughtful use of freedom, our present lives
from day to day certainly do.
In fact, the three circles appear at every moment. Abred is the past,
fixed in time and impossible to change. Gwynfydd is the present,
opening onto freedom and infinite possibility. Ceugant is the future,
the horizon that recedes before us as we advance. One lesson here is
that it’s unwise to get stuck in the past, and unproductive to strain for-
ward to a future that’s always out of reach. The realm of human free-
dom and potential is always the present.
These points can be traced out in more detail. Choices made in the
past have power over the present, and this influence is traditionally
called fate. Fate presses toward the repetition of past patterns. When
you find yourself repeating the same experiences or can’t seem to get
past the consequences of some past event, fate is shaping your life.
From a wider perspective, fate is the power of Abred, the presence in
human life of the same rigid unthinking patterns that shape the lives of
animals and plants.
Fate doesn’t dominate all of life, however.The future also has power
in the present, for each soul has unique gifts that seek expression.Their
force is traditionally called destiny, the power that pulls the soul toward
situations in which its potential can be fulfilled.When you find yourself
thrust willy-nilly onto unfamiliar ground, faced with challenges you’ve
never met before, and forced back on resources you didn’t know you
had, destiny is shaping your life. From a wider perspective, destiny is
the power of Ceugant, the presence of the infinite and unknown.
Caught between fate and destiny, the human soul has a power of its
own—the ability to choose. This ability is will, and it holds the balance
between the pressure of the past and the pull of the future. When you
act in the world instead of simply reacting to it, guiding your life by your
own choices rather than being pushed and pulled by forces outside you,


will is shaping your life. From a wider perspective, will is the power of
Gwynfydd, the capacity for freedom and creativity in every moment.
Fate, will, and destiny weave the fabric of each person’s life. Any
two, however, can overpower the third.Thus, when will moves in har-
mony with destiny, the influence of the past has no power. When will
follows the bidding of fate, the deeper potentials of the self remain
asleep. When fate and destiny move together, will struggles against
them in vain. When all three pull in different directions, the soul
stumbles through life and achieves little. When all three work in the
same direction, Finally, nothing in the universe can stand against them
except the walls of Ceugant itself.
Families, cities, nations, and cultures have their own equivalents of
fate, will, and destiny, and so does humanity as a whole. To read history
is to watch these patterns unfolding on a grand scale, and the great crises
of the present time offer extraordinary opportunities to watch the three
factors at work.

#### Three Elements of Nature.

Most people today, when they hear the word “elements,” think of the
ninety-two chemical elements known to modern science. The same
textbooks that teach schoolchildren about these elements speak
scornfully of an older belief in only four elements: Fire,Water, Air, and
Earth.Yet that scorn is misplaced. Scientists in the eighteenth century
took over the word “element,” but changed its meaning. In fact, the
four elements of the old system weren’t elements in the same sense as
hydrogen, boron, or manganese. In the older sense, elements are basic
categories of human experience, not just material substances. Anger,
for example, is Fire in the world of the emotions, and summer is the

```
THEFIRSTTRIAD
```

THEDRUIDRYHANDBOOK

fiery season.To gauge the difference between ancient and modern ele-
ments, you might try finding an emotion or a season for helium!
One crucial difference hidden by this shift in meaning is that ele-
mental systems in the old sense need not be mutually exclusive.There’s
apparently only one valid way to sort out atoms by their atomic num-
bers, but elemental systems of the older kind can be shaped as needed
to respond to different situations. Thus many Western mystics and
magicians expanded the four elements by adding a fifth called Ether or
Spirit. Chinese philosophers used a different set of five elements:
Wood, Metal, Fire,Water, and Earth. Each system has its own strengths
and weaknesses, and many traditions use more than one.
Druid Revival lore contains an elemental system of its own: a set of
three elements that first appears in Iolo Morganwg’s early writings.
Whether it’s an invention of Iolo’s or a scrap of some older teaching is
anyone’s guess, but the three elements have been part of Druid Revival
lore ever since his time. These elements are _nwyfre_ , _gwyar_ , and _calas_.
_Nwyfre_ (pronounced “NOOiv-ruh”) is an old Welsh term meaning
“sky” or “heaven.” As an element, nwyfre is the source of life and con-
sciousness, and modern Druids often refer to it simply as the life
force. In some texts, _nef_ , the modern Welsh word for “heaven,” is used
for nwyfre. Its image in nature is blue sky.
_Gwyar_ (pronounced “GOO-yar”) literally means “blood” in old
Welsh, but its more general meaning is “flow” or “fluidity.” As an ele-
ment, gwyar is the source of change, motion, growth, and decay. In
some texts, the word _dwr_ , the modern Welsh word for “water,” is used
for gwyar. Its image in nature is running water.
_Calas_ (pronounced “CAH-lass”) comes from the same root as _caled_ ,
Welsh for “hard.” It means “solidity.” As an element, calas is the source
of form, differentiation, manifestation, and stability. In some texts, the
word _daiar_ , the modern Welsh word for “earth,” is used for calas. Its
image in nature is stone.
In one sense, these three elements are simply three parts of the


more common four-element system, with nwyfre equal to Air, gwyar
to Water, and calas to Earth. As a system in their own right, however,
they offer a complete vision of the universe and have important les-
sons to teach. According to Druid philosophy, everything in the uni-
verse is made up of these three elements in some combination, with
one being dominant. All are forms of a primal substance that Druids
call _manred_.
If you haven’t learned to think in elemental terms, it may take some
work to get your mind around the three Druid elements. Take a
moment to mull over some examples. The food on your dinner table
is a good example. The calas element of your dinner is the raw mate-
rial: meat, grains, vegetables, fruit. The gwyar element is the cooking
process that turns the raw material into the meal on your plate. The
nwyfre element is the mental dimension: the selection of ingredients,
the choice of recipes, and the skill and personality of the cook.
It’s not hard to find other examples, but you may wonder what
value such exercises have. The system of chemical elements has obvi-
ous powers. Scientists use it to shape matter in a galaxy of ways—
some helpful, others less so. Can anything as useful be done with the
elements of Iolo’s Druid philosophy, or with the four or five elements
of the broader tradition?
Nwyfre, gwyar, and calas have little relevance to physics or chem-
istry, to be sure. Their value lies elsewhere. Like other traditional ele-
mental systems, the three Druid elements make sense of patterns
throughout the universe of our experience. As tools for thinking, their
power lies in their ability to point the mind toward insights and side-
step common mistakes.
Take the common modern habit of thinking about the universe
purely in terms of physical matter and energy. This works well when
applied in certain ways, but it works very badly when applied to human
beings and other living things. Time and again, well-intentioned
experts using the best scientific tools have tried to tackle problems out-

side the laboratory and failed abjectly. Rational architecture and urban
planning, scientific agriculture and forestry, and logical schemes for
education and social reform often cause more problems than they
solve and fail to yield the results predicted by theory. Why? The theo-
reticians thought only of gwyar and calas, change and stability, energy
and matter. They left something out of the equation: nwyfre, the sub-
tle element of life, feeling, and awareness.They forgot that any change
they made would cause living things to respond creatively with
changes of their own.
All three elements must be considered in every situation. What is
the thing in question, what does it do, and what does it mean? What
will stay the same, what will change, and what will respond to the
change with changes of its own? This sort of thinking is one of the
secrets of the Druid elements. Table 1 gives some of the primary cor-
respondences.

The three elements make a particularly useful tool for thinking nowa-
days because of a habit of mind deeply entrenched in modern culture.
Many people today divide every situation into two, and only two, fac-
tors. This by itself isn’t necessarily a problem, but often the two fac-
tors are portrayed as absolute opposites with no common ground
uniting them, and this leads to trouble.Worse trouble occurs when the
opposites are assigned moral labels—one seen as completely good and
the other as absolutely evil. Think of political and religious squabbles
in recent decades and you’ll find more examples than you can count,
each one full of this sort of dualistic thinking: those who aren’t with
us are against us; you’re either part of the solution or part of the prob-
lem, and so on endlessly.
Back in the nineteenth century, schools of esoteric philosophy allied
to French Druidry worked out ways to overcome this habit of mental
dualism. In this teaching, any division into two is called a _binary_ , or more
fully, an unresolved binary. Binaries make useful tools for thinking when
you need to focus on differences, but they produce a distorted picture
unless they’re balanced by something else. The opposite distortion
comes from a _unary_ , a view that considers only one factor and focuses
attention exclusively on similarities.
The first number that guides thinking into balance is the number
three. Divisions into three are called _ternaries_. Every ternary, accord-
ing to this teaching, consists of two things opposed to each other, and
a third that connects them.Thinking in ternaries considers both differ-
ences and similarities. While it’s not foolproof, it thus sidesteps some
common obstacles to understanding.
Problems that can’t be solved in binary thinking often find ready
solutions once a third factor comes into play. Finding this third factor
was, therefore, a common training exercise in these traditions.
Students were presented with opposing views from philosophy, poli-
tics, and daily life, and told to find the third point of view that resolved
them into unity—or, in the language of the system, to neutralize the

binary. In this way, they also learned to see how the two sides of a
binary support, define, and require each other.
Ternary thinking has limitations of its own, however, that can be
avoided by using other numbers to think with. Every number between
one and thirteen, according to Druid teaching, has its own special
logic and usefulness.Yet the logic of the ternary has a special meaning
to Druids. It helps counter the pervasive binary thinking of modern
culture, and also resonates powerfully with the teachings of the Druid
Revival. There’s a deeper connection still, for ternaries appear again
and again in traditional Celtic myths, legends, and folklore. It’s not an
accident that Welsh and Irish bards assembled their lore in the form of
triads, or that love triangles, triple quests, and threefold deaths pro-
vide the framework for so many Celtic tales.
Ternary thinking solves problems created by too much reliance on
binaries. For this reason, cultures with threefold patterns offer
glimpses of a more balanced way of life to those caught in a harshly
dualistic society. This is one of the reasons why Celtic cultures have
such a strong appeal for many modern people.Yet this can also become
a trap if the relationship between binary and ternary is treated itself as
a binary. Drawing a binary distinction between binaries and ternaries
(or between modern society and another culture), picturing them as
irreconcilable opposites and labeling them in terms of right and
wrong, echoes the modern world’s habitual thinking while pretending
to escape from it. What third factor might neutralize this binary?
Thus, while ternary symbolism has a central role in many of today’s
Druid traditions, few rely on it exclusively. Instead, many different
numbers weave in and out of modern Druidry. Each has lessons to
teach, and different grades of initiation focus on numbers that express
their specific way of working with nature spirit. Similarly, the three
Druid elements are not the only elements Druids use. The four ele-
ments Earth, Water, Air, and Fire have an important part to play, and
the fivefold system, with Spirit at the center, also has a place.


These systems of three, four, and five elements have subtle and
important connections. The three Druid elements become four when
fire, or _ufel_ (pronounced “IV-el”) in old Welsh, is added. (The word
_tan_ , the modern word for “fire” in Welsh, is also used in some sources.)
The four elements correspond to the four directions, seasons, times of
day, and much more, and they play a primary role in many traditions
of Druid ritual (see Table 2). The four Alban Gates—the solstices and
equinoxes, the traditional Druid holy days through the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries—correspond to the four elements, as do the
symbols on the altar in a grove of the Ancient Order of Druids in
America, and the four levels of AODA initiation.

The four elements, in turn, become five when Air, or _awyr_ (pro-
nounced “OW-ir”) in Welsh, is added. (The words _wybr,_ “sky,” and _ffun_ ,
“breath,” are sometimes used for air in the old sources.) This may seem
like a paradox, since nwyfre is already air! Yet in most of the world’s

languages, words for “air” and “breath” and “spirit” have common
roots: the English word “spirit” itself comes from a Latin word for
“breath,” which also appears in words such as “respiration.” As with so
much in Druidry, a rigid approach has little value here, and it’s best
simply to recognize that Air and nwyfre fuse together when you’re
working with three or four elements, but draw apart when you work
with five.
The system of five elements is central to the modern Druid use of
Ogham, an ancient Irish alphabet (see chapter 5). The Ogham alpha-
bet consists of four groups, or _aicme_ , of five letters each, along with
five additional letters, or _forfedha_. Each of these sets of five corre-
sponds to the five elements, among other things. From this correspon-
dence, key elements of Druid practice unfold (see Table 3).

teachings explored here moves into the realm of spiritual

and magical symbolism. Here the triadic system spins

apart into a dance of other numbers. The solar and tel-

luric currents form a twofold pattern of primary ener-

gies; the eight stations of the Druid year provide a basic

cosmological pattern; the twenty-five letters of the

Ogham offer an alphabet of concepts and energies. From

their interplay unfolds the organic pattern of the Druid

cosmos.

```
THESECONDTRIAD
```

THEDRUIDRYHANDBOOK

#### Above and Below.

While the modern obsession with twofold patterns may be a source of
problems, twofold patterns themselves can be useful when approached
in a balanced way, and they have a valid place in Druid teachings. One
such pattern defines sources of nwyfre drawn on by Druids in ritual and
meditation: above, linked to Sun and sky, the symbols of nwyfre itself;
and below, linked to water and stone, the symbols of gwyar and calas.
To understand what this implies, you must know a little more about
nwyfre. If you’ve watched the Star WarsTMmovies, you know most of
what you need to know already; just think of nwyfre as the Force.
George Lucas, creator of the Star WarsTMsaga, borrowed the concept
from Japanese martial arts, in which nwyfre is called _ki_. He could have
found the same idea almost anywhere, for the concept is all but uni-
versal. The same force is called _prana_ in India, _qi_ in China, _n:um_ (the :
is a click) among the Kalahari bushmen, _ruach_ in Hebrew, and _pneuma_
in ancient Greek and early Christian writings. Today’s Western indus-
trial societies seem to be the only cultures in human history that lack
a common word for nwyfre.
Like the Force in the Star WarsTMmovies, nwyfre is everywhere,
but more concentrated in some things than in others. The two most
intense concentrations of nwyfre within our reach are in the Sun on
the one hand, and deep within the Earth on the other. The two aren’t
interchangeable, however, for, like water, nwyfre takes on the qualities
of the things it passes through. Nwyfre from the Sun and nwyfre from
the Earth thus have different properties and powers.
Nwyfre from the Sun fills Earth’s upper atmosphere and moves
downward. It’s stronger when the Sun is above the horizon and
strongest of all at dawn and noon, but present even at midnight. At
higher elevations, it has more force, which gives mountain air its heal-
ing properties and leads monks and hermits to choose high mountain


country for their retreats. This mode of nwyfre is called the solar cur-
rent. Its traditional mythic symbols are birds such as the eagle, the
hawk, and the heron; a technical term for it in occult writings is _aud_
or _od_.
Nwyfre from the Earth moves upward through stone and soil. It’s
strong around green plants, especially trees, and wherever water flows
from beneath the Earth; holy wells and springs blaze with it. It follows
complex cycles in time and space, shaped by lunar phases, planetary
and seasonal changes, and the subtle interplay of underground water
with stone and soil.This mode of nwyfre is traditionally called the tel-
luric current (from Tellus, an old name for the Earth). In the language
of alchemy, it’s named the mercurial current and the secret fire. Its
mythic symbols are the serpent and the dragon; occult lore calls it _aub_
or _ob_.
These two currents of energy provide the warp and weft from which
Druids weave their magic. In more than the obvious sense, they move in
opposite directions. The solar current stimulates energy centers in the
chest, throat, and hands, awakening intellect, abstract emotion, and
impersonal awareness. It is symbolically masculine and can be called the
current of wisdom.The telluric current stimulates energy centers in the
belly, pelvic basin, and feet, engendering life, love, passionate energy,
and vital force. It is symbolically feminine and can be called the current
of power.The two currents relate as Shiva and Shakti do in Hindu Tantric
lore. Shiva is absolute awareness; Shakti is absolute energy. Without
Shakti, Shiva is empty consciousness; without Shiva, Shakti is blind
force. Together, they create the universe.
It’s surprisingly easy to lose sight of this latter point. Too many
forms of spirituality exalt the solar current and its effects on the
human energy system, while condemning the telluric current and its
effects. In extreme cases, the solar current is identified with the divine
and all goodness, the telluric with the demonic and all evil. Inevitably,
some people rebel against this by reversing the interpretations, as

```
THESECONDTRIAD
```

THEDRUIDRYHANDBOOK

though it were possible to stop being dualistic by standing dualism on
its head. What’s missing is the realization that either current alone is
barren. Only when the two flow together does creation follow.
Each human being thus finds a balance between solar and telluric
energies. Despite the symbolism, physical gender has little to do with
this. Every human being partipates in both energies. Men and women
alike range from primarily solar to primarily telluric personalities,
although there’s a slight tendency for women to express the telluric
current more, while men tend to be more centered in the solar.
Popular culture in the modern Western world echoes this in an inverse
and destructive way, with gender stereotypes that entice women to
surrender their power and men to surrender their wisdom.
In this sense, then, individual human beings make the third factor
that neutralizes the binary between solar and telluric currents. Indeed,
any living thing can fill the same role.Yet the currents also combine to
produce a third current, the central secret of Druid magic.
This third current is called _aur_ and _or_ in occult writings. Some writ-
ers call it the Green Ray, although this term has other meanings. Here,
we will call it the lunar current. Its mythic symbols include the egg, the
jewel, and the child. It mediates between solar and telluric currents in
the same way that the Moon mediates between Sun and Earth. Generated
in an individual, it awakens the highest energy centers in the midbrain
and the crown of the head, bringing healing, creativity, expanded aware-
ness, and illumination. When it’s generated on a larger scale and pours
out across the land, it brings fertility, abundance, and peace.
The solar and telluric currents are primary and always present.
They existed before the first living things arose on Earth, and will
exist as long as Sun and Earth.The lunar current, by contrast, depends
on the two primary currents, just as the Moon depends on the Sun for
its light and the Earth for the stability of its orbit. Furthermore, the
lunar current must be created out of the fusion of solar and telluric
currents. It doesn’t happen by accident.


The methods by which the lunar current is created are among the
innermost teachings of Druidry, and of many other traditions as well.
Yet the whole art can be learned by watching a seed sprout and grow
into a tree. The newly sprouted seed brings sunlight and soil together
and transforms them into the substance of the growing plant. It also
brings solar and telluric currents together to form a spark of the lunar
current, or Green Ray, at its meristem, the point of new growth. In
the fusion of above and below, two become three and a new force is
brought into play. All this ties into a symbolism present in one of the
world’s most commonly read and rarely understood legends, the leg-
end of the Grail.
What is the Grail? Traditionally this was one of three questions asked
by questing knights at the Grail castle.The Grail romances don’t record
the answer, but one possibility answer can be guessed from what we’ve
already discovered. Each current has a symbolic form: the telluric cur-
rent, or secret fire, is represented by a fire-triangle with one point
upward; the solar current appears as a disk, like the Sun; the lunar cur-
rent is symbolized by a crescent or half-moon shape open toward the
top. Combine the three shapes and a familiar image appears.

```
FIGURE 4. THE SYMBOLS OF THE CURRENTS
AND THE GRAIL.

The relevance of this bit of imagery reaches deep into the Grail legend
itself, and into Druid magic as well. In the Grail romances, the
wounded Fisher King and the withered land could not save themselves

THEDRUIDRYHANDBOOK

from the terrible curse that bound them.They had to wait for a knight
to vanquish the enchantments surrounding the Grail castle and ask the
unasked question.
The kingdom of the Grail is the individual human being; on a wider
scale, it’s also the living Earth. Indeed, human greed and folly in the mod-
ern world make the Earth more and more like the Grailless lands of leg-
end with each passing year. As nature withers, our inner lives wither in
response. Living in an environment of machines and barren concrete, it’s
no wonder so many people have become barren and mechanical within.
The wonder is that some still keep a spark of the green flame alive—a
spark that someday must kindle a mighty blaze, once we make our way
through the enchantments of our own dysfunctional society and ask the
unasked questions that surround us at every moment.
Visionary scholars have described an age long past when sages had
mastered the secrets of the three currents, when the telluric current
flowed through lines traced on the landscape to sacred hills, then
leaped down prepared channels to stone circles nearby where it fused
with the solar current and sent the secret fire of the lunar current
surging outward to bless the land. Whether or not this is an accurate
image of the past, the present and future call us to work green magic
of a similar kind to heal our world. This call flashes through the heart
of the Druid path like moonlight through the bare branches of winter.

#### Stations of the Year.

The polarity between above and below—between solar and telluric
currents—defines a vertical axis around which Druidry turns.The cir-
cle Druidry traces around this axis takes its definition from other pat-
terns, however.Time rather than space, and processes of change rather


than states of energy, provide the framework for the eightfold year.
The eightfold year took many centuries to develop, and didn’t take
its present shape until modern times. Early records in Britain and else-
where show a complex, localized patchwork of calendar customs in
which no one pattern stands out. From the dawn of the Druid Revival,
however, the rising midsummer Sun at Stonehenge provided a core
image of the tradition. For many years, Druids celebrated the solstices
and equinoxes—the points of the year most clearly marked by the old
stone circles—as the four Alban Gates.This cycle is still the basic min-
imum in many traditional Druid orders, but most Druids today use a
more complex calendar instead.
Table 4 gives the eightfold year of the modern Pagan tradition.
Many people believe that this calendar dates from ancient times, but it
didn’t actually take its current form until the early 1950s, when two
English Druids, Ross Nichols and Gerald Gardner, combined the old
fourfold Druid calendar with the “cross-quarter” days—Samhuinn,
Imbolc, Belteinne, and Lughnasadh—from medieval Irish texts. The
fusion worked magnificently, producing a sacred calendar that catches
the rhythms of the natural world in a balanced cycle around the wheel
of the seasons.
Gardner, who was the creator of modern Wicca as well as a Druid
of the Ancient Druid Order, brought the new calendar into Wicca as
well. Unfortunately, like Iolo Morganwg and many others before
him, Gardner found it necessary or useful to make up stories about
the origin of his teachings, inventing ancient sources for the extraor-
dinary product of his own creative genius and his borrowings from
many contemporary traditions. Thus, generations of Wiccans and
other Pagans, faithfully handing on teachings as they received them,
have unwittingly spread inaccurate ideas about the calendar’s origin
and history.

```
THESECONDTRIAD

THEDRUIDRYHANDBOOK

Yet it bears repeating that the age of a tradition has no bearing at all
on its relevance or value. Half a century of experience has shown that
the eightfold year makes a perfect seasonal cycle of festivals for a
nature-centered spirituality. Each station of the cycle has a counter-
part on the other side of the wheel of time: winter balances summer,
spring balances fall, harvest balances planting, life balances death, all
reflecting the balance of the world of nature. A new festival comes
every six and a half weeks on average, far enough apart so that each has
its own seasonal character, close enough so that every point in the
cycle relates to the others. It’s an elegant conception, and well
deserves the importance it has gained in modern Druidry and the
modern Pagan revival as a whole.
Despite the popularity of the eightfold year, many of its potentials
have received little attention in the half century since it came into gen-
eral use. The best way to approach those potentials is to move around
to another side of the question and consider the role of gods and god-
desses in the wheel of the year.
What are the gods? Again, ask any three Druids and you’ll get at
least six answers. Theories about the nature of the gods are much dis-
cussed in some Druid circles, but don’t have the importance they have

in some other spiritual traditions. Experience, not belief, is central to
Druid spirituality, and so it actually doesn’t matter that much to
Druidry whether gods are objectively real individual divine beings,
aspects or manifestations of some overarching unity, archetypal func-
tions within the human mind, or something else entirely. What mat-
ters is that they do certain things, embody certain energies, and
appear in certain ways.
Which gods or goddesses a Druid worships is, similarly, a personal
matter based on the Druid’s personal relation to the primary powers of
the cosmos. Common patterns do exist, however. In many traditions,
eight deities from Celtic or quasi-Celtic traditions have places around
the wheel of the year, embodying the seasonal energies of the year’s
eight stations.
The deities most commonly invoked in British Druid Revival cir-
cles make up one set, with gods and goddesses alternating in a bal-
anced pattern. The descriptions and meanings given below are from
twentieth-century Druid sources.

```

Alban Arthuan Hu the Mighty, the great Druid god and

Another sequence, following the same alternation of gods and god-
desses, can be drawn readily from Old Irish mythic lore.

**FESTIVAL DEITY
Samhuinn** Morrigan, raven-goddess of war
**Alban Arthuan** Dagda Mor, king of the gods
**Imbolc** Brighid, goddess of crafts
**Alban Eiler** Aenghus Og, god of youth and love
**Belteinne** Eriu, goddess of sovereignty
**Alban Heruin** Lugh, the divine Sun-hero
**Lughnasadh** Tailtiu, goddess of agriculture
**Alban Elued** Mannanan, god of the sea
Yet a third set of gods and goddesses, assembled from a wild assort-
ment of sources, appears in the teachings of the Reformed Druids of
North America (RDNA).The RDNA is among the least doctrinaire of
Druid groups (which is saying something), and its ritual calendar, like
nearly everything else, varies wildly from grove to grove. One work-
able correspondence between gods and holy days, however, is shown
below. The alternation here is not between genders, but, broadly
speaking, between water and fire.

**FESTIVAL DEITY
Samhuinn** Llyr, god of the sea
**Alban Arthuan** Taranis, god of lightning and thunder
**Imbolc** Sirona, goddess of rivers
**Alban Eiler** Dalon ap Landu, god of groves
**Belteinne** Grannos, god of healing springs
**Alban Heruin** Belenos, god of the Sun
**Lughnasadh** Bracacia, god(dess) of malt and brewing
**Alban Elued** Danu, goddess of fertility
One of these gods, Dalon ap Landu, doesn’t appear in any earlier
source at all, and was probably invented out of whole cloth by the
Carleton College undergraduates who concocted the RDNA. What
makes this interesting is that Druids in the RDNA tradition have had


powerful experiences of Dalon ap Landu’s presence. This presents a
pretty theological puzzle: Did the god of forests, already called by so
many names, simply decide to respond to this one as well? Or did the
RDNA in some baffling way call a new god into being? Late night talk
around Druid campfires strays into matters such as these.
The Arthurian legends offer another basis for systems of this sort.
According to many scholars, they contain a good deal of Celtic Pagan
tradition in fragmentary form, and Druids have made much use of
them over the years.The knights of Camelot may not be gods, at least
as they appear in medieval romances, but they can be assigned places
at the Table Round of the year. The fair and loathly ladies of the leg-
ends also have a place at the Table, sometimes paired with their
knightly lovers, sometimes with knights who share their central char-
acteristics.

**FESTIVAL DEITY
Samhuinn** Sir Kay and Lady Cundrie
**Alban Arthuan** Sir Lancelot and Queen Guenivere
**Imbolc** Sir Bedivere and the Lady of the Lake
**Alban Eiler** Sir Galahad and Lady Dindrane
**Belteinne** Sir Tristram and Lady Iseult
**Alban Heruin** Sir Gawain and Lady Ragnall
**Lughnasadh** Sir Bors and Lady Elaine
**Alban Elued** Sir Perceval and Lady Blanchefleur
In this system, King Arthur is the Sun, illuminating the place of
each knight in turn, with Lancelot as his alter ego filling his place in
the seat of his winter birth and death.
Finally, a similar list can be compiled of saints and angels central to
the traditions of Celtic Christianity. While some people in today’s
Druid scene react heatedly to the idea, the fact remains that there have
been plenty of Christian Druids, from the first days of the Revival to
the present. There’s no good reason to exclude them from the tradi-

```
THESECONDTRIAD
```

THEDRUIDRYHANDBOOK

tion or pretend that Christian saints and angels can’t be invoked in a
Druid setting. Holy powers from Christian mythology can readily be
mapped onto a wheel of the year slightly modified to fit the traditional
church calendar, with Easter, Pentecost, and other movable feast days
shifting around the year according to Christian custom.

**FESTIVAL SAINT ORANGEL
All Hallows (1 November)** St. Peter the Apostle
**Christmas (25 December)** St. Uriel the Archangel
**Candlemas (2 February)** St. Brigid of Kildare
**Annunciation (25 March)** St. Gabriel the Archangel
**Our Lady’s Day (1 May)** St. John the Evangelist
**St. John Baptist’s Day (24 June)** St. Raphael the Archangel
**St. Mary’s Day (15 August)** St. Raphael the Archangel
**Michaelmas (29 September)** St. Michael the Archangel
It’s important to be clear about what is and isn’t being said by tabu-
lations of this sort. The common mistake to avoid here is the assump-
tion that things associated with the same thing are equal to each other.
The fact that Eriu, Sir Perceval, and St. John the Evangelist are all asso-
ciated with Belteinne doesn’t mean that these three figures are one and
the same! Rather, the goddess of sovereignty, the knight of the Grail,
and the beloved disciple all correspond to this phase of the yearly cycle,
but each expresses that symbolism in a unique way.
These correspondences, however, teach a crucial lesson.The goddess
Eriu, for example, has a special link with Belteinne, but is present
throughout the year.The same is true of all the gods, goddesses, angels,
and saints listed above. And if the knights and ladies of Camelot are seen
as personified inner forces, as indeed they should be, they also have a
place whatever the season.The same, ultimately, is true of the eight sta-
tions of the Sun themselves. Belteinne is a day in the spring, in other
words, but it’s also a pattern of energy always present in the world.
Thus the wheel of the eightfold year is not just a calendar or a
framework for rituals. It’s a cosmogram, or diagram of the universe of


human experience, traced out in time rather than space. Like other
such diagrams used in spiritual traditions—the mandalas of esoteric
Buddhism or the Cabalistic Tree of Life—the Wheel of Life, as the pat-
tern of the eightfold year may be called, provides a map of spiritual
powers and realms, a way of sorting out the complicated phenomena
of inner experience, and a chart for inner journeys from one realm of
energy to another (see figure 5). From these possibilities, much of the
deeper work of Druid magic unfolds.

```
FIGURE 5. THE DRUID WHEEL OF LIFE.

The Wheel of Life, as one might call the eightfold year in its cosmo-
grammatic form, can be filled out with symbolism as shown in Table 4,
with the gods and other powers listed as additional symbolism.
The rich symbolism of the eightfold year and the Wheel of Life cos-
mogram makes them valuable tools in modern Druidry. At the same

time, of course, the eightfold wheel of the year is not the only possi-
ble Druid calendar, nor the only one currently practiced. Many of the
older Druid orders still keep the fourfold wheel of solstices and
equinoxes as their ceremonial calendar, while some more recent tra-
ditions use a thirteen-month calendar based on the Ogham alphabet.
These and others are workable conceptions, and can be used in the
same way as the eightfold wheel as a cosmic diagram. As so often in
Druid tradition, the Awen moves where it wills, and no one rhythm
governs all the movements of its intricate dance.

#### Ogham, the Alphabet of the Trees.

The ancient Irish alphabet called Ogham (pronounced “OH-am”) pro-
vides another central theme of modern Druidry—one that operates in
harmony with the two powers and the Wheel of Life. The oldest sur-
viving Ogham writings are carved stones from the third century C.E.,
but references in Irish legend place its use well back in Pagan times
and suggest that it was normally written on wood, which rarely sur-
vives long in the wet Irish climate. According to medieval Irish Ogham
treatises preserved in the _Book of Ballymote_ , some of the letters stand
for sounds that don’t exist in the Irish language at all, which only

THEDRUIDRYHANDBOOK

deepens the mystery. Was Ogham patterned on some other writing
system, such as Latin or Greek? Or did it originate, as some modern
scholars suggest, among speakers of a pre-Celtic Irish language in
megalithic times? Nobody knows.
Whatever its origins, Ogham is an oddity among the world’s alpha-
bets. Its inscriptions read from bottom to top in vertical lines. Its
twenty basic letters, called _fews_ (Old Irish _feadha_ ), consist of tally
marks in groups of one to five—first to the right of a line, then to the
left, then diagonally across, then straight across (see figure 6). Each
group of five fews is called an _aicme_. The order of the original twenty
letters—BLNVS HDTCQ MGNgZR AOUEI—has no relation to any
other known alphabet’s order, though the first aicme seems to spell a
familiar name: BeLeNVS or Belenos, the Celtic god of light. (It’s prob-
ably not accidental that, in Christian times, the first aicme was
reordered BLVSN.) A group of five _forfedha_ (“extra letters”) with var-
ious shapes and meanings was added to the alphabet sometime later.
Weird as this may sound, the simple shapes of its letters make Ogham
an excellent alphabet for writing on wood or stone with simple tools.
The great value of Ogham to the modern Druid lies in its wealth of
symbolism. Each few is linked in old Irish lore with a tree (not all are
“trees” in the modern English sense of the word). Each few also has a
bird, a color, an agricultural tool, and an art associated with it.The old
Irish word for each of these begins with the few, and a set of animals
can readily be added along the same lines. Other symbolism has been
added in recent centuries by Druids working with the alphabet. In this
way, Ogham serves as a magical alphabet in divination, ritual, and
many other forms of Druid practice. Some purists have denounced the
additions, but the Irish Ogham texts themselves point out that stu-
dents should rework the Ogham symbols to suit their own experience
and needs.

THEDRUIDRYHANDBOOK

One detail of Ogham symbolism deserves discussion. In the 1940s,
the English poet Robert Graves came across Ogham while studying
Celtic mythology. His source, an eighteenth-century book of Irish his-
tory, listed thirteen of the fews, and Graves noticed that the trees
linked to those fews formed a seasonal sequence.With this as his start-
ing point, he worked out a thirteen-month tree calendar with twenty-
eight days to each month, and one extra day at the winter solstice
assigned to the sacred mistletoe.
Graves believed that he’d stumbled across one of the secrets of the
ancient Druids. No trace of his calendar occurs anywhere in folklore
or historical sources, however, and the very meager scraps of ancient
Celtic calendar lore that have survived suggest that the Pagan Celts
used quite different calendars.Yet the tree calendar works, and works
very well, as a Druid time-keeping tool and as a way of expanding the
symbolism of Ogham. Astrologers have even made it the basis of a new
thirteen-sign zodiac that works as well as the traditional system and
has been adopted by some modern Druids.
In other words, the equation between time and the timeless explored
earlier in this chapter works in both directions. Just as the eight holy
days can rise out of the seasonal cycle to become ever-present patterns
of meaning, the Ogham fews can descend into time’s circle and become
markers for the changes of the turning year. None of this proves that the
ancient Druids used Ogham in this way, of course.What it does prove is
that modern Druids use Ogham in this way, and find it worthwhile.
Below is an outline of the basic symbolism of the Ogham alphabet.
The animals assigned to each few are original additions based on tra-
ditional lore; the calendar attributions and one bird (the crane for
Coll) come from Robert Graves; the elements, the paths on the Wheel
of Life, and the divinatory meanings are modern. The rest of the sym-
bolism comes from the old Irish Ogham texts.The word following the
name and pronunciation of each few is the name’s literal meaning,


which (despite an assumption common in many modern circles) is not
always the name of its associated tree! The word Oghams farther down
are traditional poetic metaphors, supposedly created by the famous
judge Morann mac Main, the warrior Cu Chulainn, and the god
Aenghus Og, under his title Mac ind Óic (Son of Og). The remainder
is self-explanatory.
Much of the old lore is confusing, and not all of it has been trans-
lated satisfactorily by scholars. Comments have been added in paren-
theses where this seemed helpful. For the rest, Druids who have
studied botany know that “spp.” after a single-word scientific name of
a plant means all the species belonging to that genus; thus “ _Betula_ spp.”
means all the species of the _Betula_ , or birch, genus.

All this symbolism may seem daunting at first, but it provides a
framework of images and ideas that can be put to many uses. Spiritual
traditions around the world have long used writing systems as potent
tools for their work of inner transformation. From Cabalists working
with the subtle meanings of the Hebrew alphabet to Japanese mystics
using _kotodama_ (the secret lore of Japan’s syllabic writing system) to
unfold the hidden dimensions of Shinto, the basic approach remains
the same.
In the Druid tradition, Ogham fills the same function and can be
used in nearly all the same ways. Most of its applications belong to lev-

els of Druid practice more advanced than those this book covers, but
a solid grounding in Ogham and its symbolism builds the necessary
foundation for these levels of work. Learning the Ogham fews by sight
is essential, and getting a general sense of each few’s symbolic mean-
ings only slightly less so. Regular meditation on the fews and their
symbols, using the approach to meditation covered in chapter 6 opens
the way to many of the treasures of the Druid path.

THE THIRD

TRIAD



# THE THIRD TRIAD COVERED

here circles back to the beginning. It consists of three

great mythic figures, each linked to the others, but each

central to a myth of his own—the wizard-bard Taliesin;

Arthur, the once and future king; and Merlin the Mage,

the great archetype of the Druid. Together, they offer a

glimpse into the deeper reaches of the Druid tradition.

#### Taliesin, the Wizard Bard.

Taliesin is the archetypal bard of British myth. Less famous than
Arthur or Merlin, he has, nonetheless, been important in Druid tradi-
tion since the beginning of the Revival, and before then had a central
place in the Welsh Druid renaissance of the Middle Ages.The youngest
of the triad according to British folk tradition,Taliesin comes first here
because his tale defines the core pattern of Druid initiation.

THEDRUIDRYHANDBOOK

The wise sorceress Ceridwen had two children: a daughter named
Creirwy, the loveliest of girls, and a son named Afagddu, the ugliest of
boys. To compensate her son for his ugliness, Ceridwen set out to
make him the wisest person alive. She brewed a potion of wisdom for
him in a great cauldron, gathering herbs by the seasons and the move-
ments of the stars. Gwion, a poor orphan boy from a nearby village,
was set to stir the potion, which needed a year and a day to brew.
When the year and a day was up, three drops of the boiling brew flew
out of the cauldron and landed on Gwion’s thumb.
The boy put his thumb in his mouth to stanch the pain of the burn
and, in that instant, all the virtue of the potion passed into him. He
knew everything there was to know—including the fact that
Ceridwen would kill him once she learned what had happened.
Calling on his newfound magical wisdom, he changed himself into a
fleet hare and sped away.
The sorceress soon arrived and, realizing what had happened,
changed herself into a greyhound and went in pursuit. Before the
hound could catch him, Gwion ran to the water’s edge, turned himself
into a fish, and swam away. Ceridwen could not be foiled so easily; she
turned herself into an otter and darted after him. Before she could
catch him, he leapt into the air, turned himself into a bird, and flew off.
A moment later, Ceridwen became a hawk and gave chase. With no
other hiding place in sight, Gwion dove toward a pile of grain on a
threshing floor and turned himself into a single grain of wheat.
Ceridwen at once became a hen, leapt on the grain of wheat, and swal-
lowed it.
A short time later, to her dismay, she found that she was pregnant.
Knowing the child was Gwion, she planned to put him to death when
he was born, but the infant was so beautiful she couldn’t bear to do so.
Instead, she tied him in a leather sack, tossed him into the river Dyfi,
and let the waters take him to his destiny.


Downstream on the Dyfi lay a weir owned by Gwyddno Garanhir,
the king of that country. Gwyddno had a son named Elffin who had
been plagued by misfortune since his birth. In the hope that some
good fortune might come his way, the king set Elffin to watch the weir
for a year, with the right to take anything that washed up there.
Nothing of value appeared until the day that the leather sack carrying
Gwion drifted into the weir. Elffin opened the sack, wondering what
might lie within, and found a beautiful newborn boy with light shin-
ing about his head. “Behold a shining brow ( _tal iesin_ ),” he said aloud,
and was astonished when the baby replied, “Taliesin be it,” accepting
the words as his name. Elffin took the infant to his wife, who nursed
the child and cared for it as though he were her own. From that
moment on, all Elffin’s misfortune changed to good and the child
Taliesin became his household bard.
It happened some time later that Maelgwn, the high king of North
Wales, was holding court at Degannwy, surrounded by his nobles and
warriors and a great crowd of fawning bards who flattered him con-
stantly. Elffin went there and, in the midst of the flattery, commented
to another guest that, while only a king could compete with a king, he
had a wife as faithful as any lady in the kingdom, and a bard wiser than
all the bards of the king.
This was repeated to King Maelgwn, who flung Elffin into prison
until he could prove the truth of his boasts. Maelgwn sent his son,
Rhun, to seduce Elffin’s wife by trickery, but, thanks to Taliesin’s
advice, the trick was turned back on Rhun. Then Taliesin went to
Degannwy, entered the castle unnoticed, sat in a corner, and cast a
spell on all King Maelgwn’s bards so that they could do nothing but
play “blerwm blerwm” on their lips with their fingers. The king,
incensed, had one of his squires hit Heinin, the chief bard, over the
head with a broom. This broke the spell and Heinin begged the king’s
forgiveness, explaining that a spirit in the form of a child had cast an
enchantment on him.

```
THETHIRDTRIAD
```

THEDRUIDRYHANDBOOK

King Maelgwn then sent for Taliesin and asked who he was and
whence he came. The child-bard replied in a brilliant cascade of poet-
ic riddles that left the king’s bards utterly baffled, then asked the king
to free Elffin. When Maelgwyn refused, Taliesin summoned a wind so
fierce that it terrified the king into sending for his prisoner. Taliesin
then conjured the shackles off Elffin with another incantation, and
bard and prince went home in triumph.

Like most of the old British legends, the tale of Taliesin wanders
freely across the misty borders between myth and history. Taliesin
himself was a bard of the late sixth century and the author of some of
the oldest classical Welsh poetry. King Maelgwn of North Wales was
equally historical, and the early Welsh chronicler Nennius mentions
his fawning bards. King Gwyddno Garanhir and his son Elffin are more
problematic, since the old chronicles claim that Gwyddno’s kingdom
was west of the present shores of central Wales, in territory since sub-
merged by the Irish Sea. Modern scientists admit the eastern half of
the Irish Sea was dry land in geologically recent times, but date its
drowning no later than 1800 B.C.E.—though modern scientists have
been wrong before. As for Ceridwen and the more magical dimen-
sions of the legend, it’s hard to find an obvious place for these outside
of the timeless realm of wonder tale.
The tale of Taliesin has much to offer modern Druids, although
many of its lessons can only be unfolded through meditation. Clearly,
it has much to say about the importance of the bardic arts of poetry
and music in Druidry, both in ancient times and today.Yet the events
that changed the ignorant child Gwion into the wizard-poet Taliesin
also echo traditions of mystical initiation found all over the world, in
which aspirants pass through a transformative process that teaches
them to awaken the subtle powers hidden within them.
Gwion first spends a year and a day patiently stirring the cauldron


at Ceridwen’s bidding. Next, he passes through three transformative
journeys that echo the pattern of the three Druid elements: the hare
on the earth for calas, the fish in running water for gwyar, and the bird
in open air for nwyfre.Then, drawing inward into the core of himself,
he becomes a seed and spends nine months in the womb of Ceridwen.
Finally, reborn and nameless, he passes through the last ordeal of the
waters and awakens into power and vision, with the radiance of the
Moon center shining at his brow and all knowledge at his command.
This sequence can be found in the mystical traditions of many places
and times, and it also maps closely onto the customs of traditional
bardic schools in Ireland and the Scottish highlands in the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries. Here, novice bards began training outside the
school by mastering reading, writing, and grammar—stirring the caul-
dron of speech until the drops of Awen were ready to leap from it.Then
they passed an examination and entered the bardic school for intensive
training.
This training took a distinctive form. Students were given a subject
and a traditional verse form, and retired to unlit, windowless rooms
to work out their poems; one Scottish account describes poets lying
with plaids wrapped around their heads and heavy stones resting on
their bellies. After a full day or more in darkness and silence, they
brought their verses to the teacher for correction or approval. The
process was repeated five days a week for the term of the school,
which ran, in seventeenth-century Ireland, from autumn to spring
equinox. Students attended for six or seven years, then graduated and
sought a position as household bard to some noble family.
Taliesin’s nine months in the womb of Ceridwen was just such a
retreat into silence and darkness, while the gift of poetry ripened
within him. The wise sorceress Ceridwen can be seen as the school or
the bardic tradition itself—the foster-mother of all true poets. Yet
here again there are deeper dimensions, for Taliesin’s powers are not

```

THEDRUIDRYHANDBOOK

simply those of a bard, or even a master bard. He shares an ability to
take animal shapes and summon the winds with the Druids of Irish
legend, and his radiant brow places him among holy men and women
of many other places and times—initiates whose halos, flames, or
horns of light symbolize the awakening of the upper psychic centers.
Thus Taliesin is a bard, but also more than a bard, and he is initiated
not simply into the mysteries of the bardic craft, but into a deeper
awakening.
As modern Druids have pointed out more than once, the three
stages of Taliesin’s initiation take place in any form of spiritual train-
ing. There is always a time of patient practice, stirring the cauldron
while the potion brews; there is always a sudden awakening into
knowledge and power, and the cascade of transformations that fol-
lows; and there is always a retreat into silence and stillness while the
process of inner development runs its course.
The three phases of enlightenment rarely follow this neat sequence,
however. More commonly, spiritual practice tumbles from one to
another and back again—one day, slow patient plodding; the next, a
sudden leap of insight; the one after that, a seemingly empty time of
inward silence, the conscious self flailing about rudderless as deeper
levels take care of the work only they can do. Sometimes all three
stages happen at once.
The same three stages, finally, define the framework for the system
of Druid training taught in this book. As mentioned earlier, this system
centers on three core factors, or paths. The first, the Earth Path, chal-
lenges you to seek a life more in harmony with nature; here the patient
stirring of the cauldron is central. The second, the Sun Path, leads you
to celebrate the changing seasons of the year; here the natural world
moves through Gwion’s shapeshifting flight and sweeps up humanity in
its changes. The third, the Moon Path, guides you in the practice of
meditation; here the stillness of Ceridwen’s womb provides a place in
which the hidden depths of awareness slowly reveal themselves.


The legend has many other lessons to teach, and Druid Revival
writers have explored some of these over the last three centuries.
Still, a legend such as this is an experience to be embraced, not a puz-
zle to be solved. Let go of the interpretations suggested here, and read
back over the tale again. What does it communicate to you? What les-
sons does it offer?

#### Arthur, the Once and Future King.

Arthur has a much wider reputation than Taliesin—King of the
Britons, master of the Table Round, wielder of Excalibur, initiate of
Merlin’s mysteries, he stands at the pivot of the world’s greatest cycle
of heroic legends. For hundreds of years, most accounts of Britain’s
past have had to come to terms with him in one way or another, and
three centuries of Druid Revival efforts have woven him and the
diverse strands of the Arthurian legend into the fabric of modern
Druidry.
Who is Arthur? Most modern historians accept that behind the
ornate embroidery of the medieval legend lies the reality of a British
military commander in the late fifth and early sixth centuries of the
Common Era. The Welsh chronicler Nennius, whose book is the old-
est known source to mention Arthur, calls him _dux bellorum_ (“war
leader”) rather than king, and recounts nine battles in which he
defended Britain against Saxon invaders. Archeologists and historians
confirm that Saxon expansion in Britain came to a sudden halt at the
end of the fifth century and took more than fifty years to get started
again. That period of successful resistance, unparalleled anywhere else
during the fall of the Roman Empire, has been called “the Arthurian fact.”
Measured by its historical results, that fact was of immense scale.

```
THETHIRDTRIAD
```

THEDRUIDRYHANDBOOK

Elsewhere in Europe, barbarian invasions led to total collapse as
Roman authority went to pieces and nothing took its place. The fifty-
year reprieve won by Arthur’s battles allowed a shieldwall of Celtic
kingdoms—Cornwall, Wales, Rheged, Dalriada, and others—to take
shape amid the catastrophic implosion of Roman power. Behind that
shieldwall lay Ireland, where monks preserved the heritage of classical
civilization and passed it on to the rest of Western Europe in the cen-
turies that followed. Had Arthur failed, the Saxons might easily have
swept straight across Britain to the Irish Sea and ravaged Ireland in
turn. Without the Arthurian fact, there might well have been nothing
to light new lamps in the Western world as the Dark Ages closed in.
The impact of the historical Arthur was more than matched by the
growth of his legend. Stories doubtless gathered around the histori-
cal Arthur while he still lived, and his death in battle in the year 532
gave the legend unstoppable momentum. In Wales, Cornwall, and
Brittany, descendants of the people Arthur defended remained polit-
ically independent for centuries and preserved their cultural identity
straight through to the present day. Tales of Arthur formed part of
that identity, and grew in the telling. Some 600 years after Arthur’s
time, the tales reached the ears of French and Norman poets, who
recognized a gold mine when they heard it and shaped the Arthurian
legend into its finished form.
The result was a tapestry woven from wildly diverse sources.
Glimpses of the historical Arthur and his struggles with Saxon
invaders show through now and again, mostly in early romances such
as Geoffrey of Monmouth’s _History of the Kings of Britain_ .The canons of
medieval literary taste play a larger role, with details of court life and
knightly combat from the Middle Ages obscuring the context of a
Dark Ages warlord. Still, strange things found their way into the
romances. Giants, goddesses, wizards, and bizarre quests wedged
themselves into the growing legend, and the knights of the Table


Round in their shining armor rode through a landscape dominated by
powers of an older world.
William Blake put his finger squarely on this deeper dimension of
Arthurian legend in an 1809 essay: “The giant Albion, was patriarch of
the Atlantic; he is the Atlas of the Greeks, one of those the Greeks
called Titans. The stories of Arthur are the acts of Albion, applied to a
prince of the fifth century.”^6 What Blake was suggesting is plausible
enough: behind the historic Arthur, the “prince of the fifth century,”
stands an ancient mythology.
In his 1971 study _Camelot and the Vision of Albion_ , Arthurian scholar
Geoffrey Ashe proposed that Blake’s visionary guess was precisely
correct. Much of Arthur’s legend, Ashe argued, makes no sense as
distorted history, but plenty of sense as half-remembered mythology.
In the twilight years of British Paganism, myth turned to legend as old
gods gave way to new heroes; the process has happened many times
before and since. Behind the Arthurian legend, then, lies the
Arthurian myth as well as the Arthurian fact.
This shows up all through Arthur’s legendary biography, and, above
all, in the mystery of his fate. Early sources record his death in the bat-
tle of Camlann in 532, but within a short time, strange stories began
to circulate. “Not wise the thought, a grave for Arthur,” comments an
old Welsh proverb. By the twelfth century, people in Brittany,
Cornwall, and Wales insisted that Arthur was not dead, but had gone
to a hidden isle in the West and would someday return.
This story reaches deep into mythic levels of consciousness and has
echoes in the legends of many lands. Classical myths refer to the god
Saturn, who ruled a golden age in the distant past before being
dethroned by Jupiter, and who slept in an island to the far west; some
tales suggested that, like Arthur, he might someday return. The Welsh
legend of the titanic Bran the Blessed, whose head lived on for years
after his death in an island to the west of Britain, is another working
of the same mythic patterns.

THEDRUIDRYHANDBOOK

Insights of this sort have led some scholars to attempt to tease out
the original mythology from within the tangles of Arthurian legend,
just as other scholars have tried to extract the actual history of the
Dark Age chieftain from the same source. From a Druid perspective,
these efforts risk missing the value of the legend as it actually exists.
Most of these reconstructions simply retell the old stories in the lan-
guage of today’s intellectual fashion, leaving out anything that doesn’t
fit whatever model the author fancies.
Between history and myth, however, lies the legend itself, in all its
complexity and power. The same attitude toward myth discussed ear-
lier is just as relevant to more complex legends. Like the story of the
three rays of light, the stories of Arthur are important because of what
they teach. Arthur is Everyman, and the knights and ladies of his court
are the powers of the soul, its actions and passions. At the same time,
Arthur is Arth Fawr, the Great Bear, pivot of the starry heavens, and
his Table Round is the wheel of stars; the knights and ladies of his court
are vast cosmic powers projected downward onto the screen of human
life. The same is true of every great cycle of heroic legend: as above,
so below.
As the story of Taliesin provides Druidry with its model of initia-
tion, the stories of Arthur provide it with symbols and narratives for
the world into which the initiate enters. The weird ambivalence of
Arthurian legend—half of it in the brightly lit world of medieval
pageantry, half of it in a wider realm where vast archaic shapes move
half-seen in twilight—matches the experience of generations of mod-
ern Druids, who live every moment in both the everyday world of
industrial society and the greater realm of primal spiritual powers.
As in the legends and in the reality of Druid life, the richness comes
from the fusion of the two worlds. Some spiritual teachings attempt to
escape from ordinary life into a purely spiritual existence, mirroring the
modern secular philosophies that attempt to abandon the spirit in favor


of a wholly material existence. Druid tradition supports neither of these
unbalanced paths. Rather, sacred and secular, spiritual and material
blend constructively in Druid practice, with the additional factor of cre-
ativity and the arts turning the binary into a balanced ternary.
The figure of Arthur holds another lesson for Druids as well. The
Arthurian legends have their roots in a time when events could have
moved in many ways, and one brave leader and his supporters tipped
the balance of history. The historical Arthur did not simply live in the
world; he helped shape it. It’s probably not an accident that modern
Druids, whose paths draw deeply on Arthurian lore, have been in the
forefront of many progressive causes down through the years. Some
have tried to influence the political process in one way or another.
More common, and usually more successful, have been efforts by
Druids to change the world through the force of personal example,
through living the change they hope to make in the world.
The image of kingship, expressed and symbolized in the figure of
Arthur, is important to many modern Druids for this reason. This has
nothing to do with the tepid reality of the world’s surviving monar-
chies, much less with antidemocratic political stances of the sort that
infest some other spiritual traditions. Rather, it represents a deep
awareness of the possibilities within each human individual. The
English word “king” was originally _cyning_ , literally “he of the kin,”
while “queen,” anciently _cwen_ , meant simply “woman.”The king was _the_
member of his kin, the queen _the_ woman, not in an exclusive sense,
but simply because he or she had the task of embodying the full poten-
tial of humanity to his or her people.
Thus, in a Druid sense, every man is a king and every woman a
queen, since each human being has the capacity to burst free of the
limits of time and place, and express something of the immense pos-
sibilities contained within the human body, mind, and spirit. In an age
when the collective imagination of humanity stands at a low ebb, when

media and the makers of opinion lure the unwary with an image of
humanity reduced to a cog in the machinery of consumption, the fig-
ure of Arthur reminds Druids that their path embraces the immense
challenge of becoming fully and magnificently human.
This is one lesson of the ancient title borne by Arthur and the kings
of his line. The word _Pendragon_ literally means “head or chief dragon.”
While the dragon is among the most complex of all mythic symbols, it
has two principal meanings in Druid tradition. It represents the hidden
energies and potentials within the land, the dragon currents of the
Earth, but it also represents the hidden powers and possibilities within
the self, the dragon fire that lies sleeping within the core of each indi-
vidual. An essential part of Druid teaching is that these two meanings
aren’t really separate, for nature is inside us as well as around us at each
moment. Each of us, each living being, is an expression of the life of
Earth, part of a greater unity. Our awakening into wisdom brings heal-
ing to the Earth, and ultimately brings the Earth itself closer to the ful-
fillment of its own tremendous destiny.

#### Merlin, the Mage.

Merlin was archmage of Britain and the initiator of the young Arthur.
Most people these days who think they know about Merlin see him
complete with pointed hat, long white beard, a robe spangled with
moons and stars, and a Harry Potter-esque owl on his shoulder, all
borrowed from recent media portrayals. A closer look at the original
tales reveals a far more complex figure whose legend teaches lessons
of great power and wisdom.
Merlin first appears in Welsh sources as the poet Myrddin, author
of several enigmatic Welsh poems traditionally dating from the sixth
century. Scraps of information preserved in chronicles and poems


sketch a dim but extraordinary image: madman, seer, and poet,
dwelling beneath a magical apple tree in a forest in what is now south-
ern Scotland, with wolves and wild pigs as his companions. His name
resonates far back into Pagan times, perhaps into Druid tradition;
according to Welsh sources, the original name of Britain before it was
first inhabited by human beings was _Clas Myrrdin_ , “Merlin’s Enclosure.”
In the twelfth century, Geoffrey of Monmouth, author of _The
History of the Kings of Britain_ and _The Life of Merlin_ , drew on these tra-
ditions (among many other things) to rework the shadowy figure of
Myrddin into an archetypal form of immense power. In Geoffrey’s
tale, the tyrant and usurper Vortigern, one of the supreme villains of
British legend, sought to cement his power over the British kingdom
by building a stronghold at Dinas Ffaraon in the mountains of north-
ern Wales, but the work of each day fell to the ground each night.
Vortigern’s magicians told him that the walls would not stand until the
blood of a child with no father was sprinkled on the stones. Enter
Merlin—Geoffrey’s reworking of the Welsh name, probably chosen to
avoid a pun on the French obscenity _merde_ —born of a Welsh princess
seduced by a spirit, who turns the tables on his would-be sacrificers.
Presently, the boy Merlin was brought before the king. He chal-
lenged the magicians to explain why the walls fell each night. When
they admitted their ignorance, he told the king to have his workmen
dig beneath the site, foretelling that they would find an underground
pool containing two fighting dragons—one red, one white.The work-
men uncovered the pool, and the dragons soared up into the sky and
battled each other until the red one conquered the white. Merlin then
prophesied Vortigern’s death, foretold the return of the rightful king,
Aurelius, and spoke of a greater king to come.
All these things duly happened: Aurelius and his brother, Uther,
returned from exile;Vortigern was trapped and burned to death in his
mountain stronghold; and Uther, with Merlin’s help, fathered the

future King Arthur on the wife of his vassal, Gorlois of Cornwall.This
last event marks Merlin’s final appearance in the _History of the Kings of
Britain_ ; _The Life of Merlin_ relates his life long after Arthur’s death. Here,
the image of the mad poet in the forest abruptly replaces the prophet
and mage, and images from the ancient Welsh poems take a leading
role. Despite its title, the _Life_ recounts only a few years late in Merlin’s
life, as he faces the deaths of friends in battle, flees to the woods in
grief and madness, and finds his way back to sanity through a profound
process of transformation.Taliesin appears in Geoffrey’s _Life_ as a friend
and younger contemporary of Merlin. In one powerful scene, the two
reminisce about their voyage over the sea with the wounded Arthur to
an island in the West.
The image of Merlin that became most popular in later years—the
wise teacher and counselor of King Arthur—appears nowhere in
Geoffrey’s account. That came with later writers of Arthurian leg-
end—especially Robert de Boron, whose romance _Merlin_ appeared
around 1200 and set the tone for nearly all subsequent accounts of the
wizard. De Boron’s Merlin arranges for Arthur’s conception and
upbringing, and stage-manages the events that lead the young prince
to his destined throne. Child of a demon and a holy virgin, Merlin has
powers and habits like those of Taliesin: he knows past and future,
changes his shape, and commands the elements; he plays magical
pranks on those around him, but displays a fierce loyalty to those he
chooses to serve.
Merlin’s death is recounted variously in the romances. The most
popular version today—his entombment beneath a stone by the trick-
ery of Nimue—seems to have been invented late in the legend’s evo-
lution. Older stories tell stranger tales. The Didot _Perceval_ , one of the
oldest surviving versions of the Grail legend, tells that Merlin could
not die until the world’s end, and instead retreated into a mysterious
_esplumoir_ near the hermitage of Perceval, never to be seen again.What
an esplumoir might be has been much debated by scholars. The most


likely suggestion makes it the cage in which moulting falcons were
kept until they regained their feathers—a pun on Merlin’s name,
which is also the name of a variety of falcon.
Geoffrey of Monmouth’s _Life of Merlin_ never describes his death, but
has him withdraw in old age to an observatory with seventy windows
in the depths of the forest, possibly another version of the esplumoir
legend. Still another account from Welsh lore claims that Merlin and
the thirteen treasures of Britain now wait in a house of glass in the
ocean’s depths. A dissonant note comes from two accounts in a
medieval manuscript now in the British Library that identify a mad
wilderness-dwelling figure named Lailoken as Merlin and recount his
threefold death by being simultaneously hit with stones, pierced with
a stake, and drowned in a stream.
What is one to make of this torrent of myth, folktale, and garbled
history? Scholars, occultists, and Druids have wrestled with that ques-
tion with varying results. Several writers suggest that Myrddin, or
Merlin, was a title rather than a personal name, and tease out two pos-
sibly historical figures from the legend. The first, Myrddin Emrys, or
Merlinus Ambrosius, lived in southern Wales and Cornwall in the late
fifth and early sixth centuries C.E. He was teacher and counselor to
the historical Arthur. The second, Myrddin Wyllt, or Merlinus
Caledonius, lived almost a century later in southern Scotland and
retired to a forest hermitage after the death of his patron King,
Gwenddolau, in the battle of Arderydd in 573 C.E. The confusion in
Geoffrey’s books and their sources becomes a good deal clearer with
this distinction in place, but it’s still merely a hypothesis.
As with the other figures we’ve examined, Merlin moves at will
through a territory in which myth, history, and spiritual teaching
blur.That a person named Myrddin played an important part in sixth-
century Britain seems likely, although his relation to the Arthurian
fact is anyone’s guess. That there may be a Pagan god behind much of
the Merlin legend also seems likely, although any attempt to recover

his symbols and myths strays quickly into speculation. Unquestionably,
however, there is a legendary wizard named Merlin, whose complex
biography has much to teach modern Druids.
If the legend of Taliesin shows the Druid way of initiation, and the
tales of Arthur describe the world in which Druids walk, the stories of
Merlin speak of Druids themselves. It’s surely no accident that
Merlin’s distinctive character—acerbic yet benevolent, masterful yet
humble, a little frightening yet sometimes a little ridiculous, and
always wryly amused by the antics of those around him—appears time
and again in the great figures of the Druid tradition. As Geoffrey also
reminds us, to the end of his life, Merlin remained open to change and
new insight. He never fell into the trap of thinking that he knew it all.
Merlin’s relationship with magic raises points that are deeply rele-
vant to modern Druidry. While modern media portray him as a sor-
cerer, the old legends draw a more complex picture of his powers. In
his confrontation with Vortigern, Merlin acts as prophet and seer, not
magician; his gift is not power, but rather knowledge of hidden things
and meanings. In _The Life of Merlin_ , he begins with the same gift and
opens up its deeper potentials, slowly developing from seer to
philosopher and sage. Even in later literature, from Robert de Boron
to Thomas Malory and beyond, Merlin’s wisdom and knowledge of the
unseen are usually more important than his power to shape the world
through incantations and spells.
One lesson this teaches is that magic, in the strict sense of the
word, isn’t essential to the Druid path. Magic was usefully defined by
British occultist Dion Fortune as the art and science of causing
changes in consciousness in accordance with will. The elaborate trap-
pings of magic—colors, numbers, geometrical forms, words of
power, incense, candles—are simply convenient tools that allow magi-
cians to focus their minds in certain ways and draw on powers of con-
sciousness that modern industrial culture doesn’t understand very


well. Classical and Irish sources agree that ancient Druids practiced
magic, and some Druids today do as well.
Yet the heart of the tradition lies elsewhere. Since the beginning of
the Revival, the core element of Druid spiritual practice has been
meditation, not magic. Like Merlin himself, modern Druids have
made wisdom rather than power the center of their work.This unfolds
from the fundamental ideas of Revival Druidry. The Druid quest to
understand and move in harmony with nature leads inevitably to a
quest to understand our own nature, and meditation holds the key to
this quest. The quest for self-knowledge certainly combines well with
magical training, but it also combines equally well with other disci-
plines—the bardic arts of music and poetry, systems of natural heal-
ing, and “soft” martial arts such as aikido and t’ai chi ch’uan, all of
which are highly popular among modern Druids. Meditation and the
quest for self-knowledge remain the living center of the tradition, and
open the way to its deepest dimensions.
This lesson is reinforced by the legendary accounts of Merlin’s
strange fate. Mystical traditions around the world tell of people who
remain powers in the inner realms of the human mind and spirit long
after withdrawing from physical life. Some of these accounts echo
Merlin’s tales with curious exactness. Japanese Buddhists of the eso-
teric Shingon tradition believe that the first great Shingon master,
Kobo Daishi, waits in eternal meditation within the sacred mountain,
Koyasan, while still mysteriously appearing to those in need who call
on him for aid. The legendary founder of the Rosicrucian order,
Christian Rosenkreutz, is said to lie deep in contemplation in a hidden
vault with seven sides beneath Mount Abiegnus, the Mountain of Fir
Trees—a guiding presence for all who follow the Rosicrucian path.
Similar accounts surround Hermes Trismegistus, traditionally the first
teacher of occult wisdom in the West, and many other figures from
myth and sacred history.

Merlin, in his esplumoir of many windows, is another such figure,
as is Arthur himself. Legends from across the British Isles claim that
Arthur and his knights lie asleep in a cave within some local hill. This
cluster of archetypal images suggests again the hidden unity connect-
ing the dragon power of the land with the dragon power of the self—
for, of course, Merlin is also associated with dragons, since his vision
of dragons rising and battling in the winds above Dinas Ffaraon
marked both the awakening of his own prophetic powers and the surg-
ing forces within the land that brought the age of Arthur into being.
Yet there’s a more straightforward lesson in these same figures. Like
all the world’s mystical traditions, Druidry teaches that each human
being contains potentials beyond anything we can imagine.We are each
an esplumoir in which a Merlin waits, a hollow hill in which an Arthur
lies sleeping. To recognize this is to take the first great step toward the
awakening of vast powers within the silent places of the self.


#### Further Reading.

All the subjects covered in Part II have a sizeable literature of their
own, and many students of Druidry end up acquiring a fair collection
of books about them. Some books that should not be missed are these:
Geoffrey Ashe, _Camelot and the Vision of Albion_ (London: Heinemann,
1971). A seminal work by one of the premier Arthurian scholars of the
twentieth century, exploring the mythic dimensions of the legends of
Arthur.
Steve Blamires, _Celtic Tree Mysteries_ (St. Paul: Llewellyn, 1997). A
capable study of the treelore and magical traditions associated with the
Ogham fews, with useful practical exercises.
George Calder, _Auraicept na n-Eces:The Scholars’ Primer_ (Edinburgh:
John Grant, 1917). Preserved in the medieval _Book of Ballymote_ , this
standard textbook of Irish bardic schools preserves most of the surviv-
ing Ogham lore. Essential for the Druid scholar.
Robert Lee “Skip” Ellison, _The Druid’s Alphabet_ (Earth Religions
Press, 2003). A convenient handbook of traditional Ogham lore by the
Archdruid of Ar nDraiocht Fein (ADF), one of the liveliest of contem-
porary Druid organizations.
Geoffrey of Monmouth, _The History of the Kings of Britain_ (London:
Penguin, 1966). The original Arthurian bestseller, this book was first
published in 1136. It covers not only Arthur, but an entire mythic his-
tory of Britain from its first settling by Brutus the Trojan to the death
of Cadwallader, the last Celtic king of Britain. An essential starting
place for anyone interested in the Arthurian legends.
Gareth Knight, _The Secret Tradition in Arthurian Legend_
(Wellingborough, Northamptonshire: Aquarian, 1983). Based on the
work of English magician Dion Fortune and her magical order, the
Society of the Inner Light, this book covers the whole sweep of
Arthurian legend from the standpoint of Western occult philosophy.
Essential.

material bearing on most of the topics raised here.Very much a mixed
bag, but each volume contains treasures.
Damian McManus, _A Guide to Ogam_ (Maynooth: An Sagart, 1991).
The academic state of the art in Ogham studies, this volume presents
most of what is currently known about the origins, history, and devel-
opment of the ancient script of the Druids. Some of the linguistic
material is heavy going for the ordinary reader.
Paul Rhys Mountfort, _Ogam:The Celtic Oracle of the Trees_ (Rochester,

comprehensive study of Druid lore by one of the major figures of the
twentieth-century tradition. A complex and demanding book requir-
ing careful study and meditation; an astonishing amount of lore is
packed into it.
O’Boyle, Sean, _Ogam: The Poet’s Secret_ (Dublin: Gilbert Dalton,
1980). A study of Ogham as a possible notation for music, based on
old Irish harp traditions. Rare, but worth finding.

the origins of modern Druidry and examined the core con-

cepts of its philosophy and symbolism. But learning about

Druidry is one thing; becoming a Druid is another.The first

often leads to the second, but the passage entails a leap

from history and lore to the actual challenges of Druidry as

a living path. You can study the Druid tradition in a

detached, intellectual way, but initiation into Druidry

demands the participation of the whole self. In Part III, we

will explore three paths that lead to the sacred grove of

Druidry:The Earth Path, the Sun Path, and the Moon Path.

Each of the three paths provides a core element of a

Druid way of life. The Sun Path responds to the need for

participation in the great cycles of nature and spirit; the

Moon Path answers the need for self-knowledge and a

way of developing the subtle potentials of the self. The two together

offer a balanced system of natural spirituality. Yet spirit must express

itself in the world of matter or it accomplishes nothing. Insights from

meditation and ceremony gain their full power and meaning when

reflected in the details of everyday life. A spirituality based on rever-

ence for nature thus finds its full expression in a life in harmony with

the living Earth itself and this is the essence of the Earth Path.
The Earth Path is the path toward living in harmony with nature.
Since the beginning of the Revival, Druids have taken issue with the
unnatural habits of a civilization alienated from the living Earth. As
industrial society moved further out of balance with nature, Druids
responded creatively, finding ways to restore the balance in their own
lives and communities. Those responses are even more necessary
today.
At the same time, the effort to return to a more natural way of
living provides fertile soil in which nature spirituality can flower and
bear fruit. Mystics and sages have pointed out for centuries that
mindless pursuit of wealth, power, and luxury gets in the way of
spirituality and, indeed, inhibits ordinary happiness as well. Since
“mindless pursuit of wealth, power, and luxury” is a fair capsule
description of modern industrial society, and middle-class people in
the industrial world today have more wealth, power, and luxury at
their disposal than the average medieval king, this bit of traditional
wisdom has even more relevance today.
Concerns of this sort have helped create a new movement toward
saner lifestyles under the label of “voluntary simplicity.” The voluntary
simplicity movement, when it hasn’t been debased into a sales pitch
for yet another round of allegedly simple consumer products, has
much to offer the Druid tradition. Its proponents make a compelling
case that people in the developed world have cluttered their lives with
so many possessions and surrendered so much of their time to buying,


maintaining, and paying for them that there’s no room left for spiritu-
ality, community, relationships, personal development, or simple hap-
piness. They propose replacing the rat race of endless consumption
with a life that’s outwardly simple and inwardly rich, and have evolved
useful tools for sorting out the difference between needs and wants,
getting off the treadmill of consumption for its own sake, and moving
toward a less cluttered lifestyle. These can be a valuable part of any
Druid’s Earth Path.
The Druid vision reaches beyond these issues, however, into an
intense awareness of humanity’s connection with the living Earth. It’s
important to move away from modern habits of mindless consump-
tion, but it’s equally important to challenge the ways of thinking that
underlie those habits. The most important of these misunderstandings
is the notion that human beings are somehow outside nature, free of its
laws and without any need of its gifts. Even in the most straightforward
practical sense, this assumption is as misguided as it is arrogant.The air
we breathe, the water we drink, the soil and weather that produce our
food, and around $33 trillion a year in free services to the global econ-
omy—around three times the value of _all_ human economic activity—
are produced for us moment by moment by natural cycles in the
Earth’s biosphere.
Yet human connections with nature reach in other directions as
well. Until a few centuries ago, nearly everyone lived their lives in
intimate contact with nature and its cycles. Our minds and spirits, as
well as our bodies, evolved in that context, shaped by the rhythms of
the living Earth. Researchers in the new discipline of ecopsychology
have shown that human beings are never quite sane when they’re iso-
lated from natural environments. Some of the more perceptive writ-
ers on voluntary simplicity suggest that our society’s frantic search for
new sensations, new products, and new lifestyles gets its power from
a vague but pervasive sense that we’ve lost something essential. The

```
THEEARTHPAT H
```

THEDRUIDRYHANDBOOK

Druid vision suggests that what’s been lost is a living connection with
nature, as essential to human life as sunlight, rain, and soil are to the
life of a tree.
The Earth Path presented here thus has two major aspects: recon-
necting with nature through study and nature awareness, and moving
toward greater harmony with nature through carefully considered
changes in everyday life to remove barriers that separate you from
nature and lighten your impact on the living Earth.
These concerns become more serious in the light of today’s ecolog-
ical crisis. Fantasies about infinite material power and wealth are dys-
functional enough by themselves. On a finite, fragile planet, they
become forces that push Earth’s human and natural systems alike
against unyielding planetary limits. Every aspect of the biosphere faces
growing strain today, and those strains drive wild swings in planetary
systems that impact our lives more disastrously each year. From cli-
mate shifts and violent weather caused by global warming, to fisheries
and forests ravaged by overharvesting, to new diseases launched into
the world by the disruption of tropical environments, natural balances
essential to humanity’s well-being are spinning out of kilter.
At the same time, many of the resources on which humanity now
depends—especially petroleum, the hydrocarbon lifeblood of indus-
trial society—are running dangerously low.There’s no shortage of talk
about solutions, to be sure, but most of the proposed solutions call for
more of the same dysfunctional habits driving the crisis: pump more,
burn more, produce more, pollute more. Meanwhile, no one does
anything to put the proposed solutions into effect, or even test them
to find out if they work on a large enough scale to make a difference.
Politicians pursue business as usual and business leaders drag their
feet, while problems multiply and options narrow. It’s a recipe for a
very ugly future.
Many people who are aware of these problems believe they them-


selves can’t do anything about them. Yet the dirty little secret of the
ecological crisis is that it results from choices made by ordinary peo-
ple.To a remarkable degree, the governments and corporations so often
blamed for the world’s predicament have simply responded to the
demands of citizens and consumers. No one forces the average
American to use four times as much energy as the average European
every year, or the average European to use five times as much energy as
the average Chinese. No one forces people throughout the industrial
world to run up immense debts and use up irreplaceable natural
resources to produce an unending stream of worthless consumer gew-
gaws. In fact, every political leader in recent years who has tried to
interfere with these habits, or even suggest that they ought to be mod-
erated, has been voted out of office in short order.
Thus there’s a vast hypocrisy in the “SUV environmentalism” that
insists something be done about the ecological crisis, but refuses to
consider giving up any of the short-term benefits of ecological destruc-
tion. Those short-term benefits include much that people in the indus-
trial world consider part of a normal lifestyle. If human exploitation of
the natural world is reined back to a sustainable level, people will have
to make do with fewer goods and services, fewer conveniences, and
fewer choices. There’s no way around that unpalatable fact.
Yet it’s not as though we have a choice. By definition, unsustainable
lifestyles can’t be sustained forever. Like it or not, we face a transition
from a consumer society where most work is done by burning irre-
placeable fossil fuels at an extravagant rate, to a conserver society
where work is done on a far more modest level by sun, wind, water,
and human muscle. The only question is whether we make the change
voluntarily, while there’s still time to save the best achievements of the
last 300 years, or wait until ecological troubles and resource exhaus-
tion force desperate last-minute measures amid rising shortages and
the chaos of a disintegrating industrial system.

THEDRUIDRYHANDBOOK

Efforts to force the change to a conserver society through political
action, which many people see as the best response to the crisis, have
accomplished little, for political change begins with personal change
or it goes nowhere. If people refuse to embrace a conserver lifestyle
in their own lives, is it likely they’ll accept having such a lifestyle
imposed on them by political authorities? Nor will vandalism or vio-
lence bully people into ecological awareness, as a few misguided peo-
ple on the fringe of the environmental movement have argued. Such
outbursts are the political equivalent of tantrums; beyond alienating
people who might otherwise support environmental causes, they
accomplish nothing.
The one option left is the hard, but viable, path of personal action
and example. Each of us causes part of the burden humanity places on
the Earth, and each of us can lighten that burden by our own actions.
The changes seem small in global terms, but one person’s actions can
make a major difference to local ecosystems. The impact adds up as
others do the same, and each person who moves toward balance with
nature blazes a trail that others can follow.
This isn’t simply a theory or a pious hope. The core ingredients of a
conserver society—among them organic farming, permaculture, solar
and wind energy, and recycling technologies—exist today because a
handful of people decades ago decided that the journey back to harmony
with nature was worth making, even if they had to make it alone. Some
people have dismissed the pioneering ecological work of the sixties and
seventies as a failure because it didn’t bring Ecotopia overnight, but initia-
tives launched in those years played out spectacularly in the following
decades. Organic farming, the interest of a handful of activists in 1970, has
grown into an industry that earns billions of dollars and keeps millions of
acres free of toxic chemicals each year. Recycling has followed a similar
growth curve, from the cause of a few ecological radicals to a normal part
of daily life for tens of millions of people.


Such changes have immense potential, for the transition to a con-
server society also has to begin with the personal dimension. Each
person who moves toward a conserver lifestyle takes the world one
step closer to a viable future. If industrial society comes to its senses
and reshapes itself to work within the Earth’s limits, those who already
live in harmony with the Earth can play a central role in helping oth-
ers respond creatively to the task. On the other hand, if industrial
society holds its present course until it crashes into the consequences
of its own arrogant mistakes, those who have made themselves less
dependent on it will be more likely to survive the impact and better
prepared to rebuild a sustainable world afterward. If things fall some-
where between the extremes, as seems most likely, those furthest
along the path to a sustainable future will again be best prepared to
face the perils and possibilities of the transition.
Here again, however, the situation demands awareness as well as
action. Too many would-be environmentalists know little or nothing
about the natural world they think they’re defending. As the environ-
mental crisis grows more severe and options become fewer, an under-
standing of nature combining intuitive insight, factual knowledge, and
personal experience becomes one of the few worthwhile sources of
guidance. Thus the Druid tradition, like other nature-centered spiritual
paths from traditional cultures around the world, has special gifts to
offer during the difficult changes we face in the present and the future.

#### Nature Awareness.

A crucial part of the Earth Path involves waking up to the presence
of living nature in your own life. Many people in the modern industrial
world go through life with their bodies surrounded by a cocoon of

```

technology and their minds flooded with perpetual chatter from the
media. Living and working in climate-controlled buildings, with arti-
ficial lighting to see by, commercial music to hear, synthetic scents to
smell, chemically flavored foods to taste, and a completely manufac-
tured environment to touch, it’s no wonder so many modern people
are deluded into thinking of nature as an unnecessary luxury, and fail
to notice that their glittering artificial world depends, moment by
moment, on vast inputs of materials and energy wrenched from their
places in the cycles of the living Earth.
Psychologists have shown that many kinds of mental illness have a
central factor in common. Despite the stereotype, mentally ill people
don’t lose the ability to think clearly; psychotic delusions are often
masterpieces of internally consistent deductive logic. The trouble
comes because this elegant reasoning loses touch with anything out-
side itself. Deductions become delusions when they stop being tested
against the way the world actually works.
In the modern world, we face the same problem on a global scale.
The artificial environment in which so many people spend all their
time is entirely shaped by human minds, obeying rules unrelated to
the way things work in the natural world. This distorts our thinking
about countless issues. Since plumbing and garbage services take our
waste out of sight, we lose track of the fact that waste never just “goes
away”—it always ends up somewhere. Since money controls the flow
of goods and services within our manufactured world, we lose track
of the fact that all the money in the world won’t let us violate the laws
of nature. It’s not going too far to say that we live inside a delusion
turned real, a hallucinatory fantasy world frozen into material form.
Yet the way out of the hallucination is as close as nature.
The word _nature_ literally means “that which is born.”When the poet
e.e. cummings spoke of the difference between “a world of made” and
“a world of born” in one of his most famous poems, he gave voice to


many of the themes of this chapter. Druidry begins with trust in
nature— recognition that the natural world is our home, our source,
and the teacher of the wisdom we most need to learn. From a Druid
standpoint, everything that comes from nature, everything that’s born
rather than made, provides us with a desperately needed reality check.
That reality check is embedded everywhere in the world around us.
There’s a real value to spending time in unspoiled wilderness places far
from people and their creations, surrounded by living nature on all
sides. Human beings evolved in such settings, and we regain a link with
the Earth and a sense of perspective from renewing our contacts with
nature in this way. Still, the idea that nature exists only in isolation from
humanity is misleading at best, and can turn into yet another excuse for
mindless consumption. Treating nature as raw material for human
recreation or personal retreat is still treating nature as raw material.
Many places around the world are co-creations of humanity and
nature, places in which the made and the born dance together and cre-
ate beauty and healing. Rural areas still unravaged by industrial agri-
culture are full of such places, where fields, pastures, hedgerows,
coppices, and orchards quilt the landscape, and houses of natural
materials nestle close to the land. Wild animals and plants make their
homes in these landscapes, and most traditional cultures guide the
interface between wild and tame in ways that benefit both. It’s possi-
ble to get as close to nature in such a place, and learn as much, as in a
wilderness.
Even in the midst of modern cities, nature is present. Outdoor edu-
cator Tom Brown Jr., in his excellent _Field Guide to the Forgotten
Wilderness_ , describes encounters with scores of wild creatures in
downtown New York City and other urban centers. During two
decades living close to Seattle’s urban core, I spent time watching
urban raccoons, opossums, deer mice, wood rats, and turtles, and lis-
tened to the calls of unseen coyotes in city parks. Birds, from tiny

wrens and fox sparrows up to great blue herons and bald eagles, also
brought nature closer to me in the city. A patch of garden not much
bigger than an average living room graced my life with dozens of wild
herbs (“weeds”) alongside the plants I chose for it, and brought five
different kinds of bees, each with its own habits, to nourish their hives
and my spirit. All these creatures have lessons to teach the Druid.
The door to nature is thus much closer than it looks, and the hallu-
cinatory unreality of modern industrial culture is at least as much a
matter of selective inattention as anything else—the “mind-forg’d
manacles” William Blake described in his poetry. It takes time,
patience, and effort to break through that habit of inattention, but the
results repay the costs many times over.

#### Stillness, Focus, and Study

Three practices make up the nature awareness phase of the Earth Path:
stillness, focus, and study. Stillness requires that you slow down to
nature’s pace. At least once a week, go to a place full of nonhuman liv-
ing things, find a place to sit, and spend at least ten minutes sitting still
and noticing everything around you. Relax your body, and turn your
attention away from the chatter of thoughts and worries that usually
fills your mind. Sit still, watch, listen, and feel.
The first few times you try this, you may find yourself bored or frus-
trated.You may expect something dramatic to happen, and become dis-
appointed when it doesn’t. This happens because your mind is still
running at the frenetic rate of modern industrial society and not at
nature’s slower pace. Simply work at paying attention to the natural
setting around you. Try to broaden your awareness—notice sounds,
scents, wind, light and shadow, changes in the sky and in the distance
around you. Let the world fill your mind and guide it.


Go to the same place sometimes, and to different places at other
times. If you travel to other regions, find places there where you can
become still and pay attention to the world of nature unfolding around
you. Gradually, you’ll find that the practice of stillness teaches you
more than you could learn about Druidry from any other source.
A powerful addition to this practice is the technique of “splatter
vision.” Splatter vision is the technique of letting your field of vision
spread out as wide as possible, instead of focusing tightly on something
in front of you. Let your eyes soften and take in everything within your
field of vision—to left and right, but also above and below. Scientists
have found that the parts of the eye that pick up images toward the
sides of the field of vision have proportions of rods and cones—the
two types of cells that receive visual images—different from the part
that picks up images from straight ahead. Using these rods and cones
thus allows you, literally, to see the world in different ways. “Splatter
vision” takes advantage of this. Experiment with it in your stillness
practice and see where it takes you. The practice of stillness gradually
merges into receptive meditation, one of the types of meditation
taught below in the Moon Path (see p. 229).
Focus, the next phase in nature awareness, involves paying close
attention to what you encounter. You can learn this by focusing your
mind and senses on the details of specific natural things: a stone, the
bark of a tree, a handful of dirt, a pool of water, the crumbling end of
a fallen log. As with the practice of stillness, this requires time. Choose
something and spend at least five minutes as close to it as possible,
with every sense focused on it. Let it be the center of your world for
that period of time. Push aside all other concerns; simply look, listen,
smell, and feel.
Focus practice quickly reveals hidden realms of being. Spend ten
minutes on your belly on the lawn, paying attention to the little lives
that inhabit the microcosmic jungle of grass and lawn weeds, and

you’ll never look at a lawn in quite the same way again. A magnifying
lens is worth bringing on lawn safaris and many other focus expedi-
tions, since sheer minuteness hides entire worlds from ordinary
human sight.
Plan on practicing focus on some natural thing at least once a week
during the year of your Druid initiation. For the first few months,
choose a different target for focus each time. After that, if you wish,
you can revisit one or more of your earlier targets and see whether it’s
changed—or whether you have.
Druidry is a path of knowledge as well as a way of awareness, how-
ever.While ordinary learning won’t take the place of personal encoun-
ters with the living Earth, it has its own importance. Hundreds of
years of careful scholarship and study of the natural world have gone
into creating today’s nature sciences, and these provide important
resources for the Earth Path. Thus study is the third step in expanding
your awareness of nature.
Almost any source of information about nature can be useful. Many
Druids have found, however, that books and resources on the natural
history of their own area are especially helpful, because they bring
study together with experience. Paying attention to nature takes on
new dimensions when you recognize the birds around you, the cloud
types above you, or the varieties of stone and soil beneath your feet.
When you plan on traveling to another area, take the time to learn
something about the living things, geology, and weather there.
It’s also worthwhile to follow your own personal interest, reading
up on whatever aspect of nature seems most intriguing to you. On the
other hand, a certain degree of completeness has its uses as well.
Concepts from Druid philosophy can provide a workable framework
for your studies. _Annwn_ , for example, the primal cauldron of elemen-
tal matter, divides into the three Druid elements calas, gwyar, and
nwyfre. Calas in the elemental realm takes the forms of stone and soil;


gwyar takes the form of water; nwyfre takes the form of air. Books and
resources on geology, geography, oceanography, hydrology, weather,
and similar subjects focused on your local area provide the best
sources for study here.
Likewise, _Abred_ , the circle of incarnate life, can be divided into the
three Druid elements. Calas in this circle is plant life, gwyar is animal
life, and nwyfre is human life. Books on natural history, botany, animal
life, and anthropology focused on your local area, as well as manuals
of plant, bird, fish, and animal identification, form your basic resource
list in this circle.
_Gwynfydd_ , the circle of spiritual life, embraces the philosophical and
spiritual dimension of nature studies. Calas in this circle can be
thought of as nature science—ecology, systems theory, and the envi-
ronmental sciences. Gwyar is nature mythology, especially the tradi-
tional myths and legends of the area in which you live. Nwyfre is the
field of nature spirituality, both traditional nature-centered religions
and recent insights born out of today’s environmental crisis.
How much study you manage during the year of your Druid initia-
tion will depend on the time and resources you have available. One
book on each of the three elements in each circle, or nine books in all,
may be a reasonable target for the average student.

#### Living in Harmony with Nature.

Knowledge and experience form the foundation of the Earth Path, but
constructive action defines much of its course. Since profligate
lifestyles in the developed world are the primary force behind the
destruction of natural ecosystems, there are plenty of opportunities
for action and few excuses for unthinking business-as-usual.

Different Druids lead different lives, and no one way of life can or
should fit everyone. As William Blake wrote: “One law for the lion and
the ox is oppression.”^7 Still, everyone can lighten the burden they
place on nature. Every part of daily life offers chances to go easier on
the Earth, and the consequences of each change add up.
Druids past and present have expressed their commitment to a life
in harmony with nature in many ways. Some abandon a modern
lifestyle entirely and live in rural areas, growing much of their own
food, drawing water and gathering wood, and supporting themselves
through some craft or profession in harmony with the living Earth.
Others live in more ordinary settings, but find ways to make their way
of life as Earth-friendly as possible. Still others find a position some-
where in between, living much of the time in ordinary society in an
ecologically sound way, but creating a place in some rural area as a
sanctuary for wild nature and a space for personal retreats and spiri-
tual work. All of these are valid approaches.
The widely respected Canadian ecologist Dr. David Suzuki has
worked out a list of ten simple ways people in the developed world can
sharply reduce their impact on the Earth, and he challenges people to
adopt at least three of the ten steps. Over eleven-thousand people have
taken up the Nature Challenge so far, including a growing number of
Druids. Below is his list of suggested actions:

```
1. Reduce home energy use by 10 percent
2. Choose an energy-efficient home and appliances
3. Replace dangerous pesticides with alternatives
4. Eat meat-free meals one day a week
5. Buy locally grown and produced food
6. Choose a fuel-efficient vehicle
7. Walk, bike, carpool, or take transit instead of driving
8. Choose a home close to work or school
```

```
9. Support car-free alternatives
10. Learn more and share with others^8
```
Suzuki’s ten steps are well within most people’s reach. Most
Americans can cut more than 10 percent of their home energy use, for
instance, simply by turning off lights when no one’s using them, put-
ting insulation on the hot water heater, and wearing a sweater instead
of turning up the heat on cool nights—not exactly an arduous lifestyle
change. Several other steps require nothing more than keeping the
Earth in mind when making a major purchase; the average SUV burns
nearly twice the gas and produces nearly twice the air pollution that a
station wagon with the same number of seats does, so even soccer
moms can have a positive impact.
A longer list of similar suggestions and challenges would be easy
enough to create. In fact, later in this chapter I’ll do just that. Still, lists
of this sort have their limits. Depending on the circumstances of your
life, some items may not be practical, while other things not on the list
may do at least as much good for the Earth.
This phase of the Earth Path isn’t primarily about following a set of
rules, in other words. Instead, it’s about becoming aware of the ways
your actions affect the natural world and taking action accordingly.
Every day, you make choices that affect the environment. Keep that in
mind as you make your choices and, where possible, choose the option
that does the least damage to the Earth.
To do this, you need to learn to think like an ecologist—or a
Druid.The science of ecology and the Druid tradition both look at the
overall picture, seeing things in context and noticing connections that
narrower viewpoints often miss.The following questions can help you
see these contexts and connections in your own life:

```
THEEARTHPAT H
```

THEDRUIDRYHANDBOOK

**What is it made of?** Everything you use has a source. Products
don’t simply appear on store shelves by magic, and raw materials
don’t appear at the factory gates by magic, either. Every material thing
you bring into your life is made of things that were once part of the
natural world. How they were taken out of nature makes a difference.
_Example_ : Ordinary paper products are made by cutting down living
trees and grinding them into pulp; recycled paper products are made
from paper waste that would otherwise go into landfills. When you
buy recycled products, you save trees and landfill space at the same
time.
**How is it made?** Everything you use was made, grown, mined,
harvested, or gathered by someone, using something. Some methods,
tools, and substances used to produce things damage the environment
more than others, and this makes a difference. _Example_ : Ordinary
industrial farms pour hundreds of gallons of pesticides, weed killers,
fertilizers, and other artificial chemicals onto each acre of farmland.
These end up contaminating soil, groundwater, and the food you eat.
Organic farms use compost, companion planting, beneficial insects,
and other Earth-friendly techniques to grow crops instead. When you
buy organic products, you help keep dangerous chemicals out of the
ecosystem.
**How far did it travel?** Everything you use, unless you make it
from raw materials at home, came from somewhere else. Products
don’t move themselves, and moving them from place to place burns
fuel and creates pollution. How far a product was shipped from the
place it was made or grown to the place it’s used makes a difference.
_Example_ : Food sold at local farmers markets comes from nearby farms.
Food sold at grocery chain stores often comes from hundreds or thou-
sands of miles away.The average item on an American dinner plate has
traveled about 1500 miles—the distance from New York City to
Houston, Texas, or from London, England, to Athens, Greece—


between field and table. When you eat food grown closer to home,
you use less fossil fuel and produce less air pollution.
**What inputs does it require?** Everything you use needs inputs
to make it useful or keep it working. Food needs cooking, clothes need
cleaning, cars need gas, appliances need electricity. What you need to
add to something, and how much you need to add, makes a difference.
_Example_ : Gas-powered lawnmowers burn gasoline and produce air
pollution. Push mowers, powered by the person using them, burn
calories and produce exercise. When you use things powered by sun,
wind, water, or muscle instead of things powered by fossil fuels, the
Earth benefits—and much of the time, so does your health.
**How much waste is involved?** Everything you use involves
some waste, but how much depends on many factors. Many bad habits
of modern marketing and everyday life add to the total waste people
in the industrial world produce, and this makes a difference. _Example_ :
Most modern products come in far more packaging than they need,
and making, processing, shipping, and disposing of the packaging adds
substantially to the total burden placed on the Earth. It’s often possi-
ble to buy products in bulk or in minimal packaging. When you buy
the product without the packaging, you lose nothing and nature reaps
the benefits.
**How long does it last?** Everything you use has a lifespan from
the time you get it to the time you have to replace it. Every time you
have to replace something, the natural world has to deal with the
impact of disposing of the old item and making, processing, and ship-
ping the replacement to you. All of this makes a difference. _Example_ :
Paper towels, paper napkins, and disposable diapers have to be thrown
away and replaced after one use.Towels, napkins, and diapers made of
cloth can be used hundreds or thousands of times. When you use
durable products instead of disposable ones, you take a burden off the
Earth.

```

THEDRUIDRYHANDBOOK

**Where does it go?** Everything you use ends up somewhere;
there’s no such place as “away.” Every material thing you discard
returns to the natural world in some form. How it finds its way back
to nature, and what it does when it gets there, makes a difference.
_Example_ : Food scraps that go into the garbage end up in landfills where
they feed rats and help spread disease, or in waste incinerators where
they’re turned into air pollution. Food scraps that go into a composter
improve soil fertility and help plants grow. When you compost food
scraps instead of throwing them away, you turn a potential pollutant
into a resource.
**How necessary is it?** Not everything offered for sale actually fills
a real need or has a useful purpose. Far too much energy and resources
are wasted producing trinkets that get all their apparent value from
clever marketing. If people stop buying such things, manufacturers
will stop making them, and this makes a difference. _Example_ : Many of
the products that clutter store shelves these days could sit there gath-
ering dust forever without anyone’s life being less complete. When
you only purchase things that fill an actual need or add something
worthwhile to your life, you stop a waste of natural resources and you
free up your own time and money for things that matter more to you.
By asking questions like these and working out the answers, you
begin to see your own life in its ecological context. The insights that
come out of this process of questioning can guide you toward changes
that lighten the burden your lifestyle places on the Earth. Many other
Druids have walked this path before you. The twenty steps below
describe some of the things they’ve done. If you’ve studied the Ogham
material in chapter 5, the arrangement of items in the list may make
additional sense to you.


#### Twenty Steps to a More Natural Life.

1. If you have room for a garden, or can join a P-Patch or allotment
program to garden on public land, grow some of your own food
using organic methods.
2. Buy organic, recycled, and other Earth-friendly products
instead of conventional ones, even when they cost more.
3. Set the heat ten degrees cooler and the air conditioning ten
degrees warmer, replace high-wattage light bulbs with efficient
ones, and make a habit of turning off anything that doesn’t actu-
ally need to be on.
4. Improve your home’s heat efficiency by adding insulation,
installing insulated window coverings, weatherstripping doors,
and putting gaskets behind electrical outlets.
5. Put flow restrictors on your faucets and showerhead to save
water. If possible, replace existing toilets with low-water or
composting models; otherwise, a half-gallon jug full of water in
the toilet tank will limit the amount used in each flush.
6. Never buy anything on impulse. If you think you want some-
thing, wait at least twentyfour hours and see if you still want it
then.
7. Plant trees whenever and wherever you can, and tend and water
them until they can survive on their own (see below).
8. Take a hard look at the electric or gas-powered devices you
own. How many could you replace with low-tech equivalents,
or simply get rid of? Gather up any that can be replaced or dis-
carded and donate them to charity.
9. Contact your local water, electricity, and heating fuel utilities to
find out what conservation programs, rebates, and incentives
they offer, and make use of them.
10. Shop at a local farmers market or join a community-supported
agriculture (CSA) program, in which you buy a season’s worth
of produce in advance from a local farmer, and get a box of fresh
vegetables and fruits once every week or two all through the
growing season.

THEDRUIDRYHANDBOOK

11. Learn how to entertain yourself and your family and friends
instead of letting an energy-wasting machine do it for you.
Television and computer games are no substitute for life!
12. Instead of a grass lawn, landscape with plant species native to
your area. Local conservation groups can tell you which plants
support native butterflies and birds.
13. Whenever you possibly can, walk, bicycle, carpool, or take pub-
lic transit instead of driving a car. Many people who do this find
they don’t actually need to own a car at all.
14. Replace chemical cleansers, laundry detergents, and garden
compounds with natural or biodegradable equivalents.
15. Take care of as much of your everyday health-care needs as you
can using natural methods. Modern medicine is among the most
wasteful and polluting of all industries.
16. Live as close as possible to work or school so that you minimize
the time and energy wasted in commuting.
17. If you’re building a home, include as many Earth-friendly ele-
ments in its design and construction as you can. Earth-sheltered
construction, passive solar space heating, graywater systems,
composting toilets, and other green technologies can make a
home into an ecological oasis.
18. Compost all your yard waste and vegetable kitchen scraps in a
composter or worm bin, and return the compost to the soil.
19. Recycle everything you possibly can. If your area has curbside
recycling, use it. If not, find out what recycling services are
available and use them.
20. Donate old clothes, housewares, and appliances to charity, or
find other uses for them instead of throwing them away.
Many people have reshaped their entire lives using simple methods
like these. The task you face in your year of Druid initiation is a good
deal less demanding. For the second phase of your Earth Path work,
simply make three changes in your life to move it closer to nature and
lighten the burden you place on the Earth. Then follow through on
them consistently for a year.


Three changes and no more may seem overly modest, but there’s
plenty of hard experience behind it. Many people who try to reshape
their entire lives in a single rush fail at it, and fall back into old pat-
terns. Those who take one step at a time go more slowly, but more
surely. After your initiatory year is finished, you can review the
options and your own experiences, and take further steps toward a life
in balance with the Earth.
The relatively modest nature of this phase of the Earth Path is
meant, among other things, to counter the form of self-righteousness
that treats success in some worthwhile task as an excuse to browbeat
other people into doing the same. You’ll notice that all the options
listed above involve changing your own behavior, and perhaps that of
your family or housemates if they agree. None of them require you to
get your neighbors or the rest of the world to change theirs. This is
deliberate, and an important lesson in Druidry.
Becoming a Druid involves taking on the responsibility to bring
your own life into harmony with nature. It doesn’t give you the right
or the duty to tell other people what to do. As Druids, our tradition
calls on us to lead by example, not to point the way with empty words.
Just as Druid rituals enact the cycle of the year as a pattern of balanced
change that human life can follow, Druid ecological action enacts a
healthier way of living with the Earth to show other people that it can
be done, and how it can be done. As Druid spirituality begins in per-
sonal encounters with the symbols and experiences of the tradition,
Druid ecological action begins in personal encounters with the chal-
lenges of leading a natural life in a radically unnatural society.
Be aware that this approach will land you in conflict on occasion.
There are people for whom all environmental action takes the form of
trying to make other people do something. In many cases, this is an
honest response to difficult situations in which the need for change is
desperate and the power of personal action and example seems too
slow. On the other hand, insisting that other people do something

```
THEEARTHPAT H
```

THEDRUIDRYHANDBOOK

about the environment is often a way of ducking personal responsibil-
ity or avoiding the need to make changes in your own life.
Furthermore, supporters of many unrelated causes have become
very skilled at using the language of ecology as bait for the unwary,
insisting that, whatever their crusade, it’s good for the environment.
Even publicists for the nuclear industry have taken to claiming that
nuclear power plants are good for the environment, since nuclear
power doesn’t cause global warming. Since nuclear power produces
radioactive wastes so lethal they have to be kept isolated from the bios-
phere for a quarter of a million years, this is rather like saying that
shooting yourself in the head is good for your health because it keeps
you from dying of heart disease.
Claims this dishonest are rare, but even idealistic movements have
fallen into the habit of making ecological sales pitches based on misin-
formation. Many people in the vegetarian movement, for example,
insist that raising animals for meat is bad for the environment by defi-
nition, and anyone who cares for the Earth should adopt a completely
vegetarian diet. The idealism and concern for the planet that motivate
many vegetarians deserve respect, but their grasp of ecology is less
impressive.This sort of “one size fits all” nonsolution can actually cause
more problems than it solves.Vegetarians are quite correct to point out
that industrial animal raising causes ecological damage, but they appar-
ently haven’t realized that industrial vegetable and grain production
have an even greater impact on ecosystems, destroying soil and dump-
ing large volumes of toxic chemicals into the biosphere.
In fact, mixed organic agriculture that combines animals and plants
into a balanced system benefits local ecologies more than a plant-only
approach, since animal manure plays an important role in cycling
nutrients through to plants and soil organisms. In arid and semiarid
country, furthermore, food plants can’t be raised at all without irriga-
tion, which concentrates salt in the soil, and clearing native vegeta-


tion, which causes massive soil-erosion problems. In such areas, eco-
logically sensitive animal raising that takes the carrying capacity of the
land into account is less damaging to the environment than vegetable
or grain farming.
Does this mean that if you personally prefer a vegetarian diet and
find that your body thrives on it, you should give it up? Of course not.
Like all living things, people have different needs, and it doesn’t help
the Earth or anything else to force everyone to live in exactly the same
way.What it means is that a vegetarian diet isn’t a panacea for the envi-
ronmental crisis. In the same way, you’re likely to meet people who
insist that supporting some political cause, backing some social reform,
or following some religion or spiritual path is an infallible way to save
the Earth, when the actual ecological benefits of that action may be
modest at best. Whenever people insist that their pet crusade is a uni-
versal solution to the ecological problems of modern society, you can be
fairly sure the crusade means more to them than the environment does.
This is true of Druidry as well. The mere fact that you’ve decided
to become a Druid doesn’t do the living Earth any good at all. Druidry
only becomes relevant to today’s ecological crises when it leads to
changes in your life that lighten the burden you place on nature and to
actions that help heal the ecosystems around you. Without that, it’s
nothing but words.
An essential lesson in all the world’s wisdom traditions is that good
intentions are not enough. If you seek to walk the Earth Path as a
Druid, you must take constructive action based on personal knowl-
edge. This is why you’re asked to study books on ecology and natural
history, and why you’re asked to spend time outside, learning the
Earth’s ways firsthand. Finally, it’s another reason why you’re asked to
concentrate on making changes in your own life, so that you experi-
ence their challenges and difficulties as well as their rewards.

#### Planting Trees.

Since early in the Revival, Druids have not only been revering trees,
but planting them as well. It’s no accident that one of the first English
books on tree planting, a 1734 volume on growing oaks by the enthu-
siastic botanist and gardener James Wheeler, was titled _The Modern
Druid_.
It’s hard to imagine any action that does more good for the Earth,
local ecosystems, and the human community than planting a tree. A
mature tree produces as much oxygen as ten people need to breathe,
while soaking up carbon dioxide (the most important greenhouse gas)
and scrubbing many pollutants out of the air. The same tree can pump
hundreds of gallons of water out of the ground on a hot day, releasing
it from its leaves as water vapor, helping to moderate temperatures
and ease drought. Tree roots bind the soil together, fighting soil ero-
sion.Trees anchor local ecosystems, providing food, shelter, and other
resources to animals and birds and improving conditions for other
plants by enriching the soil with their fallen leaves.
Planting a single tree may not seem like much, but each tree
planted and tended through its early years makes a sizeable contri-
bution to the health of the Earth. If you can possibly do so, plant at
least one tree during the year of your Druid initiation. Here’s how
it’s done:
**Get a tree suited to your location.** Local organic nurseries are
a great help here. In the United States, the National Arbor Day
Foundation (100 Arbor Ave., Nebraska City, NE 68410, [http://www.arbor-](http://www.arbor-)
day.org) will happily assist. Other countries have their own tree-plant-
ing programs, which should be consulted if you live outside the
United States. Climate, sunlight, and the amount and quality of the
soil are important factors. So is height; if there are power or telephone
lines above, plant a smaller tree. Check drainage by making a hole ten
inches deep with a shovel and filling it with water. If it takes more than


six hours for the water to drain away, most trees planted in that spot
will drown.
**Make necessary arrangements.** Anywhere that winter tem-
peratures go below freezing, plan on planting in the spring after the
ground thaws, but before trees come into bud, or in the autumn after
leaves have fallen. If you’re far enough south to avoid frost, on the
other hand, you can probably plant any time. The day of the New
Moon is considered a good day for tree planting in many Druid tradi-
tions. In cities and suburbs, contact the utility company several days
before you start digging the planting hole to be sure you don’t hit a
sewer pipe or an electrical conduit.
**Prepare the tree.** Most trees are available as saplings a few feet
tall, with their roots either bare or contained in a “rootball” of dirt. If
the roots are bare, soak them in a pail of water for two or three hours
before planting. If you have a rootball, water it thoroughly.
**Dig the hole.** Make it wide and shallow enough so that the “col-
lar” or “root flare”—the place where the trunk turns into the root-
stock, clearly visible on nearly all trees—is a couple of inches above
ground level. Make it wide enough so that all the roots can be
stretched out to the sides without hitting the edge of the hole. This is
usually three to five times as wide as the rootball. Pile the soil from
the hole to one side. If the soil looks barren, mix a little well-rotted
compost with it. Otherwise, leave it alone; fertilizers, even natural
ones, should never be used when a tree is planted, since they can burn
the young tree’s roots.
**Put the tree in the hole.** Make sure it stands straight—check it
from several directions. If your tree came with bare roots, stretch the
roots gently out to the sides. If it has a rootball, don’t disrupt it; the
larger roots have millions of tiny root hairs that can break off with the
dirt if you do. Once the tree is settled, fill soil around it, covering all
the roots, and pack the soil down gently. Put in more soil than you
think you need, since it will settle once you water it.

THEDRUIDRYHANDBOOK

**Water the tree at once.** Soak it thoroughly so that the soil set-
tles in around the roots and the tree has enough water to carry it
through the shock of being transplanted. Don’t compact the wet soil
by stepping on it, however.
Perform the tree-planting ritual given below to bless the tree and
help it connect to the powers of the cosmos. Like human beings, trees
grow along a vertical axis that connects overworld and underworld.
They mediate the energies of Aud and Aub to create Aur, the lunar
energy of growth and fertility. Just as watering the tree helps the roots
make contact with the soil, blessing the tree helps it make contact with
the subtler realms of being.
**Mulch the area beneath the tree.** In natural woods, a thick
layer of fallen leaves and organic litter blankets the soil and plays a cru-
cial part in soil ecology. You can get the same effect by spreading a
mulch of composted leaves or shredded bark under the tree. Don’t let
the mulch lie up against the trunk itself, since this can foster diseases;
keep it back two or three inches (5–8 cm) from the trunk.
**Water at regular intervals.** A newly planted tree needs five to
fifteen gallons (20–60 liters) of water a week. Unless heavy rainfall
does the job for you, you need to provide this for the first two years
whenever the ground isn’t frozen. Water about three times a week,
soaking the ground thoroughly each time. It’s often useful to build up
a raised ring of soil around the tree, two or three feet out from the
trunk so that water poured onto the ground near the tree pools and
soaks in rather than flows away.
**Keep tending the tree as needed.** If the soil is poor, rake up
the mulch in the fall, put down a layer of good organic compost two
or three inches (5–8 cm) thick, and replace the mulch. Rainwater will
carry the nutrients down to the roots. If the tree is damaged, trim-
ming off broken branches will minimize the risk of disease.Your local
organic nursery can give you pointers on the area’s tree diseases and
pests and point you toward solutions.


A newly planted tree will usually need five years of tending to
ensure its survival. It will need water through the driest part of each
year, treatment for injuries and plant diseases, and new compost at
intervals if the soil isn’t good. After five years, if all goes well, the
roots will go deep enough to find groundwater and reach wide
enough to draw in nutrients from a large area. Once this happens,
your tree stands a good chance of living out its lifespan without fur-
ther assistance.
The following tree-planting ritual is traditional in the Ancient Order
of Druids in America; you may use it or create one of your own:
Plant the tree and water it, leaving a little extra water in the
pitcher or bowl.
Trace the invoking symbol of the three rays of light \ | /over the
upper part of the tree so that the central ray follows the line of the
trunk and say: “May the powers of the natural world come togeth-
er at this point.”
Pour the water down the trunk of the tree and say: “May nwyfre,
the fire of life, and gwyar, the water of life, descend into the phys-
ical form calas.”
Trace the evoking symbol of the three rays / | \ over the lower
part of the tree, with the central ray again following the line of the
trunk. Say: “Within this tree is the fire of growth, Coel. May Ana,
the dark Earth, feed it and water nourish it so that Niwalen may
break forth in leaf and blossom in due time.”
Chant the word _Awen_ , “Ah-oh-en,” drawing each syllable out and
letting your voice resonate. This completes the ceremony.

#### Further Reading.

Among the most important books you can read for your Earth Path
work are field guides and handbooks covering your local geology,
weather, flora, and fauna, as well as the traditions of local native peo-
ples.You’ll need to find these on your own, though local libraries, nat-
ural history museums, and nature societies can usually help. Books that
will help you walk the Earth Path wherever you live include the fol-
lowing:
Tom Brown, Jr., _Tom Brown’s Field Guide to City and Suburban Survival_
(NY: Berkley, 1984); _Tom Brown’s Field Guide to Nature Observation and
Tracking_ (NY: Berkley, 1983); _Tom Brown’s Field Guide to the Forgotten
Wilderness_ (NY: Berkley, 1987). Anyone who can go into the Rocky
Mountain wilderness with nothing but a knife and come out a year
later, healthy and well fed, without harming the land on which he
lived, has something worthwhile to say about nature. Tom Brown Jr.
did exactly that, and went on to become one of America’s most
respected teachers of outdoor skills. These books present not only
techniques but a way of harmony with the Earth that resonates deeply
with Druidry.
Charles Cook, _Awakening to Nature_ (New York: Contemporary,
2001). A thoughtful and inspiring guide to reestablishing contact with
the world of nature by a widely respected outdoors educator, full of
practical exercises as well as wider insights.
Duane Elgin, _Voluntary Simplicity_ (rev. ed. New York: William
Morrow, 1993). The book that launched today’s voluntary simplicity
movement, and still among the best guides to “a way of life that is out-
wardly simple, inwardly rich.”
Eugene Kinkead, _Wildness Is All Around Us: Notes of an Urban
Naturalist_ (New York: Dutton, 1978). Essays and experiences on the
presence of wild nature in the city, well worth reading for urban
Druids.


Aldo Leopold, _A Sand County Almanac_ (New York: Oxford
University Press, 1949) One of the enduring classics of environmen-
tal thought, essential for the modern Druid.
Georgene Lockwood, _The Complete Idiot’s Guide to Simple Living_
(Indianapolis; Alpha Books, 2000). Simple, straightforward, and easy
to use, this is probably the best single introduction to voluntary sim-
plicity on the market.
James Lovelock, _Gaia: The Practical Science of Planetary Medicine_
(Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000). The single best nontechni-
cal introduction to the ecological sciences in print, by a pioneer of
planetary ecological studies. Extremely valuable from the Druid per-
spective.
Jim Nollman, _Spiritual Ecology_ (New York: Bantam, 1990). A guide
to the inner dimensions of today’s ecological crisis, and attitudes and

THE

SUN PATH



# THE SECOND PART OF THE TRIAD

that forms the core of Druid initiation and practice is the

Sun Path, the way of ritual and celebration of the cycle of

the year. The symbolism of the Sun Path reflects an

important aspect of Druid spirituality. Since early in the

Revival, tradition has held that Druid ceremonies should

take place whenever possible “in the face of the Sun, the

eye of light”—that is, out in the open air and the light of

day. Weather and other factors don’t always permit this,

of course, but the habit is worth preserving whenever cir-

cumstances allow. Druid ceremonies draw on the deep

reverence for nature central to the Druid tradition, and

nature is best encountered in person, even when this

means braving a little wind or rain.

```

THEDRUIDRYHANDBOOK

The Sun is a central presence in Druid ritual for another reason, of
course.The holy days of the modern Druid calendar are the stations of
the year, which track the movement of the Sun through the wheel of
the seasons. Some other traditions take their holy days from the date
on which a sacred scripture was revealed to the tradition’s founder.
The book of nature is the sacred scripture of Druidry, and it’s always
being revealed by the turning cycles of time and the changes of the
natural world. The movements of the Sun set the great themes of the
book of nature: birth, life, death, rebirth. The same sense of circling
time that led the ancients to align Stonehenge on the midsummer sun-
rise still inspires Druids today.

#### Learning and Performing Rituals.

Far too much confusion surrounds the subject of ritual. For many
years, one of the great controversies in the Western world focused on
whether ritual should be part of religious life. As is usual with binary
thinking, the opposing sides went to extremes—one claiming that the
exact performance of traditional rites was more important than any-
thing else, the other insisting that ritual was by definition empty for-
malism or devil-worshipping magic. These two viewpoints—one
overvaluing ritual and the other undervaluing it—still powerfully
affect modern views on the subject and make clear thinking about rit-
ual a good deal harder than it has to be.
Ross Nichols, one of the major figures in twentieth-century
Druidry, offered a way around this confusion by proposing that “ritual
is poetry in the world of acts.” In this way of thinking, the performance
of ritual has no special power of its own. Its power comes from the
effects that it, like poetry, has on the people who take part in and


experience it. Just as a well-written poem can reshape the awareness
of its reader or hearer, revealing connections that might otherwise go
unnoticed and highlighting neglected meanings, a well-performed rit-
ual can do the same for those who take part in it.
Thus, celebrating the stations of the year isn’t a mere formality. It
focuses the experience of time and the seasons, lifting participants
out of the limited consciousness of passing days into a wider aware-
ness of the turning wheel of the year. It reminds them that their lives
take place in a larger context, one in which other living beings and
spiritual powers also have a place. It restores meaning to a world in
which meaning often seems in short supply.
The mind also has unrecognized potentials that can be awakened
through the redefining power of ritual. Thus ritual has effects that go
well beyond the realm of psychology, and into subtle realms little
understood by modern ways of approaching the world. For our pur-
poses, it’s enough to recognize that ritual is empty only when it’s mis-
used or ineptly performed. Done with skill and a grasp of basic
principles, it can be full to bursting with meaning and can communi-
cate that fullness to our everyday lives.
Whatever else can be said about it, ritual is a performing art relat-
ed to drama, storytelling, and poetry recitation. What sets it apart
from other performing arts is that the performers are also part of the
audience. For this reason, the regular practice of ritual is the most
important step in walking the Sun Path. By performing and experienc-
ing rituals, novice ritualists learn from personal experience what
works and what doesn’t, and rehearse the skills required until they can
do an effective ritual working at a moment’s notice.
This sort of training yields the best results when the same ritual is
practiced over and over, so that its structure and language become
familiar and the practitioner can start paying closer attention to fine
details and subtle factors. Performing a ritual you haven’t practiced is

```

```

THEDRUIDRYHANDBOOK

like playing a piece of music you’ve never rehearsed: it takes a great
deal of skill to do it well, and that level of skill comes within reach only
when many other pieces have been practiced to the point of mastery.
In the next section, I give an opening and closing ritual for a Druid
grove or ritual meeting designed to be performed and experienced by
one person working alone.This is followed by rituals for the eight holy
days of the modern Druid year, designed to fit between the ritual
opening and the closing of the grove. These specific rituals aren’t
mandatory; you may choose instead to practice rituals from another
Druid tradition, or to create your own.You may also choose to cele-
brate a different set of the Sun’s stations. Although the two equinoxes
and two solstices are fundamental in Druid Revival traditions and
should not be neglected, you may choose not to celebrate the “cross-
quarter days” between them, or decide to replace these with other cel-
ebrations that seem more relevant to your personal Druid path. The
work required for the Sun Path is simply that you celebrate some set
of holy days, including at least the solstices and equinoxes, during the
year of your Druid initiation. If at all possible, take an active role in the
celebrations; simply attending ceremonies as a spectator is a poor sub-
stitute for active engagement in the rituals of the seasons.
The ceremony below is a solitary ritual used to open and close the
grove in the Ancient Order of Druids in America. The seasonal rituals
following it are, on the other hand, original creations based on Druid
Revival sources. In fact, there are no official AODA seasonal rituals.
Indeed, writing and performing an original set of seasonal rituals is
one of the requirements for AODA’s second degree.The holy day rites
given below are simply an example of what can be done with tradi-
tional materials, using methods of ritual and meditation common to
most Druid paths.


#### Opening and Closing the Grove.

The ceremony that follows is the basic framework for all the ritual
work presented in this book, and can be used as a basis for many other
kinds of ritual as well. The first half of the ceremony opens a circle of
sacred space and brings that circle and the person inside it into con-
tact with the powers of the Druid cosmos. When the work of the
grove is done, the second half of the ceremony closes down the chan-
nels of power and brings the circle and the person inside it back into
the world of ordinary experience.
If you choose to use the rituals in this book as the basis for your Sun
Path work, plan on learning, memorizing, and practicing the grove cer-
emony relentlessly. A solid mastery of how to open and close ritual
space and consciousness is essential to making your ritual work an
effective and powerful experience. It’s hard to concentrate on working
with energy and entering the presence of the gods and goddesses if you
have to fumble with a script or struggle to remember what you ought
to be doing. Practice the grove ceremony as often as necessary to com-
mit it to memory. Once a week during the year of your Druid initia-
tion is a good target. If you work with a different set of rituals, of
course, the same level of effort should be applied to them.
For the grove opening and closing ritual, find a space where you
won’t be disturbed. This can be indoors or out—although outdoors is
traditionally preferred, indoors is sometimes more practical in today’s
world.There should be enough room for you to walk in a circle at least
five or six feet across, and preferably twice that. In the center of the
circle, place an altar. This can be a small table or stand with a flat top,
or a convenient stone if you are outside; you can also simply spread an
altar cloth on the ground, since the Earth itself is holy to Druids. For
ordinary purposes, cover your altar with a white cloth, although col-
ored cloths and other forms of decoration are often used in Druid sea-
sonal ceremonies.

THEDRUIDRYHANDBOOK

On the altar, place four small cauldrons or bowls, one on the north-
ern, southern, eastern, and western sides of the altar. Fill the eastern
cauldron half full of sand and place a stick or cone of incense in it. Fill
the southern cauldron half full of sand as well and place a votive can-
dle in it. Fill the western cauldron half full of pure water, preferably
from a natural spring. Finally, fill the northern cauldron half full of salt
or clean earth. These four cauldrons represent the four elements: air
in the east, fire in the south, water in the west, and earth in the north.
The incense, water, and salt or earth also represent the three Druid
elements—nwyfre, gwyar, and calas—and the three rays of light with
the candle as their source. Each of the seasonal rituals has additional
requirements for the altar; you’ll find these listed below.
On the northern edge of the circle, facing the altar, place a chair or
some other object that marks it as a place to sit. If you’re practicing
outdoors, hauling a chair to your circle may be a nuisance; in this case,
a convenient rock or simply a level place on the ground will certainly
do.You will sit down here as the last act of the opening ceremony, and
rise as the first act of the closing ceremony. The north is the position
of honor in the grove, the place where the Chief Druid stands to face
the Sun at its highest point in the sky.The altar is the Maen Log (“Stone
of Speech”) and the high place of light.
The ceremonies that follow call for three other items that can add
much to the experience, but can also be dispensed with if necessary.
The first is a sword with a sheath—preferably a straight double-edged
sword of the sort used by knights in the Middle Ages. This represents
Excalibur, the sword of King Arthur, one of the most evocative of all
Druid symbols. In the opening ceremony, the sword is partly
unsheathed and then returned as part of the formal proclamation of
peace, while in the closing ceremony, the blade is fully drawn. Since
you may not be able to use an actual sword in your ceremonies, I pro-
vide alternatives where necessary.


The second item is a drinking horn with a stand to hold it upright.
This is filled with wine, mead, or apple cider, depending on your pref-
erences and legal status, and represents the Hirlas, or horn of plenty,
which has a central place in the seasonal rituals that follow. If you can’t
arrange for a drinking horn, a chalice or an ordinary glass will do, and
you can substitute water for a stronger beverage in a pinch.
The third item is a white or unbleached robe, the traditional gar-
ment of Druids for the last 300 years. Some Druids wear robes with
hoods, while others wear hoodless robes and nemysses—a simple
cloth headdress of Egyptian style that came into use in the Druid
movement around the beginning of the twentieth century (see figure
7). While wearing a robe is traditional, it’s not required.You can per-
form Druid rituals just as well in some other sort of ritual garment; a
famous picture of the nineteenth-century Welsh Druid Dr. William
Price shows him bare-headed and barefoot, in what looks like long
underwear of scarlet wool embroidered with Greek letters in bright
green silk. Druids earlier in the Revival performed many rituals wear-
ing ordinary clothing, with at most a colored ribbon tied around their
upper arms to show their degree of initiation. Nudist Druids in the
late nineteenth and twentieth centuries routinely performed their cer-
emonies with nothing on their bodies but sunlight and wind.

THEDRUIDRYHANDBOOK

Finally, each of the seasonal ceremonies below has an “offering and
augury of plenty,” a ritual gift traditionally given to all participants
along with a drink from the Hirlas horn.The offering for each celebra-
tion is listed near the beginning of the text in the ceremonies that fol-
low. Depending on the climate where you live, you may need to find
substitutes for one or more of the traditional offerings; it won’t do
much good to go looking for snowdrops or other early spring flowers
at the beginning of February, say, if they don’t come up in your area
for another three weeks. As always in Druidry, pay attention to your
local environment and be willing to improvise.This will get you much
further than a dour insistence on following rules.

```
OPENING THEGROV E
Prepare your ritual space by placing the altar cloth and any deco-
rations on your altar and arranging the four cauldrons. If you have
a sword, keep it sheathed and set it near the chair in the north. If
you have a drinking horn, place it on its stand on the altar and fill
it with whatever beverage you choose.
Light the incense and the lamp, and then go to the edge of the area
where you’ll be performing the ceremony.Take a few moments to
clear your mind of unrelated thoughts and feelings.When you are
ready, enter the circle and walk around it with the Sun—that is,
clockwise—one full circle.Then walk around to the north side of
the altar and face the south.
Raise your right palm forward to salute the Spiritual Sun, which
is always symbolically at high noon in the southern sky, and say:
Let the powers attend as I am about to open a Grove of Druids in this
place.The first duty of Druids assembled in the Sacred Grove is to proclaim
peace to the four quarters of the world, for without peace our work cannot
proceed.
Take the sword from its place, still sheathed, and circle around to
the east. Face outward and raise the sword in its sheath, holding it
horizontally at head level, right hand on hilt, left on sheath.
```

Draw the sword partway from the sheath so that half the blade is
visible, then push the sword back into the sheath. (If there’s no
sword available, raise your right palm outward to salute each
direction instead.) Say: _I proclaim peace in the east._
Lower the sword and proceed to the south, where you repeat the
same process, drawing the sword partway and then sheathing it.
Say: _I proclaim peace in the south._
Proceed to the west, and do the same thing. Say: _I proclaim peace in
the west._
Proceed to the north and do the same thing. Say: _I proclaim peace
in the north._
Return the sword to its place and return to the north side of the
altar, facing south across it. Say: _The four quarters are at peace and
the work of the Grove may proceed. Let this Grove and all within it be
purified with air._
Go to the eastern side of the altar, pick up the cauldron with the
incense, and carry it to the eastern edge of the space.
Walk in a clockwise circle once around the outer edge of the
space, and concentrate on the idea that the incense smoke purifies
and blesses everything in the grove. When you’ve come back
around to the east, return the cauldron to the altar. Say: _Let this
Grove and all within it be purified with fire._
Take the cauldron with the lamp to the southern edge of the space
and go once around clockwise, concentrating on the idea that the
fire purifies and blesses everything in the grove. When you’ve
come back around to the south, return the cauldron to the altar.
Say: _Let this Grove and all within it be purified with water._
Take the cauldron with the water to the western edge of the space
and go once around clockwise, concentrating on the idea that the
water purifies and blesses everything in the grove. When you’ve
come back around to the west, return the cauldron to the altar.
Say: _Let this Grove and all within it be purified with earth._
Take the cauldron with the salt or earth to the northern edge of
the space and go once around clockwise, concentrating on the
idea that the salt or earth purifies and blesses everything in the

grove. When you’ve come back around to the north, return the
cauldron to the altar.
Standing at the north of the altar, say: I invoke the blessing of the
Mighty Ones with the words that have been the bond among all Druids:
```
```
Grant, O holy ones, thy protection;
And in protection, strength;
And in strength, understanding;
And in understanding, knowledge;
And in knowledge, the knowledge of justice;
And in the knowledge of justice, the love of it;
And in that love, the love of all existences;
And in the love of all existences, the love of
Earth our mother and all goodness.^9
```
```
When you’ve finished the prayer, chant the word Awen three
times. Draw the word out into its three syllables—Ah-Oh-En—
and let it resonate throughout your body and the grove.
Go to the chair in the north and take your seat.This act completes
the opening ceremony.
```
```
CLOSING THEGROV E
When the work of the grove is completed, sit down in the chair
in the north and let your mind return to stillness.
When you’re ready, rise and go to the north side of the altar, fac-
ing south across it. Say: Let the powers attend as I am about to close a
Grove of Druids in this place. Peace prevails in the four quarters and
throughout the Grove. Let any power remaining from this working be
returned to the Earth for its blessing.
This is a crucial step, and takes practice. Any ritual working leaves
some energy behind it, and this can usually be sensed as a mood,
a feeling, or a subtle sense of presence in the space. Imagine this
flowing inward toward the altar, down through it to the Earth,
and then down to the Earth’s center.
```

```
Keep concentrating on this until the ritual space feels clear of any
leftover energy. Then say: I now invoke the Sword of Swords.
Draw the sword and hold it high, the blade pointing toward the
sky. Say:
From the rising sun, three rays of light;
From the living earth, three stones of witness;
From the eye and mind and hand of wisdom,
Three rowan staves of all knowledge.
From the fire of the sun, the forge;
From the bones of the earth, the steel;
From the hand of the wise, the shaping;
From these, Excalibur.
By the Sword of Swords, I pledge my faithful service
To the living earth our home and mother.
```
If you don’t have a sword, raise your right hand in salute to the
Spiritual Sun in the south, and make the pledge in this way.)
Sheathe the sword and set it aside. Chant the word _Awen_ three times,
as in the opening ritual.
Raise your right hand in salute to the Spiritual Sun in the south, leave
the altar, and walk in a clockwise circle around the space. Continue
around to the exit and leave the grove. This concludes the closing cer-
emony.

#### Holy Day Rituals.

Celebrating the holy days of the Druid calendar is the most important
use you’ll make of the skills and techniques of ritual performance.
Self-initiation into the Druid tradition, however important its effects
may be, is a process you’ll pass through only once, but the wheel of

the year will carry you from season to season as long as you remain a
Druid. There’s a sense in which the stations of the year are your real
initiation, repeated at ever deeper levels as one year leads to the next.
The rituals given here are designed for the temperate regions of the
Northern Hemisphere. They call on gods and goddesses central to
many British Druid Revival traditions. If you live in the Southern
Hemisphere or in a place with significantly different seasons, or if you
prefer to invoke different spiritual powers, you can modify the texts
below accordingly. This is entirely appropriate; it makes no sense to
perform a midsummer ritual at the Southern Hemisphere’s midwin-
ter just because a book tells you to do it in June. Likewise, it makes no
sense to attune yourself with some other place’s seasonal rhythms
rather than your own, or to call on gods you don’t know and neglect
the ones you do. The following rituals can therefore be used as is or
modified to fit your local ecology and personal theology. The dates can
also be varied, within reason, to fit the demands of your schedule.
Many Druid groves, for example, perform their rituals on the Saturday
or Sunday closest to the actual date of the holy day in question.
The rituals require some familiarity with the basic skills of medita-
tion, including color breathing and discursive meditation. If you plan
to use these ceremonies during the year of your Druid initiation, take
the time to familiarize yourself with these skills before your first holy
day ritual (see chapter 9).
Each ritual has an “offering and augury of plenty” that is presented
to the gods in the course of the ceremony. One part of this is the
Hirlas, the horn of plenty, which contains wine, mead, or cider. The
other part varies with the seasons. Edible offerings, such as bread and
fruit, should be eaten with reverence after the ceremony.The inedible
offerings should be put in a special place, such as a personal altar.They
can be kept until the next holy day and then returned to the Earth in
some suitable way.


**SAMHUINN**

Celebrated on or near 1 November, Samhuinn was the beginning of
the traditional Celtic year, yet its name—spelled Samhain in modern
Irish—means “summer’s end.” This mirrors the central Druid tradi-
tion that every end is a beginning and every beginning an end, in a cir-
cle of completion and renewal. In this spirit, the festival of Samhuinn
honored the dead in old times, and still plays that role in traditional
Christianity (as All Saints’ Day and All Souls’ Day). This is also true in
many other cultures. Tradition holds that the veil between the worlds
of the living and the dead is thin at this time. Since death, in Druid
teaching, is a transformation rather than an end, the evergreen, the
emblem of enduring life, is the chief symbol of this season of the year.

**Ceremony:**

Before beginning the ritual, place a sprig of evergreen on the altar
along with the Hirlas horn. The altar may be draped with fall colors
such as harvest gold, russet, and brown, or decorated with fall leaves;
use your imagination and your creative abilities. Once all is ready,
open the grove with the ceremony given above, take your seat in the
north, and enter into meditation with a cleansing breath. Use violet
color breathing to prepare for the meditation.
The theme for meditation, which should be read aloud in a quiet
voice, is as follows:

```
This day of Samhuinn in the Druid tradition marks the ending of
one year and the beginning of another. In this season, the last of
the harvest is brought from the fields. The Sun, our father,
descends into darkness, and the Earth, our mother, dons her
brown garments of mourning. The veil between the worlds
becomes thin, and the ancestors come close to us. Their voices
whisper in the autumn winds. As we stand among the falling
leaves and the gray and golden light, let us remember the past
and its lessons, and gather a harvest of wisdom to bear us
through winter to the new spring to come.
```
```
THESUNPAT H
```

THEDRUIDRYHANDBOOK

Meditate on this for a time, then finish the meditation and rise to your
feet, facing the altar. Say aloud:

```
On this day I invoke Ceridwen the goddess of wisdom, keeper
of the cauldron of transformation, mistress of the cycles of
change. Ceridwen. Ceridwen. Ceridwen. Join with me in the
circle of the Grove. Grant me your blessings, and receive my
blessing in return. Watch over me and over the living world;
protect, cherish and guide all existences in the turning of the
year’s wheel now before me.
```
Concentrate on the presence of the goddess.When you can feel her in
the grove, go to the altar and take up the Hirlas horn and the ever-
green sprig. Say:

```
In the presence of the goddess, I bear the offering and augury of
plenty. From the green realms of the Earth Mother, the spirits of
nature gather gifts for our sustenance, each in its own place in
the wheel of the turning year. On this day of Samhain, behold
the horn of plenty, emblem of the abundant gifts of nature, and
the sprig of evergreen, in recollection of the year that is past and
hope for the year now to come. In these symbolic gifts, may
there be blessing on the Earth forever.
```
Raise the horn up high, lower it again, and drink from it. Then place
the horn on the altar and say:

```
From the Earth, her never failing promise; from the Holy
Kindreds, their gifts of will and grace. I receive with thanks the
evergreen of enduring life. From all that is given, I give in turn.
```
Lay the sprig upon the altar in offering, return to the chair and resume
your seat. Say:

Those who have established the turnings of the silent stars, who
place the seal of their blessing on the living Earth and lift up its
children to inscrutable heights, have given to all without tribute
and without price. May I be worthy of that which is given.
Pause and say:
With thanks, I have received the blessing of Ceridwen.
Sense the departure of the goddess. Then close the grove with the
ceremony given above.


**ALBANARTHUAN**

Alban Arthuan, or Alban Arthan in modern Welsh, is the first of the
four Alban Gates or solar festivals in the year. It is celebrated on or
around 21 December, the time of the winter solstice. The name tradi-
tionally means “The Light of Arthur.” The solstice, the day when the
Sun finishes its long retreat into the southern sky and begins to move
northward once again, was seen as the birthday of the new Sun, or of
the hero who symbolized the Sun in many old mythologies. Many
modern Druids transfer much of the symbolism of the Christian fes-
tival of Christmas to this holy day. Mistletoe is this day’s special
emblem. Alban Arthuan is a time for firelight, feasting, and rejoicing
as the new Sun returns with the promise of summer to come.

**Ceremony:**

Before you begin, place a sprig of mistletoe on the altar along with
the Hirlas horn.The altar may be decorated in green and white. Open
the grove with the usual ceremony, take your seat in the north, and
enter into meditation with a cleansing breath. The color breathing
should be white.
The theme for meditation, which should be read aloud in a quiet
voice, is as follows:

```
This turning of the year wheel marks the shortest day and great-
est night, the lower hinge of the year, when the Sun completes
his descent into darkness and begins his return. The Mabon is
born in darkness, small and still; the star is lit in the heart of the
rose, the new fire returns in the place of light, the first ray of
the reborn Sun descends into the Earth’s womb in the great
mound of Aengus. It was on this day, likewise, that Arthur began
and fulfilled the circle of his destiny across the twelve sieges of
the turning table of the stars, and on this day shall he begin it
anew in time to come. It is for this reason that this day is called
Alban Arthuan, the Light of Arthur. From the point of light in
the midst of darkness unfolds the creation of all things, the revo-
lution of all that is past toward a new good.
```
```

THEDRUIDRYHANDBOOK

Meditate on this for a time, then finish the meditation and rise to
your feet, facing the altar. Say aloud:

On this day, I invoke Hu Gadarn, Hu the Mighty, the infinitely
great and infinitely small, master of the shining stars and the
great deep, high god of the Druid mysteries. Hu. Hu. Hu. Join
with me in the circle of the Grove. Grant me your blessings, and
receive my blessing in return. Watch over me and over the living
world; protect, cherish, and guide all existences in the turning
of the year’s wheel now before me.
Concentrate on the presence of the god. When you can feel him in
the grove, go to the altar and take up the Hirlas horn and the mistle-
toe sprig. Say:

In the presence of the god, I bear the offering and augury of
plenty. From the green realms of the Earth Mother, the spirits of
nature gather gifts for our sustenance, each in its own place in
the wheel of the turning year. On this day of Alban Arthuan,
behold the horn of plenty, emblem of the abundant gifts of
nature, and the mistletoe, symbol of the presence of divinity in
all things. In these symbolic gifts, may there be blessing on the
Earth forever.
Raise the horn up high, lower it again, and drink from it.Then place
the horn on the altar and say:

From the Earth, her never failing promise; from the Holy
Kindreds, their gifts of will and grace. I receive with thanks the
mistletoe that represents the ever-renewed blessing of the gods
and goddesses. From all that is given I give in turn.
Lay the sprig on the altar as an offering, return to the chair, and
resume your seat. Say:

```
Those who have established the turnings of the silent stars,
who place the seal of their blessing on the living Earth and lift
up its children to inscrutable heights, have given to all without
tribute and without price. May I be worthy of that which is
given.
Pause and say:
With thanks, I have received the blessing of Hu.
```

Sense the departure of the god.Then close the grove with the usual
ceremony.

**IMBOLC**

This festival comes on or around 2 February. Its name—also spelled
Oimelc in some sources—literally means “ewe’s milk,” since it comes
at the beginning of the lambing season, one of the first signs of return-
ing life in the cold, gray days of winter. It is also the time of the first
flowers in much of the temperate world, and early flowers such as the
snowdrop are its chief symbol. In many Druid traditions, this is a god-
dess-centered ritual of light and water, a time of purification and
renewal focused on the stirrings of life in the womb of the Earth.

**Ceremony:**

Before you begin, place a snowdrop or other early spring flower on
the altar along with the Hirlas horn. The altar may be decorated in
blue and silver. Once all is ready, open the grove with the usual cere-
mony, take your seat in the north, and enter into meditation with a
cleansing breath. The color breathing should be indigo.
The theme for meditation, which should be read aloud in a quiet
voice, is as follows:

```
We have come to the time of the year’s quickening, the first stir-
rings of spring in the womb of the Earth Mother. Fire is now
manifested as light, the rising light of spring emerging from the
creative waters, the horizontal plane of space bisected by the
vertical rays of time. Now is the time of the first plow, the birth
of lambs in the pastures, the washing of the face of the Earth,
and the blessing of candles. The torches burn as the young god-
dess returns to the waxing day; the snowdrops bloom amid the

**ALBANEILER**

The second of the Alban Gates, Alban Eiler is celebrated on or around
21 March, at the time of the spring equinox. The name Alban Eilir in
modern Welsh is interpreted as “Light of the Earth” in Druid tradi-
tion. This is the season when the energies of fertility are at their
height. Alchemists once went out at first light during the time from
Alban Eiler to Belteinne to gather dew from the wet grass, knowing
that, at this time of year, it was charged with powerful energies of
renewal and life.

**Ceremony:**

Before you begin, put a vase of spring flowers and a bowl containing
some flower or vegetable seeds on the altar along with the Hirlas
horn.The altar may be decorated in shades of green. Once all is ready,
open the grove with the usual ceremony, take your seat in the north,
and enter into meditation with a cleansing breath.The color breathing
should be red.
The theme for meditation, which should be read aloud in a quiet
voice, is as follows:

In the turning wheel of the year, now is the moment of equal
day and night, the time when the promise of Earth moves
toward its summer fulfillment. This is the time of Alban Eiler,
the Light of the Earth. The birds return from southern lands
bearing springtime beneath their wings. The flowers burgeon
with the promise of fruit. The green blades of the grainfields
leap toward the Sun. From all that is given us, we build again
the temple and song of the Alban Gate.
Meditate on this for a time, then finish the meditation and rise to
your feet, facing the altar. Say aloud:

```
On this day, I invoke Coel, mighty and hidden spirit of life, mas-
ter of the fires of spring and the leap of stag and salmon, power
of vitality surging through the Earth’s veins. Coel. Coel. Coel.

Concentrate on the presence of the god. When you can feel him in
the grove, go to the altar and take up the Hirlas horn, the flowers, and
the seeds. Say:

In the presence of the goddess, I bear the offering and augury of
plenty. From the green realms of the Earth Mother, the spirits of
nature gather gifts for our sustenance, each in its own place in

the horn of plenty, emblem of the abundant gifts of nature;
spring flowers, the blessing of life and beauty that dances now
upon the land, and seeds for the gardens of Earth, in earnest of
greater blessings to come. In these symbolic gifts, may there be
blessing on the Earth forever.
Raise the horn up high, lower it again, and drink from it.Then place
the horn on the altar and say:

From the Earth, her never failing promise; from the Holy
Kindreds, their gifts of will and grace. I receive with thanks the
flowers of beauty and the seeds of new life. From all that is

place the seal of their blessing on the living Earth and lift up its
children to inscrutable heights, have given to all without tribute
and without price. May I be worthy of that which is given.
Pause and say:
With thanks, I have received the blessing of Coel.
Sense the departure of the god.Then close the grove with the usual
ceremony.

**BELTEINNE**

At the opposite pole of the turning year from Samhuinn, on or


around 1 May, is Belteinne, the great Druid feast of life and love, cel-
ebrating the triumph of spring and the renewal of the Earth. This is
symbolically the day when the Sun weds the Earth and impregnates
her, engendering the new life that will stir again nine months later at
Imbolc of the next year. Hawthorn is the great emblem of this festi-
val and rejoicing its major theme.

**Ceremony:**

Before you begin, put a sprig of hawthorn on the altar along with the
Hirlas horn. The altar may be decorated in white. Once all is ready,
open the grove with the usual ceremony, take your seat in the north,
and enter into meditation with a cleansing breath.The color breathing
should be orange.
The theme for meditation, which should be read aloud in a quiet
voice, is as follows:

On this day of Belteinne, spring stands before us in her fullness.
It is the season of flowers, and the Earth welcomes the embrace
of the Sun. On this day in ancient time, fire blazed upon the hill,
symbol of the renewal of light, while offerings were made at
well and spring in the valley below. Fire and water, holy hill and
holy well, stand as twin pillars of the gateway, and between
them is the third, in which they become one—the Tree that
spans the worlds from height to depth.
Meditate on this for a time, then finish the meditation and rise to
your feet, facing the altar. Say aloud:

On this day, I invoke Niwalen, the young goddess of the waking
year, laughing among the flowers, guardian of the sacred spring
and the ancient track. Niwalen. Niwalen. Niwalen. Join with me
in the circle of the Grove. Grant me your blessings, and receive

**ALBANHERUIN**

At Alban Heruin, the third of the Alban Gates, the Sun is at his high-
est point in the heavens, but the triumph of light is shadowed by the
recognition that afterward comes the gradual descent into winter’s
darkness. This festival, called Alban Hefin in modern Welsh, is cele-
brated on or about 21 June, the date of the summer solstice. Its name
is traditionally interpreted as “the Light of the Shore,” the point of con-


tact between the Earth (Alban Eiler, the Light of the Earth) and the sea
(Alban Elued, the Light of the Sea). Vervain, the holy healing plant of
the ancient Druids, is a special emblem of this day.

**Ceremony:**

Before you begin, place a sprig of vervain on the altar along with the
Hirlas horn. The altar may be decorated in red and gold. Once all is
ready, open the grove with the usual ceremony, take your seat in the
north, and enter into meditation with a cleansing breath. The color
breathing should be golden yellow.
The theme for meditation, which should be read aloud in a quiet
voice, is as follows:

This day of Alban Heruin is the hinge and center of the year. The
Sun stands at meridian height. At this time, the bond between
heaven and Earth is strongest, and the Sun, the regent of light
and the center of the spinning worlds, makes most urgent his
message at this turning point of the year. The meaning of Alban
Heruin is the Light of the Shore, for the shore is the meeting
place of sea and land, where the two borders tremble together
in a circle around the Earth. Thus we celebrate the glory of high
summer, remembering the winter past and the winter to come.
Meditate on this for a time, then finish the meditation and rise to
your feet, facing the altar. Say aloud:

On this day, I invoke Beli, the strong god of the Sun’s zenith,
lord of the threefold fire. Beli. Beli. Beli. Join with me in the
circle of the Grove. Grant me your blessings, and receive my
blessing in return. Watch over me and over the living world;
protect, cherish, and guide all existences in the turning of the
year’s wheel now before me.
Concentrate on the presence of the god. When you can feel him in
the grove, go to the altar and take up the Hirlas and the vervain sprig.

behold the horn of plenty, emblem of the abundant gifts of
nature, and vervain, the healing herb of the ancient Druids and
the token of sight and insight. In these symbolic gifts, may there
be blessing on the Earth forever.
Raise the horn up high, lower it again, and drink from it.Then place
the horn on the altar and say:

From the Earth, her never failing promise; from the Holy
Kindreds, their gifts of will and grace. I receive with thanks the
blessing of vervain, the emblem of healing and of vision. From
all that is given I give in turn.

and without price. May I be worthy of that which is given.
Pause and say:
With thanks, I have received the blessing of Beli.
Sense the departure of the god.Then close the grove with the usual
ceremony.

**LUGHNASADH**

At the beginning of the harvest, on or around 1 August, Lughnasadh
marks the first of the three festivals of the declining light. Its name
means “festival of Lugh.” Irish myths relate it to Lugh, the Sun god,
who established it in honor of his foster-mother Tailtiu, the goddess of
agriculture. Bread made from newly harvested grain is a central sym-
bol of this holy day, and many modern Druids celebrate this—and
indeed all three of the autumn ceremonies—with a feast following the
ceremony.


**Ceremony:**

Before you begin, place a piece of freshly baked bread on the altar
along with the Hirlas horn. Any kind of bread you prefer and enjoy
baking can be used; barley bread is traditional in certain Druid orders,
while some Druids in North America consider corn (maize) bread
best suited to their harvest celebrations.The altar may be decorated in
green and gold. Once all is ready, open the grove with the usual cere-
mony, take your seat in the north, and enter into meditation with a
cleansing breath. The color breathing should be green.
The theme for meditation, which should be read aloud in a quiet
voice, is as follows:

This day of Lughnasadh marks the beginning of the Sun’s decline
from the high places of heaven, and the beginning of the harvest
upon the breast of the Earth. The year wheel from this season
rolls downward into the deep places of winter and the rekin-
dling of new light. The Sun descends in the sky, into autumn,
but with glory. The wheel is always balanced, and what seems to
be lost or declining is regained elsewhere or at another time, for
rebirth is the perpetual law of nature. Thus we gather the fruits
of the marriage of Sun and Earth.
Meditate on this for a time, then finish the meditation and rise to
your feet, facing the altar. Say aloud:

On this day, I invoke Sul, the healing goddess of the bright Sun
and the blessed spring, mistress of the fire above and the fire
below. Sul. Sul. Sul. Join with me in the circle of the Grove.
Grant me your blessings, and receive my blessing in return.
Watch over me and over the living world; protect, cherish, and
guide all existences in the turning of the year’s wheel now
before me.
Concentrate on the presence of the goddess.When you can feel her
in the grove, go to the altar and take up the Hirlas and the bread. Say:

Raise the horn up high, lower it again, and drink from it. Then place
the horn on the altar and say:

```
From the Earth, her never failing promise; from the Holy
Kindreds, their gifts of will and grace. I receive with thanks the
bread of the new harvest. From all that is given, I give in turn.
```
Lay the bread upon the altar in offering, return to the chair in the
west, and resume your seat. Say:

```
Those who have established the turnings of the silent stars, who
place the seal of their blessing on the living Earth and lift up its
children to inscrutable heights, have given to all without tribute
and without price. May I be worthy of that which is given.
```
Pause and say:

```
With thanks, I have received the blessing of Sul.
```
Sense the departure of the goddess. Then close the Grove with the
usual ceremony.

**ALBANELUED**

On or around the day of the fall equinox, 23 September, Alban Elued
marks the midpoint of the Sun’s decline and the heart of the harvest
season. Its name, Alban Elfed in modern Welsh, is interpreted in Druid
tradition as “the Light of the Sea,” representing the descent of the Sun
into the western seas toward the close of the day and the year. As the
fourth of the Alban Gates, it marks the outflowing of the energy that
poured into the Earth with the spring. Its chief emblem is fruit,
heralding the fruits of the Earth that attain ripeness around this time.

**Ceremony:**

Before you begin, set a piece of fruit on the altar along with the Hirlas


horn. The altar may be decorated in green and blue. Once all is ready,
open the grove with the usual ceremony, take your seat in the north,
and enter into meditation with a cleansing breath.The color breathing
should be sky blue.
The theme for meditation, which should be read aloud in a quiet
voice, is as follows:

With the coming of Alban Elued, the Light of the Sea, the wheel
of the turning year rolls toward its end and beginning. It is the
time of recollection and return. Now the leaves turn from green
to gold and descend with the waning Sun into the depths of the
Earth Mother. Now the sea becomes dark as the year descends
into ocean. In silence, the seed of wisdom is gathered up, to be
stored through the winter that it may become new life in the
spring. From all that is given us, we build again the temple and
song of the Alban Gate.
Meditate on this for a time, then finish the meditation and rise to
your feet, facing the altar. Say aloud:

```
On this day, I invoke Esus, chief of all tree-spirits, who sits in
the first fork of the sacred oak. Esus. Esus. Esus. Join with me in
the circle of the Grove. Grant me your blessings, and receive my
blessing in return. Watch over me and over the living world;
protect, cherish, and guide all existences in the turning of the
year’s wheel now before me.
```
Concentrate on the presence of the god.When you can feel him in the
grove, go to the altar and lift up the Hirlas horn and the fruit. Say:

In the presence of the god, I bear the offering and augury of
plenty. From the green realms of the Earth Mother, the spirits of
nature gather gifts for our sustenance, each in its own place in

behold the horn of plenty, emblem of the abundant gifts of
nature, and fruit ripe from the summer’s warmth and the cool-
ing nights of autumn, the richness of the harvest and the gifts of
the Earth Mother. In these symbolic gifts, may there be blessing
on the Earth forever.

THE MOON

# THE THIRD PART OF THE TRIAD

that forms the core of Druid initiation and practice is the

Moon Path, the way of meditation.The Moon reflects the

light of the Sun, illuminating the night sky of Earth. Less

obviously, it also reflects the blue radiance of the Earth,

casting back a pale glow that can be seen on a clear night

when the Moon is a thin crescent.

In much the same way, the human mind reflects the

brightly colored world around us, and it also more subtly

reflects hidden worlds within us. Just as the Moon medi-

ates light between Sun and Earth, the mind mediates

awareness between matter and spirit. In fact, the words

“moon” and “mind” come from the same ancient word for

“measure.”

```
THEMOONPAT H
```

THEDRUIDRYHANDBOOK

In many ways, the Moon Path of meditation is the heart and soul of
the Druid way. Without it, the Earth and Sun Paths can turn into out-
ward formalities lacking any spiritual dimension. The gifts brought by
meditation give these paths their inner life, making both of them vehi-
cles for the opening of a wider awareness of the universe and the self.
Some people involved in the more political end of the environmen-
tal movement have assailed inner development as an evasion of
responsibility, an “awareness trap” that draws energy away from the
world of outward action. While this sort of claim is understandable,
it’s also shortsighted. In his powerful study of the crisis of modern
industrial culture, _Where the Wasteland Ends_ , Theodore Roszak points
out that the damage we have done to the living Earth is a reflection of
the damage we have done to ourselves:

```
What, after all, is the ecological crisis that now captures so
much belated attention but the inevitable extroversion of a
blighted psyche? Like inside, like outside. In the eleventh hour,
the very physical environment suddenly looms up before us as
the outward mirror of our inner condition, for many the first
discernible symptom of advanced disease within.^10
```
Thus the quest to restore a sane relationship between human society
and the natural world demands more from us than outward changes in
our lives. It requires new awareness and knowledge. In Druidry, these
are sought and found through meditation. In the same way, the Moon
Path both reflects and enhances the heightened awareness of natural
cycles and spiritual powers that comes through the Sun Path, the rit-
ual celebration of the turning year.
Nobody knows what practices the ancient Druids taught to their
students, but it’s a good bet that some form of meditation was among
them. Nearly all the world’s spiritual traditions give meditation a cen-
tral place among methods of inner development. Certainly, the Druid
Revival took up meditation as a central practice early on. History had
a large part in this, for the art of meditation was going through a major


rebirth of its own in England when the Druid Revival emerged. All
through the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the Church of
England made meditation an important part of its teachings. A whole
literature of meditation handbooks, mostly forgotten now, gave
Anglican clergy and churchgoers alike the tools to add an inner
dimension to the formal side of their religion. The connections
between early Druidry and the Anglican Church gave Druids ready
access to all this material.
Later on, as Druidry moved away from its origins and pursued its
own destiny, new sources of meditation techniques came into the tra-
dition. Many nineteenth-century Druids avidly read English transla-
tions of Hindu mystical and spiritual texts. Later, the overlap between
Druidry and groups such as the Theosophical Society and the
Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn brought more methods of med-
itation into Druid tradition. By the dawn of the twenty-first century,
meditation had been central to the Druid tradition for well over 200
years.
There are many ways to meditate, and each has its own strengths
and weaknesses. The way given here is no exception. It has two chief
strengths. First, it doesn’t need personal teaching or supervision; it
can be learned effectively and practiced safely out of a book. Second,
it doesn’t require major lifestyle changes or inborn talent; anyone in
any walk of life willing to set aside fifteen minutes a day can practice
it and get results. Its drawbacks, in turn, are the other side of its
strengths: because it’s a gentle, low-intensity approach to meditation,
it takes time, and its effects unfold gradually and subtly. Certain inten-
sive methods of meditation produce spectacular results in short order,
but they involve equally spectacular risks to mental and physical
health. Don’t expect either of those here.
If you’ve practiced Asian systems of meditation, one feature of
Druid meditation may surprise you. Many Eastern methods treat ordi-

nary thinking as an obstacle to be overcome. “The mind is the slayer of
the Real; slay thou the slayer,” is a maxim sometimes repeated in these
circles. From a Druid perspective, this approach has problems.
Methods based on stopping the mind work, but they too often pro-
duce people who are spiritually enlightened but intellectually inept.
This has practical drawbacks, and it also makes a poor fit with
Druidry, which respects knowledge as well as spiritual insight. The
Druid way of meditation, like most other Western meditative systems,
takes a different approach. It trains and directs thought instead of
silencing it.
The core process of meditation, no matter what system you’re dis-
cussing, is focused attention. The Druid meditator focuses attention
on thinking itself, directing thought steadily onto a chosen subject.
The mind thus unfolds its inner potential, as in any other kind of med-
itation, and the meditator also comes to understand more about the
subject of the meditation.
This form of meditation is called discursive meditation, because it
often takes the form of an inner discourse or dialogue. It can be
defined as the continued movement of thought toward a chosen
theme. To practice it, arrange an appropriate place, time, and physical
state, and take a posture that aids meditation. Relax into that posture
and use patterns of breathing to help bring your physical body and
nwyfre into quiet balance. A short period of concentration stills the
ordinary chatter of thought, and then your mind turns to the subject
of meditation. Keep your thoughts focused on the subject, or bring
them back if they wander away. As you call to mind each aspect of the
subject and follow out its implications, you learn to shape the flow of
thought, while unfolding hidden dimensions of the subject itself.
This process requires some learning, of course. Most novice medi-
tators find it easiest to start with practical details such as place, time,
and posture, and proceed inward from there, through a series of exer-


cises in which each step includes all the previous steps. We’ll begin
with preliminaries on the physical level.

#### Preliminaries to Meditation.

You’ll need a private place for practice with no loud noise sources
nearby, and with a clock you can see easily. The place doesn’t have to
be particularly fancy or Druidical. A room with a door you can close
is all that’s required. If you can’t manage this, a corner of a room and
a little forbearance on the part of your housemates will do the job.
Many Druids like to meditate outdoors, and this can work well if your
local climate and human noises don’t interfere. Meditating a few yards
from a waterfall is one thing; meditating a few yards from a dirt road
used by motorcycles is quite another.
In the early stages of your training, it’s a good idea always to med-
itate in the same place. The mind is a creature of habit, and if you
always go to the same place when you meditate, it will be ready to
enter a meditative state whenever you do so.
Clothing for meditation should be comfortable and loose, especially
around the waist and chest. Tight belts and tight bras are particularly
unhelpful. Avoid anything that restricts breathing or puts pressure on
your body. Many Druids find that a robe works well for meditation; if
you use a robe for ritual, you can certainly wear it for meditation as
well.
Time is also a factor. Making time for daily meditation is the most
important step you’ll take on the Moon Path. It’s also the step that
beginners resist most stubbornly, even though it usually takes nothing
more than setting the alarm clock a little earlier in the morning or
skipping one TV sitcom each evening. Many students start out medi-

tating once or twice a week. This is fine to begin with, as long as you
stick to it. Don’t let your meditation slide into the heap of things you
want to get back to someday. Occasional meditation is better than
none, but the benefits of meditation only come with regular practice.
Most students find it best to meditate at the same time every day,
to make the best use of the power of habit.This can be either the same
clock time or, if your schedule swings around the clock, the same
point in your daily activities—for example, in the morning before
breakfast or just before going to bed at night. If you live with other
people, of course, your meditation time will need to be negotiated
with them.
In today’s reality of busy schedules and crowded evenings, it’s often
best to make time for meditation by setting the alarm half an hour
early each morning. Meditating first thing in the morning allows you
to come to your meditation with a mind as uncluttered as possible,
and it makes sure that your meditation won’t be pushed aside if the
time demands of your job or social life spin out of control. It also
makes the most use of meditative themes as sleep subjects, a technique
explained later on.
Your practices and your lifestyle will impact each other, although
much less drastically than some traditions teach.You don’t have to take
up a special diet and retreat to a monastery in order to practice med-
itation. However, food and drink do affect your ability to meditate. It’s
best not to meditate within about an hour after eating a meal; the
heavier the meal, the longer you should wait. Digestion sends most of
the body’s resources to the stomach, while meditation sends most of
them to the brain. Trying to do both at once can produce indigestion
and nausea, as well as muddled meditations.
Some traditions insist that meditators take up a vegetarian diet.
What you eat affects your awareness, and this can be a tool worth
using in certain situations. Still, insisting that any spiritually minded
person must follow a particular diet is both inaccurate and potentially


harmful. It’s inaccurate because the world contains vibrant meditative
traditions that counsel every diet imaginable. Meat, onions, salt, grain
products, and just about every other food you can name are forbidden
by some traditions, mandated by others, and treated as unimportant by
still others. (People who think that eating meat and having powerful
spiritual experiences are mutually exclusive, for instance, should sit
down with a copy of John Neihardt’s book _Black Elk Speaks_ and a _very_
strong cup of chamomile tea.) It’s potentially harmful because people
have different nutritional needs, and a diet that feeds one person per-
fectly can leave another malnourished. However spiritual your inten-
tions may be, if what you’re doing damages your health, you’re doing
something wrong.
The case of sex is similar.You’ll hear claims that meditation should only
be performed by people willing to take and keep a vow of chastity.This is
true of some intense and dangerous methods that redirect sexual ener-
gies into other channels. It’s not even remotely true of the kind of med-
itation taught here. Different people have different responses to sex;
some find it best to wait for an hour or so after intercourse to allow
subtle energies to return to normal, while others find that meditation
works best right after sex. Explore your own responses and time your
meditation practices accordingly.
Drugs are a more straightforward case. A drug is any substance,
legal or not, that causes significant changes in the way your nervous
system works. Here, the rule is simple: Drugs and meditation don’t
mix, and it’s best to avoid meditation when you’re under chemical
influence. Again, that includes legal chemicals as well as illegal ones—
coffee and alcohol as much as marijuana or cocaine.
The problems that arise from mixing drugs and meditation vary
from drug to drug, but the basic principle is the same. Every drug dis-
ables some part of the complicated biochemical balance of your nerv-
ous system; that’s how drugs work. At the very least, this makes
meditation more difficult and less productive, and adding the effects of

```

meditation to a nervous system in disarray is not a good idea. Some old
meditation manuals state, for example, that meditating with alcohol in
your bloodstream causes long-term neurological damage.While I don’t
know of any studies verifying this, it’s not a risk you should take.
The basic rule is that you should avoid meditation until your system
is free of drug effects, including any hangover. This can take twenty-
four to forty-eight hours if you’ve used a lot of alcohol or any of the
harder illegal drugs. There’s much to be said, then, for the traditional
rule that a student of meditation should avoid more potent drugs com-
pletely, and use milder ones such as coffee and wine very moderately.
This may seem restrictive, but every path has its requirements, and
one requirement of the Moon Path is a brain that’s free of chemical
fog. If the habit of using drugs is one you’re not willing to break, or at
least limit sharply, the Moon Path may not be for you.

**POSTURE**

Now that you’ve set aside space and time for meditation, and arranged
other details of your life so they won’t interfere with the practice, it’s
time to get to work.The first level of practice is purely physical: a pos-
ture of meditation that will allow you to remain comfortable, without
moving, during each practice session.
Requirements for a meditation posture are straightforward. Your
position should be stable and comfortable, so that you don’t have to
keep paying attention to your body. It should allow relaxation without
encouraging sleep. It should also keep your spine vertical to foster
deep breathing and to allow nwyfre to flow freely up and down the
spinal channels.
Many people think of _padmasana_ , the “lotus posture” of Hindu and
Buddhist practice, whenever meditation postures come to mind. The
lotus posture isn’t appropriate for this work, however. It’s uncomfort-
able for most Westerners and impossible for many; people have dam-


aged their knees seriously trying to force themselves into it. Cross-
legged postures such as padmasana also close off the flow of nwyfre
between the meditator’s body and the Earth, and this isn’t helpful in
Druid meditation—quite the opposite.
The two traditional positions for Druid meditation are a good deal
easier to achieve. To enter the first and most common, sit down on a
chair, far enough forward so that your back doesn’t touch the back of
the chair at all. The chair should face east when you’re meditating,
whenever that’s possible, to take advantage of currents of nwyfre that
circle the globe from east to west, driven by the play of forces between
Earth and Sun. Facing into these currents while you meditate helps
balance your subtle bodies.
Your posture should keep your thighs parallel to the ground and
your hips and knees at right angles. If the seat of the chair is too low,
put a pillow on it; if the seat is too high, put a book under your feet to
raise your thighs to the proper angle. Your legs may be together or a
short distance apart, as you prefer. Rest your hands palms down on
your thighs, fingers pointing toward your knees. Keep your ankles
directly under your knees, your feet flat on the floor (or the book),
your elbows resting comfortably at your sides, your spine straight
without being stiff, and the crown of your head level, as though you
were balancing something on top of it. Keep your eyes open, looking
ahead and slightly down.
Any posture that keeps the feet flat on the ground, the spine
straight and uncompressed, and the breathing unrestricted can be used
for meditation of the sort taught in this book. Some Druid traditions
use standing postures of various kinds, and if standing meditation
attracts you, fee free to try it. If you like, experiment with various
positions. As you work your way through the beginning stages of the
Moon Path though, it's best to choose one posture and stick with it, to
make use of the power of habit.
The second meditation posture is less widely known. Many of the

THEDRUIDRYHANDBOOK

Anglican meditation manuals used by Druids in the early years of the
Revival gave special instructions for meditating while walking in a gar-
den or some other quiet area. To meditate while walking, choose a
route over level ground where you won’t have to bend, climb stairs,
duck around trees, or do anything else that will interrupt your
thoughts. A paved or gravel path in a garden is ideal. It should lead in a
circle, so that you can keep walking as long as necessary. Walk slowly
and smoothly, taking relatively small steps at a steady rhythm. As with
the seated posture, your spine should be straight without being stiff,
the crown of your head level, and your eyes lowered. Let your arms
move easily and naturally at your sides.
Spend your first practice session or two learning to settle into your
chosen posture. If you’re using the seated posture, sit down, arrange
your body, and stay in the posture without moving for five minutes by
the clock. This may turn out to be much more difficult than you
expect. Even the most balanced posture will start to feel unfamiliar
and awkward after a short time, and if the muscles around your spine
are weak, your back may ache a little from the unfamiliar work of
holding your body upright. You’ll probably want to fidget and shift
around, and you may start thinking about trying meditation in an over-
stuffed easy chair instead.
Not so fast! Fidgeting is to the body what wandering thoughts are
to the mind. Slumping back into an easy chair puts you in a position
where you can’t breathe deeply and won’t benefit from the energy
flows along the midline of your body. Stick with the posture, fight the
urge to fidget, and don’t let yourself wiggle, even when the posture
seems intolerable. Most people find that, after some practice, discom-
fort fades and the posture becomes familiar and comfortable.
The rhythmic movement of the walking posture is often more com-
fortable, at least at first, but you should still spend a session or two
practicing it. Over time, maintaining the slow steady pace needed for


meditation can become quite as awkward as maintaining the motion-
less posture, and you may find yourself suddenly losing your balance
and pitching to one side or the other as your body struggles with the
posture. Keep with it and, in time, your body will find a new rhythm
and move with the meditation, not against it.

**RELAXATION**

One of the things you’ll notice when you try meditation is that your
body is much more tense and uncomfortable than you ever imagined.
Most people carry quite a lot of needless tension in their bodies. This
excess tension is a problem for the meditator, since it distracts the
mind and also gives rise to many physical and mental problems. The
ability to notice and release tension is one of the positive side effects
of meditation.
If you haven’t done systematic relaxation before, set aside time out-
side your meditation sessions for relaxation practice. Start by getting
into loose clothing and lying down on your back on a hard surface.This
usually means the bare floor. A bed is too soft, and so is anything else
padded.The surface should be hard enough to be uncomfortable—it’s
the discomfort that shows you where the tensions are. If the only hard
surface available is bare concrete or stone, spread a thin blanket on it
to keep it from absorbing heat too quickly from your body, since it’s
hard to relax when you’re shivering.
You’re likely to find this fairly unpleasant at first. The places that
hurt are the places where you have plenty of excess tension built up.
Do your best to put up with the discomfort; the first step in learning
to relax is to pay attention to where you aren’t relaxed.
Start by noticing how much of your body is actually touching the
floor. Most people hold themselves up off the floor on a few points—
the back of the head, the shoulder blades and upper back, the but-
tocks, the calves, the heels. If that’s the way you’re lying, imagine how

```
THEMOONPAT H
```

THEDRUIDRYHANDBOOK

much effort it’s taking to support the weight of your body on those
few points. That’s a measure of the amount of energy you’re putting
into being tense.
Spend a few moments trying to sink down onto the floor, to broaden
the areas of contact, so that more of you is resting on the floor. Don’t
try to do this by making an effort with your muscles! Instead, let your
body spread out and sink; breathe slowly and evenly, and imagine ten-
sion leaving your body on each outbreath. Don’t worry if you don’t
see much improvement at first. Like so much in the art of meditation,
this has to be learned one step at a time.
Now turn your attention to your feet and relax them in the same
way, breathing out tension on every outbreath. Go from your feet to
your ankles, and do the same thing. From your ankles, go to your
lower legs, your knees, your thighs, your buttocks, your groin, your
hips, your abdomen (front and back together), your midriff (ditto),
and your ribcage (ditto). Then start again at your hands: relax your
hands, your wrists, your lower arms, your elbows, your upper arms,
your shoulder joints, and the upper part of your torso where your
shoulders join your chest. Then go on to your neck, your jaw, your
face, and your scalp, finishing at the very top of your head.
The first few times you work your way through this process, you
may notice only a small lessening of tension, or you may feel as limp
as a boiled noodle. In either case, stretch, shift, and wiggle to wake up
your muscles before you get up.You’ll find that most of your tensions
will slip right back into place before long, but not quite all of them
will. By practicing this exercise regularly, you’ll find that your body
will gradually learn how to do without all that tension, and you’ll see
positive results in your meditation practice and the rest of your life.
In order to use the same skill in meditation, however, you must
learn to let go of tension when you’re in your meditation posture.This
is a more complex matter, since you can’t simply go limp without


falling off the chair or onto the garden path.Your goal is to find a mid-
dle ground between tension and limpness; “poised” is a good word for
the state you’re trying to reach.
To learn this, once you’ve learned the meditation posture, put a
few meditation sessions into learning how to relax in it. Sit down or
start walking, and then go through the same process of step-by-step
relaxation you did while lying on your back, starting with your feet
and ending with your scalp. Take your time and release as much ten-
sion as you can.
As you do this, you may catch your thoughts drifting away from
relaxation onto other subjects. Pay attention to this, and bring your
attention back to the process of relaxation. Unless you have some
experience with meditation, you’ll probably spend a lot of time
rounding up your thoughts and bringing them back to the job at hand.
Don’t get discouraged if this happens.This is actually a simple form of
meditation. By focusing your awareness on tension and relaxation,
you’re already starting to meditate and building skills that will be cen-
tral to all your Druid work.

**BREATHING**

Once you’ve learned posture and relaxation, the next step is breath-
ing. What posture and relaxation do for your body, proper breathing
does for nwyfre. This is crucial in meditation, since nwyfre, like your
body, needs to be calm and still during meditative practices. An old
metaphor describes it as a pool of water that can only reflect the sur-
rounding trees and the sky when it is still. Stilling the pool of nwyfre
is the task of the art of breathing.
The thought of breathing as an art may seem strange to you, and
there’s a reason for that. Most people in the modern world do a very
poor job of breathing—precisely because we rarely give it any
thought. We simply do it, taking the path of least resistance through

```

THEDRUIDRYHANDBOOK

whatever tensions and bad habits we’ve built up over the course of a
lifetime. Getting out of the rut of habitual poor breathing and learn-
ing how to breathe fully and freely thus takes practice.
When you’ve learned a meditation posture and spent some practice
sessions learning how to relax into it, devote your daily meditation
sessions to breathing. Take up your meditation posture and relax into
the position. It’s not necessary to go through the whole feet-to-head
relaxation drill, but relax your body overall. Spend a little time relax-
ing any areas that feel especially tense before you go on to breathing
exercises.
There are three special breathing patterns used in this system of
meditation.The first, called the cleansing breath, is done at the begin-
ning and end of every meditation practice. Start by drawing in a slow,
deep, full breath through your nose to the bottom of your lungs. As
you breathe in, press out with your diaphragm muscles below your
lungs; allow your belly and lower back to stretch outward, then your
midriff and middle back, then your chest and upper back. At this
point, your lungs should be full of air. Now purse your lips as though
you were blowing through a straw, and breathe out in a series of short
puffs. Keep puffing until your lungs are empty. Leave them empty for
a moment or two, and then breathe in.
The cleansing breath, as the name suggests, cleans stale air and stag-
nant nwyfre from your lungs and body. It should not be overdone.
Once at the beginning of each meditation session and once at the end
is enough.
The second special breathing pattern, which follows the cleansing
breath, is called the rhythmic breath. This is the workhorse of the sys-
tem, so I will describe it in plenty of detail.
Start with your lungs empty, after a cleansing breath. Breathe in,
slowly and smoothly, through your nose. Draw the breath down as far
as possible at first, pressing down and out with your diaphragm mus-
cles below your lungs, so that your belly and lower back expand while


your chest remains motionless. Then expand the middle of your
trunk, the area around your solar plexus, your floating ribs, and your
middle back. Finally, once this is full, expand your chest and upper
back, feeling the outward stretch of your ribs, your breastbone, and
your shoulder blades.
At first, when you’re learning the pattern, take these three phases
one at a time. Later, with practice, they can become a single motion of
the breath, which starts in your lower abdomen and rises up to your
upper chest.Your lungs should be full, but not as full as in the cleans-
ing breath. There should be room in your lungs for more air than you
take in.
At the end of each inbreath, hold your breath for a short time by
maintaining the expansion of the muscles of your trunk, not by clos-
ing your throat. If you hold your breath by closing your throat in
breathing exercises, you risk damaging the sensitive tissues of your
lungs. This point often takes practice, since many people’s breathing
muscles are weak from lack of use, and beginners sometimes draw in
a deep breath only to feel it leaking away through their open throats
while they try to hold on to it. Patience and practice will do the trick.
If you have trouble telling whether your throat is open or closed, keep
drawing a slow, thin current of breath in through your nose while you
hold your breath.
Now breathe out through your nose in the same order you breathed
in, pulling your belly and diaphragm inward and upward while keep-
ing your chest expanded and drawing in your midriff. Then, finally
draw in your chest. Do this slowly and smoothly, but not so slowly that
you end up gasping.
Finally, when your lungs are completely empty, keep them that way
for a short time. Again, do this by controlling the muscles of your
chest and abdomen, not by closing your throat. If your breathing mus-
cles are weak, keep breathing a thin stream of breath out through your

```
THEMOONPAT H
```

THEDRUIDRYHANDBOOK

nose during this phase. Begin again with an inbreath.
The rhythmic breath, as the name suggests, is done to a steady
rhythm.The usual method is to breathe in while silently counting from
one to three, hold the breath in while counting from one to three,
breathe out while counting from one to three, and hold the breath out
while counting from one to three.The counts should be evenly spaced
and as slow as you can make them without puffing and gasping for air.
If you’re practicing walking meditation, the rhythm of your steps and
your breathing should synchronize. With a little practice, you’ll find a
rhythm that works for you.
The third special breathing pattern is called the silent breath. This
is done after the cleansing breath and the rhythmic breath during med-
itation. It’s much simpler than the first two patterns, so you can con-
centrate on something other than breathing. The silent breath is done
by breathing in slowly and smoothly in an ordinary rhythm. On the
inbreath, draw the air down into the bottom of your lungs by gently
pressing your diaphragm muscles down and out. On the outbreath, let
your diaphragm rise up and in. Breathe through your nose slowly and
gently, so that your breath makes no sound.
As your work with the silent breath deepens, you may find it use-
ful to pay attention to the moment between the end of the inbreath
and the beginning of the outbreath, and prolong it without actually
holding your breath. In the Ancient Order of Druids in America,
which borrowed the technique from modern Essene teachings, this
moment is called the “Window of Opportunity” and is used to focus
and recollect the self. Its deeper applications belong to more advanced
levels of training than this book covers, but attention to the Window
and its subtle effects will deepen your meditation and lay the ground-
work for more advanced techniques further along your Druid path.
To practice breathing for meditation, assume your chosen posture
and relax your body. Do the cleansing breath once and then start the


rhythmic breath. Keep breathing with the rhythmic breath for at least
five minutes. Focus your mind on breathing, bringing it back to your
breath whenever it goes wandering off to some other subject. Then,
when you’re ready, shift to the silent breath and remain with it for as
long as you wish, paying attention to the Window of Opportunity if
that seems appropriate. Do one more cleansing breath to finish.

**COLORBREATHING**

The rhythmic breath has another side, which provides one of the more
subtle and flexible tools in the Druid toolkit. In Druidry, breath com-
bines with imagination to work more intensely with nwyfre, in a tech-
nique called color breathing. Once you can do all three forms of
breathing readily without having to look up the instructions, and have
practiced them several times, you can learn color breathing.
Imagine that the space around you is filled with different colors of
light. Like every Druid technique, this can be a challenge for some
people at first, but anyone can learn to do it with a little practice.Take
a moment to try it now, as you are reading. Imagine the space around
you filling with clear green light, the color of sunlight through leaves.
Imagine green all around you, like an ocean of color, reaching out infi-
nitely in all directions. Pay particular attention to the space close to
your body. Make sure the green color is all around you, coming right
up to the boundary of your skin. Then, after you’ve built up the color
as intensely as you can, dissolve it, until no trace of the green color
remains in your awareness.
To practice color breathing, do this with a color and then imagine
that you’re breathing it into your body with each inbreath, and breath-
ing it out with each outbreath, through your solar plexus—the area
just below your breastbone, between the sides of your lower ribcage.
As you breathe in, concentrate on the idea that the color is flowing
into your body and filling it completely. In your mind’s eye, see your

```
THEMOONPAT H
```

THEDRUIDRYHANDBOOK

whole body glowing intensely with the color. Then, as you breathe
out, concentrate on the idea that every trace of the color is flowing out
of you; see your body empty of the color, but the space around you
filled with it.
The traditional explanation for this practice draws on old lore
about the solar plexus. According to occult tradition, this is the place
through which your body draws in aud, the solar current of nwyfre,
from the Sun and the atmosphere. When you concentrate on a specif-
ic color in the air around you, the nwyfre surrounding your body takes
on the energies associated with that color, and when you draw the
charged nwyfre into yourself, the energies affect your mind and body.
There are other, more psychological explanations. No matter how
color breathing works, however, it _does_ work, and can be a useful part
of your meditation.
Your choice of color depends on the effect you want. The follow-
ing colors and their uses are standard in Druid practice, but since
everyone responds a little differently, you’ll want to experiment with
different colors yourself and note their effects.

```
Red is energizing and awakening. Use when drowsiness is a
problem in meditation, when practicing concentration (see
pages 220–222), or when preparing for magical work. A
clear rose red works well for this purpose. Use darker reds
to energize your physical body.
Orange combines the energizing effects of red with the
clarity of yellow. Many people find a clear, pale orange best
for ordinary meditation. Deeper oranges tend to encourage
mental chatter and so should be avoided before meditation.
Yellow clarifies and strengthens your mind. It’s another
common favorite for daily use in meditation; a light, clear
yellow like morning sunlight is best. Deeper yellows, like
deeper oranges, make the mind harder to direct.
Green combines yellow’s clarity with the receptive quali-
```

ties of blue. Green is commonly used before exercises that
bring in nwyfre from the natural world (see page 230). Use
pale spring greens before contacting solar energies and deep
emerald greens for telluric contacts.
**Blue** is passive and receptive, opening the doors of aware-
ness to a wider world. Blue color breathing helps prepare
for divination, visionary work, and trance. The deeper the
shade, the less conscious control of the experience you will
have.
**Violet** combines active red and receptive blue into a color
of pure power, potent but dangerous if mishandled. Violet is
most often used for ritual magic and other intensive work
with nwyfre, although it also has a place in techniques such
as the Druid’s Egg (see page 233).
**White** is like violet, but combines all the colors. Use it in
working with gods and goddesses, and in other forms of
theurgy or spiritual work. It should be clear and bright.
These are only general guidelines; there are many variations. The
colors associated with the Druid elements and the Ogham letters
can also be used in color breathing for particular effects. The eight
stations of the year also have colors that relate, in turn, to energy
centers within the subtle body. Study and practice will open these
particular doors in due time.
When you meditate, do color breathing along with the rhythmic
breath. After you assume your chosen posture, relax your body, and
clear out stagnant nwyfre with the cleansing breath. Then imagine
your chosen color all around you. Bring it in through your solar plexus
as you breathe in, hold it in your body as you hold your breath, empty
the color from your body as you breathe out, and be aware of it sur-
rounding your body as you hold your lungs empty.When you finish the
rhythmic breath, imagine the sea of color around you fading out of
existence.

#### Concentration and Meditation.

The next step in preparation moves from the realm of breath and
nwyfre to the mind itself. Here, one of the main obstacles to medita-
tion shows itself. Meditation requires the sustained movement of
thought toward a chosen topic, but very few people can think about
the same thing steadily for more than a few seconds at a time. The
untrained mind—and nearly all of us have untrained minds—jumps
from thought to thought like an overexcited monkey, never staying in
one place for more than a moment. Thus, after you’ve learned to sit,
to relax, and to breathe, you must learn to concentrate.
This is often the most frustrating part of learning to meditate;
many people give up at this point. Dreams of magical power or spiri-
tual wisdom clash uncomfortably with the realization that you can’t
keep your mind from misbehaving for five seconds in a row. Still, it’s
an obstacle that has to be faced. It helps to cultivate patience and the
knowledge that everyone has to go through this stage.
Make a concentration target before beginning the exercise below.
Find a piece of thin plywood or heavy cardboard six inches square.
Paint it black, or glue a sheet of black paper onto it. In the center of
the square, put a white circle one inch across; again, you can paint this
or glue on a circle of white paper. The result, either way, is a plain
white circle on a plain black background that, among other things,
represents the Full Moon, the emblem of the lunar current in full
manifestation. Place this in front of your meditation chair, below eye
level, in a position where you will be looking directly at it during prac-
tice sessions.
Now you’re ready to begin concentration training—a simple
process, but not an easy one.Begin by assuming the sitting meditation
posture, relax your body, take a cleansing breath to dispell stagnant
nwyfre, and do about five minutes of the rhythmic breath with red


color breathing.Then shift to the silent breath and turn your attention
to the white circle in the center of the concentration target.

```
FIGURE 9. CONCENTRATION TARGET.
```
Your task is to keep your attention on that circle. Look at it, and be
aware of yourself looking at it. Let your whole world contract to a
white circle one inch in diameter. Unless you’re unusually gifted, of
course, this won’t happen.What will happen instead is that you’ll sud-
denly realize that you’re thinking about something or looking some-
where entirely different, and you’ve completely lost track of the
circle.
When this happens, don’t just go back to the circle. Trace your
thoughts back to where they left it. If you found yourself looking at
your left knee, for instance, how did you get there? You were thinking
about a bruise on that knee. Why? Because you got that bruise getting
your cat down from a tree, and you were thinking about the cat. Why
were you thinking about the cat? Because you remembered that you
needed to go to the store to get cat food, and that memory, coming
suddenly to mind, was what distracted you from the circle.
Your monkey-mind may have jumped through many more thoughts
than this between the circle and wherever you caught up to it.
Whatever the route, try to trace it all the way back to the point when
your mind was distracted from the circle, and then resume focusing on
the circle. When you catch your mind somewhere else a minute or
two later, repeat the process, and repeat it, and repeat it, over and
over, for at least ten minutes by the clock.

```

THEDRUIDRYHANDBOOK

Your first few sessions of concentration are likely to be fairly
demoralizing. For a while, you may even seem to be getting worse, not
better, at keeping your attention on the circle. You may catch your
mind jumping off in a new direction before you even get it back to the
circle from an earlier distraction. In fact, entire sessions may go by
with only a few seconds of attention to the circle—or none at all.
Keep with it, however, and you’ll notice three things happening. First,
the time your attention stays fixed on the circle between monkey-
expeditions will gradually increase. Second, the habit of returning to
the circle along the path of your mind’s movement will start to settle
into place, so that your monkey-mind begins running back to the cir-
cle as enthusiastically as it runs away from it. Third, and most impor-
tant, you’ll find yourself starting to follow your mind as it moves,
rather than losing track of the circle and not realizing it until later.
When your ten minutes of concentration includes at least five min-
utes of focused attention on the white circle, and when you can easily
catch the movements of your mind and bring it back to the circle,
you’ve learned what you need to learn from this exercise.Your prelim-
inary training is finished, and you’re ready to go on to meditation.
The difference between meditation and the exercises you’ve done
so far is that meditation is directed toward an idea, a written sentence,
an image, or something else you wish to understand. The subject of
your meditation is called its theme. Anything at all can be a theme for
meditation. Many spiritual schools have traditional sets of themes that
students use as the basis for their meditations during training.
The material in Part II of this book is meant to provide you with
themes for meditation. Each of the concepts from Druid symbolism
and philosophy included there is intended to lead you to some of the
subtler teachings and realizations of the Druid tradition. Don’t be
rigid about the choice of themes, however. If there are themes you
particularly want to explore in your year of Druid training, by all
means do so.


How do you select themes from a mass of written material like
“Wisdom of the Stone Circle?” First, break larger themes that interest
you up into pieces small enough for a single meditation.To start with,
this usually means breaking themes into sentences and phrases, or
selecting a series of sentences and phrases that contain the core ideas
of the theme. One common mistake of novice meditators is to choose
sprawling themes and hurry over them in a single session. More expe-
rienced meditators learn that one sentence or phrase is usually enough
for one session. The point of the exercise is how much you can get
from it, not how fast you can get through it.
Let’s use the first of the nine Druid concepts from Part II as an
example.You may be tempted to take the entire story of Einigen as the
theme for a meditation, but that won’t get you very far; it would be
like trying to read and understand a long book by flipping through its
pages in fifteen minutes. A more workable theme might be the first
sentence of the tale:

Einigen the Giant, the first of all beings, beheld three rays of
light descending from the heavens at the beginning of the world.
That’s a reasonable theme for a novice meditator. You may find,
however, that even shorter themes give you more than enough mate-
rial. This first sentence might more usefully be divided up into four
themes:
Einigen the Giant
The first of all beings
Three rays of light descending from the heavens
The beginning of the world
Let’s work with the first of these themes: Einigen the Giant. Select
your theme no later than the night before you’ll be meditating on it,
because part of the preparation for meditating on a theme is, literally,
to sleep on it. Just before you go to sleep, call it to mind, and let your
mind rest on it for a while. Repeat it silently a few times to yourself.

THEDRUIDRYHANDBOOK

Try to fall asleep with the words “Einigen the Giant, Einigen the
Giant” murmuring in your mind. In fact, the simple act of introducing
the words into your thoughts on the edge of sleep makes them part of
the material your dreaming mind will mull over.
In the morning, at your usual time for meditation, begin meditat-
ing in exactly the same way you began the concentration exercises.
Settle into the posture, relax, take one cleansing breath, and do about
five minutes of rhythmic breath with appropriate color breathing.
Then clear your mind completely for three silent breaths. If you find
it useful, have your concentration target in front of you, just as in the
concentration exercises, and keep your attention focused on it during
those three final breaths.Your mind is already trained to focus on the
white circle, and this can make it easier to keep your thoughts on
track.
After the three silent breaths, turn your attention to the theme of
the meditation. If the theme is expressed in words, repeat it three
times slowly and silently in your mind. If it’s an image, visualize it
clearly in your mind’s eye and hold the image for a few moments. In
either case, concentrate on it as intently as you can, turning your
attention away from everything else. The goal is to fix the theme
firmly in your mind, so that you can return to it whenever you wish.
Now you begin the process of meditation. Start with the theme
you’ve chosen, and think about it in a general way. Try to get a good
overall sense of it. If it’s a sentence or a phrase, go over it one word at
a time, making sure you understand exactly what it says. If it’s an
image, pay careful attention to every detail of color and shape, every
object in the picture.
A number of questions or issues are likely to come to mind as you
consider your theme. You may wonder about the implications of a
word in a sentence; you may puzzle over the meaning of a particular
color or object in an image; you may consider the way some part of


the theme relates to something in another meditation. This habit of
wondering, of asking questions of yourself, is vital in meditation.
Encourage it as much as you can.
Make a mental note of each question or issue you find in the theme.
When you feel you have a general grasp of the theme, choose one of
these questions and follow it out in thought as far as you can. Explore
its meaning, its roots or sources, its consequences and implications.
Turn it over and over in your mind, and try to figure out as much
about it as you possibly can. Continue this for ten minutes, then take
a cleansing breath to finish the meditation.
For example, in the case of our chosen theme, complete your pre-
liminaries, then repeat the words “Einigen the Giant” three times—
silently, slowly, and with total concentration. Now begin thinking
about the theme. Unless you know quite a bit about Celtic linguistics,
the name Einigen isn’t likely to communicate much to you. The fact
that Einigen was a giant is another matter. What is a giant? Why do
giants play so large a role in legend? What roles do they play? How
does Einigen relate to other giants of legend? What do giants symbol-
ize? What does it mean that so many legendary beings are humanlike,
but either much larger or much smaller than ordinary people? What
does size mean in myth and legend generally?
These questions and others like them may come to mind as you con-
sider the theme. Choose one of them: “How does Einigen relate to
other giants of legend?” You may recall that most legendary giants are
malevolent creatures fond of eating human beings. You may recall a
book on Norse mythology and think of the giants of that tradition.They
were all descended from the giant,Ymir, you remember, and Ymir was
the first of all beings—just like Einigen. That may lead you to consider
other mythologies you’ve encountered looking for other primordial
giants. Though it’s unlikely to happen in a single meditation, you may
find yourself suddenly grasping why so many traditional teachings place
a giant human form at the beginning of all things.

THEDRUIDRYHANDBOOK

As you proceed with the meditation, there is one essential rule: _Be
aware of exactly what you’re thinking while you’re thinking it._ This may
seem like a strange rule, but it’s the key to the entire method. Most
people, most of the time, let thoughts go drifting unnoticed through
their minds like leaves in an autumn wind—there one moment, gone
the next, leaving no trace of themselves behind. (For example, what
were you thinking about five minutes ago? Do you remember?) The
heart of discursive meditation is the process of thinking consciously—
and the only way to think consciously is to be conscious of what you’re
thinking.
As you try to do that, you may find yourself face to face with the
same difficulties you encountered in the concentration exercises.
Your thoughts may stray off in every direction you can imagine, and
some you probably can’t, instead of staying with the theme.
Memories of the past, worries about the future, apparently random
trains of thought set off by your surroundings or by nothing at all—
these thoughts may all come crowding into your mind.You may real-
ize that, for the last few minutes, you’ve been thinking of something
completely unrelated to your theme.You may realize that, for the last
few minutes, you haven’t been thinking of anything at all.
The remedy is the same as in the concentration exercise.When your
thoughts stray, bring them back to the point where you left your theme
following the route along which they strayed. When you find that
they’ve strayed off again, repeat the process, and repeat it, and repeat it.
On the other hand, you may find that you can’t come up with any
questions at all about your theme, or that the questions you do think
of lead you nowhere. You may find yourself with nothing to think
about at all, except the bare theme itself.This is another way that your
mind tries to wiggle out of the hard work of meditation.When it hap-
pens, simply hold the theme itself in your mind. Do your best to keep
your mind on it. If it’s an image, try to see it clearly in your mind’s


eye. If it’s a sentence, repeat it slowly in your mind. In either case, pay
careful attention at each moment to what it means, rather than letting
it turn into a meaningless pattern of shapes or sounds. Pursue the
meaning, either until some new point comes up for you to think
about, or until the meditation session is over.
If you’re like most beginning students, you will probably waste
seven of the ten minutes you devote to each practice session on stray
thoughts unrelated to the topic or on blank periods when nothing
comes to mind at all. You will probably spend another two minutes
bringing your awareness back to your theme.That leaves a total of only
one minute at most that will actually go to thinking about your theme.
This is frustrating, but inevitable. Unless you’ve spent years in a
monastery or a magical order, you’re unlikely to know anything about
how to use your own mind.That one minute of connected, meditative
thinking—scattered and diffuse though it may seem—is the key to all
the treasures of meditation. Scarcely less important are the two min-
utes you spend patiently bringing your thoughts back to heel. Keep
working at it, walking the Moon Path, and the potentials of Druid
meditation will unfold step by step before you.
Your second meditation should follow the same pattern, and the
one after that, and so on, day after day.The material in Part II provides
plenty of themes to start with. Once you’ve worked your way through
those, let yourself be guided by your own inspiration or, as Druids
often say, your own Awen. The books listed as further reading at the
end of each part of this book can be rich sources of themes for medi-
tation as well, as are the rituals in chapter 8. As you’ll soon discover,
you can find themes for meditation everywhere.
The things you learn about each theme constitute one of the bene-
fits of meditation. Indeed, novices often look on them as meditation’s
most important benefit. Through meditation, the symbols and teach-
ings of the Druid path will come to mean much more to you and will
unfold many more of their secrets to you than they ever will to those

THEDRUIDRYHANDBOOK

who merely read about Druidry. Over time, however, the meaning of
your themes will become less important than the experience of med-
itation itself. You will experience a slow but steady growth of inner
power and wisdom that comes with regular practice. Let this happen
in its own time; it can’t be forced or faked, and the gradual unfolding
is also relevant to the Druid path.
As your meditation practice deepens, you’ll learn that improve-
ment comes in cycles. Sometimes your meditations will be relatively
successful, and other times not. Progress in meditation comes in fits
and starts. At times, you may feel as if you’ve lost all the ground you
had gained. It can be easy to slip into a mood of frustration or dejec-
tion when this happens, but the Druid teaching of the cycle of the year
is relevant here: The bleak days before Imbolc, when it seems as
though winter will last forever, come right before the budding of the
first leaves of spring. Keep on meditating and the difficulties will
resolve in time.
After a time, you may find that ten minutes of meditation no longer
seems like enough. When you get to this point, add another five min-
utes, and stay at that level for a month or two at least before you add
any more. If you still feel you need more time, add another five min-
utes, and stay at that level for another few months. This gradual, step-
by-step expansion will help ensure that you don’t leap beyond your
actual abilities.
On the other hand, it’s best never to cut back on the length of your
practice sessions. If you’ve worked up to a twenty-minute session, that
should be your absolute minimum from then on. To a surprising
degree, progress in meditation comes from the simple fact of the time
you spend doing it. Although the temptation to decrease the length of
your practice sessions during difficult periods can be strong, the less
time you spend meditating, the longer it will take you to work your
way into a more productive phase.


#### Other Meditation Methods.

Discursive meditation is the heart of the Moon Path, but other types
of meditation have a place in Druid training as well. All of them
involve working with awareness and nwyfre to heal and balance the
self on many levels. Any such exercises known to the ancient Druids
were lost centuries ago, so the Druids of the Revival did the sensible
thing and borrowed effective methods from other traditions of spiri-
tual development. Over the last three centuries, these borrowings
have been reworked in the light of experience to form a toolkit of
additional approaches. Here are some of the best methods for novice
Druids.

**RECEPTIVEMEDITATION**

The discursive method of meditation described above differs sharply
from most Asian meditative methods. Another Druid practice—
receptive meditation—comes much closer to the disciplines of the
East. Receptive meditation is best done outdoors in the presence of
nature. The practice begins the same way discursive meditation does:
Take your meditation posture, relax, and use color breathing—green
in this case—to quiet your body and nwyfre. The method changes,
however, when you get to the point of concentration.
In receptive meditation, when you reach the point of concentra-
tion, you must widen the focus of your mind instead of narrowing it.
Try to be aware of everything around you, all at once. Open your
awareness completely. Attend to sights, sounds, scents, air move-
ments, and everything else, all together. If you’ve practiced the “splat-
ter vision” technique covered back in chapter 7 use it here; let the
entire universe enter into your awareness. If your mind starts to chat-
ter—and of course it will in the early stages of your training—bring

```
THEMOONPAT H
```

THEDRUIDRYHANDBOOK

your attention back to the totality of the world around you.You’re not
trying to reach a conclusion or a realization, as in discursive medita-
tion; you’re simply trying to open yourself to the dance of the living
Earth.
This form of meditation is a supplement to discursive meditation
rather than a replacement for it. In many ways, it’s simply an expansion
of the Earth Path practice of stillness, and it makes a good supplement
to your Earth Path work during and after your initiatory year. It can be
practiced as often as circumstances permit. If you have the opportunity
to plan a Druid retreat in a wilderness place, you can use long periods
of receptive meditation to get the most out of the experience.

**NWYFREEXERCISES**

The next three exercises bring nwyfre into your body from the outside.
They can help you open yourself to deeper contact with living nature.
All three can be strengthened by using color breathing immediately
before starting. Most people find light green the best color to use.

**Solar nwyfre exercise:**

This exercise charges your body with solar nwyfre and attunes you
with the solar current. Use it especially to dispell weakness, depres-
sion, and lack of energy. It’s also good for building up health after an
illness.
On a sunny morning between dawn and 10 A.M., find a place in the
open air where you can stand in direct sunlight. Face the Sun, eyes
closed, with as much of your body as possible in sunlight. Raise your
arms to the sides and bend your elbows so that your arms form an arc,
your fingertips pointing upward and your palms turned toward the
Sun. Keep your arms as relaxed as possible and gently spread your fin-
gers. Breathe slowly, feeling the sunlight soak into your body, and
especially into your fingertips.


After one to three minutes, bring both hands inward to your head,
stopping when they’re a few inches from your forehead, with your
palms facing you and your fingers nearly touching each other. Imagine
the sunlight flowing into your head from your fingertips, illuminating
the middle of your head.
Next, move your hands slowly down from your forehead to your
solar plexus, maintaining the imagery of light pouring from your fin-
gertips into the midline of your body. When your hands reach solar-
plexus level, sweep them out to the sides and bow as low as you can,
then return to the first position with your arms spread wide to greet
the Sun. Repeat the entire process three or nine times.

**Telluric nwyfre exercise:**

This exercise is used to charge your body with telluric nwyfre and to
attune with the telluric current. Use it especially to dispell tension,
stress, and feelings of disconnection from nature, to release obsessive
thoughts or memories, and to calm your mind after difficult times.
The amount of time you practice it is less important than the place; it
should be done standing on the bare earth, not on pavement or an arti-
ficial floor. It is best performed in a natural place where the land has
suffered little or no damage at human hands. In fact, you’ll find that
the effects are different when you do the exercise on grass, bare soil,
stone, or sand.
The exercise is essentially the solar nwyfre exercise in reverse.
Hold your arms in a downward arc, hands about a foot out from your
sides at hip level, your fingers pointing forward and your palms facing
the ground. Again, relax your arms as much as possible and spread
your fingers gently apart.Try to feel the presence of the Earth beneath
you; with practice, you’ll begin to perceive the telluric current itself
flowing up from below. Breathe slowly and deeply for one to three
minutes, feeling the Earth energies flowing into your fingertips.

```
THEMOONPAT H
```

THEDRUIDRYHANDBOOK

Now bring your fingertips inward toward the vital center two
inches below your navel, stopping a few inches from your body,
palms toward you and fingertips nearly touching. Imagine the Earth
currents flowing from your fingertips into the midline of your body.
After a short time, move your hands slowly upward, maintaining the
imagery of the telluric current pouring into the midline of your body
from the vital center up to the throat center. At this point, separate
your hands, sweeping them up and out to your sides, and bow deeply,
then return to the first position with your hands turned toward the
ground. Again, three or nine cycles of the exercise are enough.

**Tree nwyfre exercise:**

The third exercise works with the nwyfre of trees. Like Sun and Earth,
trees of many species radiate nwyfre that benefits human beings.There’s
also another factor in play here: the trees benefit as well. Just as trees
thrive on carbon dioxide, which human beings breathe out as a waste
product, and produce oxygen, which human beings need to survive, so
the excess nwyfre produced by many trees heals humans, while the
nwyfre produced by humans nurtures trees. The same is true of other
plants and many other things in the natural world. Indeed, an entire sys-
tem of Druid natural medicine unfolds from the same principle.
Start the exercise by selecting a tree. Some varieties are considered
more beneficial to human beings than others: pine, fir, and cedar are
held to be best, with oak, beech, and apple not far behind. Elm is tra-
ditionally avoided, as its nwyfre is unhealthy for human beings.
Ask the tree’s permission before exchanging nwyfre with it. Like
other nonhuman creatures, trees don’t understand human language,
but they do understand our emotional patterns—often better than we
do. Stand before the tree and ask it silently if it’s willing to share its
nwyfre with you. Feel for the answer and behave accordingly.
If the tree gives permission, approach it and come in contact with
it.There are two traditional ways to do this.The first focuses the heal-


ing effects on your nervous system. To do this, stand or sit with your
back pressed against the trunk. You can amplify the effect by putting
your left hand on the small of your back with the palm turned out,
touching the tree, and your right hand on your belly just below your
navel, palm in.
The second method focuses the healing effects on the organs of
your chest and abdomen.To do this, face the tree with your feet a few
inches away from the base of the trunk, then lean the front of your
body and your forehead against the tree. In this position, you can
amplify the effect by placing your hands at forehead level, forming an
upward-pointing triangle with your thumbs and index fingers, and
spreading your other fingers out comfortably. Let your forehead rest
against the tree in the center of the triangle. Bend your arms around
the trunk, as though embracing the tree with your elbows.
In either posture, relax your body as much as possible and feel the
tree as a living presence. An attitude of openness, friendship, and
affection will yield the best results here.Ten or fifteen minutes of quiet
presence next to a large, healthy tree will leave your own nwyfre
cleansed and energized, and will do much the same for the tree.

**THEDRUID’S EGG**

The three exercises above draw nwyfre into your body.There are
times, however, when it’s necessary to do the opposite and seal out
surrounding currents of nwyfre. Around angry people, for example,
nwyfre takes on their emotions, and it’s all too easy to be caught up in
these negative feelings and drawn into an unwanted quarrel.The same
thing can happen with other emotional states.
On a more extreme level, sites of suicide, murder, or other violent
events can turn into dangerous pools of stagnant and disruptive
nwyfre, where sensitive people can be overwhelmed. Such things play
a much larger role in human life than most people ever suspect. You

```

```

THEDRUIDRYHANDBOOK

need serious magical training to handle the more extreme examples of
this sort, but any Druid should know how to shield himself or herself
from inappropriate nwyfre.The best way to do this is with an exercise
called the Druid’s Egg.
The Druid’s Egg is best learned through meditation. Start by tak-
ing your meditation posture, relaxing your body, and taking a cleans-
ing breath to clear stagnant nwyfre from your system. Next, spend
about five minutes in violet color breathing before proceeding to three
silent breaths, as though you were about to start a meditation.
Instead of calling a theme to mind, however, say silently to yourself:
“I formulate the Druid’s Egg.” Imagine that the air suddenly becomes
solid around you; see yourself at the center of a sphere of crystal—the
Druid’s Egg. Feel it around you, solid and firm, extending out several
feet from your physical body. Pay attention to all sides of it—in front
of you, behind you, to your left and right, above and below you. See
it perfect and flawless, and concentrate on the idea that when the
Druid’s Egg is around you nothing can penetrate to harm you.
Hold the image in your mind as intensely as possible for several
minutes, then say silently: “I release the Druid’s Egg.” As soon as you
say this, imagine the crystal sphere dissolving back into thin air. Close
with a single cleansing breath.
Practice this regularly, until the Druid’s Egg formulates as soon as
you silently repeat the words and stays without effort until you repeat
the words that dissolve it. Once you can do this, you can call on the Egg
outside of meditation, whenever it’s necessary to screen out unwanted
nwyfre. The Egg should only be kept in place for a short time, and
should always be deliberately dissolved, so that you don’t interfere with
your body’s ability to absorb and release nwyfre as needed.

# THE YEARLONG INITIATION

traced out in this book marks your first step into the

world of Druidry. It doesn’t complete the process of

becoming a Druid—that lasts as long as you follow the

Druid path. Nor is it anything more than a first brief

introduction to learning about Druidry and the three

paths that define its living core. It doesn’t touch on the

wealth of additional arts, crafts, traditions, and teachings

that have gathered around Druidry since the dawn of the

Revival. The image of the turning circle of time, which

plays so important a part in Druid philosophy, has a les-

son for us here. In your journeys in Druidry, just as in the

Earth’s journey through the stations of the year, every end

is also a beginning. The end of your initiatory year is the

beginning of a larger initiation—your journey into the

wider realms of Druidry.

```
AFTERWORD: PATHS TO THEFORESTTEMPLE
```

THEDRUIDRYHANDBOOK

The route you take in that journey is yours to choose. While some
spiritual traditions prescribe a fixed course of study from beginning to
end with no room for individual choice or differences in personal
needs, Druidry has long embraced a more open-ended approach. Most
traditional Druid orders give novices a structured curriculum at first,
but encourage more experienced students to take a progressively larg-
er role in designing their own course of training, until finally, each one
follows a unique path. This follows from the core principles of the
Druid way. The point of Druid training, after all, isn’t the mass pro-
duction of initiates with identical skills and opinions, like so many
cookies from a single cookie cutter. Rather, it’s the awakening of the
unique personal gifts and insights within each individual Druid.
For some Druids, this means that Druidry is a solitary path from
beginning to end.There’s nothing wrong with this choice. Becoming a
Druid doesn’t require membership in an organization, initiation ritu-
als, or grandiose titles. It requires only reverence for the living Earth
and the practice of a nature-centered spirituality and way of life.These
can be done in perfect solitude.
For other Druids, however, taking part in the community of Druids
is a welcome option. That community includes groups of all sizes and
kinds. Some Druid groups are small, informal circles of friends who
meet to celebrate the holy days and share explorations in the world of
living nature. Others are international Druid orders with monthly
newsletters, membership dues, training programs, and annual meet-
ings at which hundreds of Druids gather from a dozen countries. Still
others fall into the ample space between these two extremes.
Depending on your needs and interests, any of these can be part of
your journey in Druidry.
It’s only fair to mention that the approach to Druidry taught in this
book isn’t welcome in all of today’s Druid organizations.The legacy of
the Druid Revival is still a hot button in some circles, and Druids who
openly embrace the Revival’s traditions come in for angry words now


and then. Some groups on the Reconstructionist side of Druidry—
those who attempt to reconstruct primitive Celtic religion as exactly
as possible—still dismiss the entire Revival as “fake Druidry.” Some
nationalist Druids aligned with surviving Celtic cultures insist that
nobody can be a Druid without Celtic ancestry or fluency in a Celtic
language. Fortunately, most modern Druid organizations are more
tolerant than this.

THE ANCIENT

ORDER OF DRUIDS

IN AMERICA



# ONE ORGANIZATION THAT

embraces the full heritage of the Druid Revival is the

Ancient Order of Druids in America (AODA), which I

presently head as Grand Archdruid. AODA began in 1912 as

the American branch of the Ancient and Archaeological Order

of Druids, a British Druid order founded in 1874 by the

Rosicrucian mystic and Druid Robert Wentworth Little. In its

early years, AODA had close links with Freemasonry, but it

became a fully independent order in the course of the twenti-

eth century. Today, it welcomes men and women of all reli-

gious, ethnic, cultural, national, and linguistic backgrounds,

including Druids affiliated with other traditions and organiza-

tions within Druidry. AODA affirms Druidry as an inclusive

path of nature spirituality, inspired by the ancient Druids and

the traditions of the Druid Revival but oriented to the ecolog-

ical and spiritual needs of the present and future. The book

you’re holding is a good general guide to its outlook and

approach.

```
THEANCIENTORDER OFDRUIDS INAMERICA
```

THEDRUIDRYHANDBOOK

AODA offers three grades of initiation. Members join as
Candidates and may remain at this level if they choose. Participation
in the training program and advancement through the degrees is an
option, not a requirement. Those Candidates who decide to seek
advancement work through a year-long study program before receiv-
ing the first degree, the degree of Druid Apprentice. The study pro-
gram includes the Earth, Sun, and Moon Paths and one of seven
spirals—traditional arts long associated with Druidry. The book
you’re reading right now is the main First-Degree textbook.
Druid Apprentices who want to advance further work through a
more advanced two-year curriculum to achieve the Second Degree,
the degree of Druid Companion. Druid Companions who choose to
go beyond this stage create and follow a three-year, self-designed
study program to qualify for the Third Degree, the degree of Druid
Adept. The curriculum for all three degrees may be found on the
order’s Web site at _[http://www.aoda.org/about.htm](http://www.aoda.org/about.htm)_. The current First-
Degree curriculum is included below.
Most members of AODA follow a solitary Druid path or work in
small informal groups and initiate themselves through solo rituals pro-
vided by the Grand Grove, the governing body of the order. Second-
degree members, however, have the right to organize local study
groups that confer the Candidate and First-Degree initiations and
practice other rituals.Third-Degree members have the right to organ-
ize local groves, which confer all the AODA degrees and perform
every aspect of AODA ritual work. E-mail lists and other networking
opportunities help AODA members at all levels work together as a
community of like-minded Druids.
AODA asks a modest one-time fee for lifetime membership, and a
similar fee for each of its three degrees of initiation. For details of these
fees and the membership application process, as well as for other infor-
mation about AODA, please visit our Web site at [http://www.aoda.org](http://www.aoda.org)
or write to us at AODA, PO Box 1181, Ashland, OR 97520.


THE AODA

FIRST DEGREE

CURRICULUM



# THE FOLLOWING STUDIES HAVE

been established by the Grand Grove of AODA for the

First Degree, the degree of Druid Apprentice. Under

ordinary circumstances members who have enrolled in

the Order and received the Candidate initiation must per-

form the following steps and wait a minimum of one year

before receiving the First Degree. The Grand Grove may

waive some or all of these requirements in special cir-

cumstances.

The First Degree curriculum consists of four parts.

The Earth Path of nature awareness and service to the liv-

ing Earth, the Sun Path of seasonal celebration, and the

Moon Path of meditation are required of all Candidates.

In addition, each Candidate must study one of the seven

Spirals, studies which have traditionally been part of the

Druid Revival—poetry, music, divination, healing,

magic, sacred geometry, and Earth mysteries—and gain a

basic level of competence in her or his chosen Spiral.

```
THEAODA FIRSTDEGREECURRICULUM
```

Candidates who wish to study more than one Spiral are encouraged to
do so but this is not required for the First Degree.
Candidates should keep a Druid journal and note down details of
all their Druid studies. The Druid journal need not be shown to any-
one, including AODA officers, but functions as a resource for your
First Degree examination.When you complete the First Degree study
program, contact the Grand Grove for examination.
Updates and more information on the First Degree curriculum,
including recommended reading lists for all Paths and Spirals, can be
found online in the AODA Web site at _[http://www.aoda.org](http://www.aoda.org)_.

**THE EARTH PAT H**

1. At least once each week during your Candidate year, spend fif-
    teen minutes or more in direct contact with the natural world.
    This may be in a wild place (such as a forest or a seashore), in
    a place recovered by nature (such as an overgrown vacant lot),
    or in a place created by humanity and nature together (such as
    a garden or a park). Part of your time in nature should be spent
    practicing stillness, which simply involves sitting, keeping your
    mind empty of thoughts and distractions, and being wordlessly
    aware of everything around you. Part should be spent practic-
    ing focus, which involves detailed attention to some specific
    thing—a tide pool, a wild plant, the living things in a six-inch-
    square patch of grass, or the like.
2. Read at least nine books on nature, focusing on the natural his-
    tory of the area in which you live, learning about the living
    things, the natural ecosystems and communities, the patterns
    of weather and water, and the development over time of the
    land. Relate as much of this information as possible to your
    own experiences of nature.
3. Make three changes in your lifestyle in order to take less from
    the Earth and give more back, and maintain those changes
    through your Candidate year. Different people lead different
    lives, and a change that would be easy for one might be difficult

or impossible for another; Druidry also affirms the need of indi-
viduals to make their own choices, so the choice of changes to
make is left up to each Candidate. Whatever you choose should
be something you’re willing to keep doing for an entire year,
and a small change you can sustain will do more good than a
larger one that goes by the wayside when it proves unworkable.
```
4. Plant at least one tree during your Candidate year, and water
    and tend it until it is well established.

**THESUNPAT H**

1. During your Candidate year, celebrate a cycle of Druid holy
    days. In AODA the two solstices (around December 21 and
    June 21 each year) and the two equinoxes (around March 20
    and September 23 each year) are traditional and should be part
    of your Druid calendar. Many members of the AODA also cel-
    ebrate the “cross quarter days” of Imbolc (February 2),
    Belteinne (May 1), Lughnasadh (August 1), and Samhuinn
    (November 1), while others choose different days based on
    their own spiritual and cultural interests. The holy days may be
    celebrated alone or with others, using any ritual you prefer.
    Participating in community celebrations qualifies, as long as
    you’re not simply a spectator. Write a detailed account of each
    celebration in your Druid journal, and write at least nine pages
    on the place of seasonal celebrations in your own Druid path
    and in the Druid tradition in general.

**THEMOONPAT H**

1. Practice some form of meditation regularly during your
    Candidate year. While any form of meditation that involves
    focusing and directing the attention will qualify, discursive
    meditation is particularly recommended. Daily meditation
    using this or another approach is best, and while many people
    who are new to meditation need to work up to daily practice,
    this should be a goal to achieve by the end of your Candidate
    year.

THEDRUIDRYHANDBOOK

2. The Sphere of Protection ritual should be learned and practiced
    daily during your Candidate year, or if you prefer another basic
    working to protect, balance, and purify your body of nwyfr,
    this may be substituted. Details of the Sphere of Protection can
    be obtained from the AODA Web site or by mail from the
    Grand Grove.

**THESEVENSPIRALS**

**Spiral One: Poetry**

1. Read and study poems by at least nine poets. Memorize three
    or more of these poems, totalling at least fifty lines.
2. Read at least three other books on the writing of poetry and
    use information from these in your own poetic practice. From
    these readings and your study of poetry, select at least thirty
    themes for meditation and use them in your daily meditations.
3. Keep a poet’s journal. Set aside time at least once each week to
    write poems and do exercises.
4. Complete at least eighteen finished poems and revise them as
    needed. Nine of them must be in traditional poetic forms such
    as sonnet or haiku, while the others may be either formal or
    free verse as you prefer.
5. In your Druid journal, write at least three pages on the role
    you think poetry has in Druidry in general, and in your own
    Druid path.

**Spiral Two: Music**

1. Either select and acquire a musical instrument, or take up
    singing. Practice two hours a week as an absolute minimum—
    thirty to sixty minutes a day is a better target to aim for—using
    lessons, books, videos, and other sources of instruction to
    guide you. If you can attend at least one workshop on your cho-
    sen instrument during the year, do so.
2. Learn at least three solo pieces well enough that you would be
    willing to play them in public. If you have the chance, do so.


3. Read at least three books on music aside from your instruc-
    tional books. From these readings, select at least thirty themes
    for meditation, and use them in your daily meditations.
4. Write at least three pages in your Druid journal on the place of
    music as a Druid art.

```
Spiral Three: Divination
1.Choose a method of divination and begin learning how to use it.
```
2. Perform daily divinations with your chosen method, using a
    simple spread, for at least nine months—in other words, at
    least 270 divinations. Keep a record of your daily divinations in
    your divination journal, and review them at intervals.
3. Perform at least nine other divinations, besides your daily read-
    ings, during your initiatory year.
4. Create a personal handbook of divination, writing out the
    meanings of each of the symbols in your divination method.
    Half a page per symbol is a good minimum.
5. Read at least three books on divination during your initiatory
    year. From this reading, select at least thirty themes for medi-
    tation, and use them in your daily meditations.
6. In your Druid journal, write at least three pages on the role
    you think divination has in Druidry in general, and in your own
    Druid path.

**Spiral Four: Healing**

1. Take classes to get certified in first aid and cardiopulmonary
    resuscitation.
2. Keep a health diary during your initiatory year. At least once
    each week, and more often whenever it seems useful, review
    your own current physical, emotional, and mental state. Keep
    track of anything that seems to affect your health in a positive
    or negative direction.
3. Select a healing art to study during your Candidate year.
    Choose and study at least three books on the subject, select
    from this reading at least thirty themes for meditation, and use
    them in your daily meditations.

```
THEAODA FIRSTDEGREECURRICULUM
```

THEDRUIDRYHANDBOOK

```
4a. If your chosen healing art is herbalism, learn the properties
and healing powers of nine common herbs. If at all possible,
either grow them yourself or visit a place where they grow,
and devote some of your Earth Path time to learning about
them and their place in nature. Get to know them thoroughly
and use them for your personal health care needs during your
Candidate year. Make at least one infusion, one decoction, one
tincture, and one salve. Any time you use one of the herbs for
healing, take notes on your symptoms, how you treated them,
and what happened.
4b. If your chosen healing art is something other than herbalism,
do a comparable amount of work in that art; for example, if
you decide to study acupressure, learn the routes of the
meridians, memorize the location and healing effects of at
least thirty important treatment points, use them as needed,
and keep notes on your experiences.
4c. Whether you choose to study herbalism or some other healing
art, a study program, correspondence course, or apprentice-
ship which includes at least an equivalent amount of work is a
valid alternative to the program of independent study out-
lined here.
```
5. Write at least three pages in your Druid journal on the place of
    healing as a Druid art, in the tradition in general and in your
    own Druid path.

**Spiral Five: Magic**

1. Memorize a ritual for opening and closing magical space, and
    practice it at least once each week during your Candidate year.
    The AODA Grove opening and closing ritual is recommended
    for this purpose.
2. Using any preferred method, learn to summon, direct, and
    banish the energies of the three Druid elements until you can
    work with any of them at will.
3. Prepare and consecrate a wand, a cauldron, and a crane bag, as
    Druid magical working tools of nwyfre, gwyar, and calas
    respectively, using any preferred method.


4. Learn to place magical intentions in stones, as a way of making
    simple talismans and amulets. Do this at least three times for
    specific purposes, using any preferred method. Keep notes in
    your Druid journal on the results.
5. Read at least three books on magic during your initiatory year.
    From this reading, select at least thirty themes for meditation,
    and use them in your daily meditations.
6. In your Druid journal, write at least three pages on the place
    of magic in Druidry in general and in your personal Druid
    path.

**Spiral Six: Sacred Geometry**

1. Learn to construct a circle, a _vesica piscis_ , an equilateral trian-
    gle, a square, a √2 rectangle, a √3 rectangle, and a Golden
    Rectangle on paper, using pen, straightedge and compass, with-
    out having to follow written instructions.
2. Do at least two of these constructions outdoors on the Earth,
    using rope and stakes instead of pen and ink. Describe the
    experiences in your Druid journal.
3. Read at least three books on sacred geometry. From these
    books, gather at least thirty themes for meditation, and use
    them in your daily meditations.
4. Set aside time to practice sacred geometry at least once each
    week during your Candidate year. Use books on sacred geom-
    etry as a source for constructions and diagrams to draw in your
    practice sessions.
5. In your Druid journal, write at least three pages on the role
sacred geometry has in Druidry in general, and in your own
Druid path.

**Spiral Seven: Earth Mysteries**

1. Acquire a set of dowsing tools, learn how to use them, and
    practice with them until you can get reliable results—for
    example, finding misplaced objects in your home.

```

THEDRUIDRYHANDBOOK

2. Read at least three books on Earth mysteries. From these read-
    ings, select at least thirty themes for meditation and use them
    in your daily meditations.
3. At least once during your initiatory year, make a visit to a
    sacred site. Research the place in written sources, and learn as
    much as you can about it before you go there. See if it forms
    part of an alignment with other sites in the area. When you
    arrive, practice your Earth Path skills of stillness and focus. If
    at all possible, dowse the area for energy lines and currents
    within the Earth. Write about the experience in your Druid
    journal.
4. In your Druid journal, write at least three pages on the role
    you think Earth mysteries have in Druidry in general, and in
    your personal Druid path.

9. There are several different versions of this prayer, any of which can
be used here.The most important variations are in the first and last
lines. The oldest versions of the prayer, which date from the years
when Christian Druidry was still the most common element in the
Revival, begin “Grant, O God...” and end “...the love of God and
all goodness.” Later, less sectarian Druids said “Grant, O Divine
Spirit...” or simply “Grant, O Spirit...” and used the same term in
the last line. The revival of goddess spirituality in the last century
saw some Druids start the prayer “Grant, O Goddess...” and end
it “...the love of the Goddess and all goodness.” Recent versions
have been all over the theological map, and the form given above
draws from one of these. Yet though different Druids invoke a
remarkable assortment of spiritual powers, the things they ask for
remain the same: protection and strength, understanding and
knowledge, the ability to know what is right and to love it, and
ultimately love for all existing things.

**_Spiritual_**

**_Practice Rooted_**

**_in the Living Earth_**

#### John Michael Greer

Foreword by Philip Carr-Gomm

**“**

```
This is an altogether admirable bookthat wears its
author’s considerable scholarship lightly. A valuable edition to
any collection of books on the history of Druidry and espe-
cially the modern druidic revival, it goes far beyond this in
being both a deeply spiritual and eminently practical book.
—JOHNMATTHEWS,AUTHOR OF SECRETS OF THEDRUIDS ”
A LIVING TRADITION of nature spirituality rooted in Celtic antiquity and
revived to meet the challenges of contemporary life, Druidry offers a path of har-
mony through reconnection with the green Earth. The Druidry Handbook is a
hands-on manual of traditional British Druid practice. Explore the Sun Path of
seasonal celebration, the Moon Path of meditation, and the Earth Path of living
in harmony with nature—all tools for crafting an earth-honoring life here and
now. From ritual and meditation to nature awareness and ecological action, John
Michael Greer opens the door to a spirituality rooted in the living earth with a
mix of philosophy, rituals, spiritual practices, and lifestyle issues.
```
**“**

```
In this book, with great clarity, Greer performs
alchemy. He discovers and articulates the gold that lies
hidden within the obscure texts of the Revival Druids, and
succeeds with consummate skill in offering a perspective
that redeems much of modern Druidry—revealing it to be
a heritage around which we can grow and build a vital and
dynamic spirituality.
” —PHILIPCARR-GOMM,FROMTHEFOREWORD
