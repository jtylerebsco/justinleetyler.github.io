# Book of worship for church and social meeting / compiled by T.B. Forbush. -- Boston : American Unitarian Association, 1891, c1889. 

## USE.

This little book was compiled to meet the desire of a
single church for some brief service for each of the five
(possible) Sunday mornings of the month. To make it a
trifle more complete, evening, Christmas, Easter, and national
services were arranged. Friends kindly thought it might
have wider usefulness: hence its publication. The prayers,
arranged largely from Martineau's "Common Prayer," were
added, to make it more helpful in social and lay meetings.
That it may promote the spirit and habit of worship is the
only wish of THE COMPILER.

## FIRST SUNDAY

### ALL STANDING.

Be thou, O God, exalted high / And as they glory fills the sky / So let it be on earth displayed / Till thou are her and their obeyed.

### RESPONSIVE READING.

I WAS glad when they said unto me,
Come, it is our holy day;
Let us go into the house of the Lord;
Let us take sweet counsel together;
Let our feet stand within his gates;
Let heart and voice give thanks unto him.
For the Lord is good, his mercy is everlasting,
And his truth endureth to all generations.
Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee ;
In whose heart are thy ways.
Blessed is the temple hallowed by thy name.
Pray for peace within its walls :
Peace to young and old that enter there;
Peace to every soul abiding therein.
For friends' and brethren's sake, I will never cease to say,
Peace be within thee.
What though the heaven of heavens cannot contain him,
And he dwelleth not in temples made with hands;
What though his way is in the deep, and his knowledge is
too wonderful for us,
And before him we are as children that cannot speak;
Yet touched by the altar's living glow,
We learn to lisp his name,
And try the wings that beat for his refuge,
And flee as a bird to the mountain.
O Lord, when we cry unto thee from the deep,
And wait for thee as they that watch for the morning,
Thou wilt have regard to our entreaty,
And the voice of our prayer thou wilt not despise.
O house of the Lord's praise,
Peace be to them that love thee!

### ALL.

Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on 
earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. 
Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that trespass
against us. Lead us not into temptation; but deliver us
from evil. For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and
the glory, forever and ever. Amen.

Glory be to the Father who is in heaven, The High and Holy One.
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, World without end, Amen.

### PRAYER.
For a Lay Service.

ETERNAL GOD, our heavenly Father, Giver of every
good and perfect gift : we heartily thank thee for thy
bountiful kindness to us and to all men; for life and all its
blessings; for health and prosperity; for brotherly love,and
the means of doing good; and above all for thy grace and
truth, and for our hope of life eternal. Increase, O Lord,
our knowledge, and so illuminate us with the brightness of
thy truth, that no ignorance or sin may pervert thy blessings.
Give us such a sense of thy goodness that we may ever
devote ourselves to thy service in word and deed; and
praising thee both with our lips and our lives, may go on
through thy guidance to the joy of life everlasting. Amen.

## RESPONSIVE READING.

I WILL lift up mine eyes unto the hills,
From whence cometh my help.
My help cometh from the Lord,
Who made heaven andearth.
He will not suffer thy foot to be moved ;
He that keepeth thee will not slumber.
The Lord is thy keeper;
The Lord is thy shade upon thy right hand.
The sun shall not smite thee by day,
Nor the moon by night.
The Lord shall preserve thy goingout and thy coming in,
From this time forth and even forevermore.
Therefore will we not fear, though the earth be removed,
Though the mountains be cast into the midst of the sea.
God is our refuge and strength,
A very present help in trouble.
O taste and see that the Lord is good,
Blessed is the man that trusteth in him.
Cast thy burden on the Lord,
For none that trustsin him shallbe desolate.
As the mountains do stand about Jerusalem,
So the Lord is round about his people.
The Lord is a sun and a shield;
The Lord will give grace and glory.
Trust in him at all times;
Pour out your heart before him.
For his merciful kindness is great towards us,
And the truth of the Lord endurethforever.
Blessed be the name of the Lord,
From this time forth and even forever more.

after age the living seek thee, and find that of thy faith
fulness there is no end. Our fathers in their pilgrimage

to their children be thou the cloud by day and the fire by
night. Where butin thee havewe a covert from thestorm,
or a shadow from the heatof life? Thou aloneknowest our
temptations; no secret of our heartis hid fromthee. Purify
us, we pray thee, fromall guile. In prosperity keepus from
pride and indifference; in adversity save us from hardness
and distrust. O thou sole Source of peace and righteous
ness, take now the veil from every heart, and unite us,
with all thy prophets and saints, in one light of faith, one
beauty of holiness, one repose on thee. Amen.

### RESPONSIVE READING
Glory to God in the highest,
And on earth peace, good-will to men
Through the tender mercy of our God,
A dayspring from on high hath visit us,
Giving light to them that sit in darkness,
And guiding our feet in the way of peace.
How beautiful upon the mountains
Are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings.
That publisheth peace,
That proclaimeth glad tidings of salvation.
He shall not strive, nor cry,
Nor cause his voice to be heard in the street.
A bruised reed shall he not break,
And the smoking flax shallhe not quench.
The spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him;
The spirit of wisdom and understanding,
The spirit of counsel and might,
The spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord;
Anointing him to preach good tidings to the poor;
To bind up the broken-hearted ;
To comfort them that mourn;
To proclaim liberty to the captives ;
The opening of the prisons to them that are bound;
To announce the acceptable year of the Lord.
In him was life,
And the life was the light of men.
He was tempted like as we are,
And no fault was found in him.
He went about doing good;
Proclaiming everywhere, The kingdom of God is at hand.
Glory be to God in the highest,
And on earth peace, good-will to men.

```
But in righteousness serveth the people,
Andestablisheth truejudgment in thy gates.

Then shall violence be no more heard in thy land,
Or wasting anddestruction within thy borders.
```
Then shall justice roll down as waters,
And righteousness as a mighty stream.

Thou shalt call thy walls Salvation,
And thygates Praise.

For righteousness exalteth a nation,
But injustice is a reproach to any people:

And to righteousness hath the Lord called thee,
Andgiven theefor a light to the kingdoms.

Oh! pray for the peace of our country;
All they shallprosper who love thee:

For a Lay Service.
TERNAL and ever blessed Ruler of all the kingdoms
of the earth! From a little company thou hast mul
tiplied our people into a mighty nation; thou hast planted
us in quiet resting-places; thou hast committed to us a
mightytrust. May we enjoy all our immeasurable blessings
not in pride and self-will, but reverently, as from thee.
Deepen the root of our life in everlasting righteousness.
Make us equal to our high privilege, soberin the use of
freedom,just in the exercise of power, generous in the pro
tectionof weakness. Mayall our lawsbe founded in equity
and executed with uprightness. May wisdom and knowl
edge give us stability, and true brotherhood be the spirit
of our people. So with peace in its gates and prosperity
in its homes, may this nation be thine to the end of time.
Amen.
