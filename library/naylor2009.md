## Introduction

###### In the controversy surrounding the publication in 1975 of the first

###### volume of R. H. S. Crossman's Cabinet Diaries,, which the British

###### government had sought first to discourage and then to proscribe through

###### legal proceedings, contentious questions were posed. Weighed in the

###### balance were such concerns vital to a democracy as the need for secrecy in

###### the highest reaches of government, on the one hand, and, on the other, the

###### right of the citizenry to be informed witnesses and critics of the actions

###### carried out in its name by the government. In the wide-ranging

###### discussion, opposed principles of what in fact constituted the public

###### interest were advanced: for several months, Great Britain engaged in a

###### debate concerning the merits of'open' and 'closed government.' At law,

###### the Lord Chief Justice of England strove to balance the rival claims,

###### attempting to secure both the desirable ends of an appropriate measure of

###### 'confidentiality' for the business of government and an earlier public

###### accountability for Cabinet proceedings. Whatever the merits of that

###### accommodation - his decision cleared the way for the publication of

###### Crossman's memoirs - the Labour government responded politically by

###### strengthening 'closed government,' in the form of measures which the

###### Cabinet deemed necessary for the effective functioning of government.

###### Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the proceedings was the attitude

###### evident in official circles, shared by political leaders and preeminent civil

###### servants, to the effect that the citizenry had little business inquiring

###### precisely how Britain was governed. By design, the work of the Cabinet,

###### including its delegation of some major responsibilities to select Cabinet

###### committees, remains veiled, although the fact of that veiling is now

###### openly recognized. Her Majesty's Government remain of the opinion that

###### confidential aspects of Cabinet business should not be revealed by those

##### who have taken part for a period of fifteen years; only with the passage of

###### thirty years will the public be granted access to its actual records.

###### Certainly few voices are so reckless as to call for immediate disclosure of


2 Introduction

the business of the Cabinet, its committees, or the counterpart commit-
tees which are staffed by senior civil servants, although a case can be made
that an excessive stifling of information about the process of government
may mislead the public and impair the functioning of government in
present-day Britain.^1 Thus the question persists whether in the name of a
better informed, more responsive citizenry measures of ' open govern-
ment ' might secure an understanding of what transpires in the ' corridors
of power' and round the Cabinet table.
While that question will receive continued attention in years to come, a
related question has emerged from this exchange of views: how, and why,
has secrecy come to envelop the practice of modern Cabinet government?
It is my purpose to address that question in this book, developing an
answer from a variety of records which enable us to gain the necessary
historical perspective. In the first place, the vast bulk of the records of
Cabinet government now enter the public domain after thirty years,
affording an appreciation both of the process and proceedings of Cabinet
government at this remove. Secondly, the curtains are parted upon
Cabinet secrecy closer to the contemporary scene by a range of ministerial
memoirs, culminating in the brightly illumed scene which Crossman
depicted for the Wilson administration of 1964-70. Precisely because the
government failed to ring down the curtain upon Crossman's disclosures,
a limited but informative comprehension of contemporary practices is
possible. Since some aspects of government are now closed even to
ministerial memoirists, the disclosures made by Crossman bring us closer
to the workings of Cabinet government in Britain than we are likely again
to approach, unless the government's disposition alters. With this added
dimension, the record of the development of canons of Cabinet secrecy
very nearly to the present time can be written; that topic constitutes a
portion of what I have set about to assess.
Yet I did not have such a theme in mind when first I embarked upon a
study of the evolution of the Cabinet Secretariat, an institutional product
of the crisis of government in the midst of the First World War which
proved more adaptable to peace-time than many of the innovations
associated with the war leadership of David Lloyd George. Initially, I
anticipated that the scope of this book would be delimited by the regime
which Sir Maurice Hankey headed at the Cabinet Office from late 1916
until his retirement as Secretary to the Cabinet twenty-two years later.
That period possesses a historical coherence which is reflected in the first
six chapters of this work, which deal with the antecedents of the Cabinet
Secretariat, the initial organization of Hankey's office, the crisis in the
fortunes of the Secretariat which followed upon Lloyd George's fall from
power in 1922, and the completion of the process whereby the Secretariat
emerged as the central agency for the preparation and disposition of


###### Introduction 3

###### Cabinet business - a process complete well before Hankey left Whitehall

###### Gardens in 1938. These twenty-two years witnessed the institutionali-

###### zation both of the Secretariat as an office free from partisan taint and of

###### Hankey as confidant and adviser of successive premiers. Concurrently,

###### Hankey and the Cabinet Office -' a man and an institution' - discharged a

###### role, never formally defined, as the custodians of Cabinet secrecy. In this

###### last regard, the precedents set before the Second World War frame the

###### post-war debate over the place of such secrecy within a free society.

###### In an ironic fashion, this last aspect of the present study came into focus

###### with Hankey's struggle to publish his First World War memoirs, based

###### upon a detailed, private diary which he kept while Secretary to the

###### Cabinet. For nearly twenty years, two of his successors and three Prime

###### Ministers refused to sanction the publication of disclosures which they

###### thought destructive of the doctrine of the Cabinet's collective respon-

###### sibility and of the confidential relationship between ministers and civil

###### servants. Hankey himself fell victim to that concern for the protection of

###### Cabinet secrecy which he had played the major role in formulating. He

###### resisted strongly the proscription of his memoirs, at a time when officially

###### informed memoirs of the Second World War were in full flood, because

###### Winston Churchill, assisted by Attlee's administration, had secured a

###### suspension of the usual canons of Cabinet secrecy. Not until 1961 did

###### HMG grant Hankey his say about Britain's ' Supreme Command' in the

###### Great War, and even then they looked the other way rather than admit the

###### propriety of his diarist's pen. For a full generation after his retirement,

###### the official view of Hankey's memoirs directs our attention to the custody

###### of Cabinet secrecy: restrictions in its name severely limited accounts of

###### the working of British inter-war government written from within by

###### former ministers. Buttressing these conventions was the ubiquitous

###### Official Secrets Act of 1911 and 1920, despite the fact that it had been

###### written for purposes very different from those for which the government

###### threatened its use. In time, however, familiarity with the threat bred

###### contempt, and a discrediting of the Official Secrets Act followed, until it

###### could no longer effectively bear the weight of maintaining Cabinet

###### secrecy.

###### With the weakening of this prop, accomplished both by governmental

###### abuses and by increasing revelations of' official secrets' in a procession of

###### post-war ministerial memoirs, the Crossman affair served as denoue-

###### ment: although the government sought to proscribe the detailed record of

###### Cabinet deliberations and the depiction of the processes of government,

###### in which the Cabinet Office is intimately involved, they based the

###### Crown's case not upon the ailing statute but instead upon presumed

###### standards of ministerial conduct. In the legal proceedings, the Cabinet

###### Secretary, Sir John Hunt, necessarily shed light upon the contemporary


###### 4 Introduction

###### practices of Cabinet secrecy; thus the Crossman case afforded me a means

###### of pursuing this dimension well within the thirty year period. Yet Hunt

###### and the Cabinet Office succeeded in establishing a legal doctrine of

###### ' confidentiality' as a new weapon in the defence of Cabinet secrecy. To be

###### sure, other duties of the contemporary Secretariat remain masked from

###### public scrutiny; further, the doctrine of' confidentiality' may well tell in

###### future against any premature disclosures in ministerial memoirs concern-

###### ing the work of the Cabinet Office. Its activities will - for the foreseeable

###### future - be kept at a remove of thirty years, save for whatever depictions

###### ministerial memoirs may bring our way, perhaps fifteen years after the

###### fact. Whether that genre, particularly in its ' Cabinet diary' form, is likely

###### to flourish as it has in recent years remains problematical.^2

##### The final chapter of this book is concerned in the main with the custody

###### of Cabinet secrecy from Hankey's retirement until the recent regime of

###### Sir John Hunt. In its course I offer only a cursory commentary upon the

###### actual workings of the War Cabinet Secretariat of 1939-45 ~ whose

###### records are available in the Public Record Office - in order to establish the

###### ease of transition from Hankey's peace-time operation to the much more

###### extensive scope of the activities over which his successor, Sir Edward

###### Bridges, presided. The Cabinet Office's role and its procedures clearly

###### had been established in Hankey's time; what demands further explor-

###### ation, as noted, is the role of the Cabinet Office as custodian of Cabinet

###### secrecy in the post-war years.

###### How then take the measure of the historical role both of the Cabinet

###### Secretariat and of the man who placed his imprint upon it? An obvious

###### albeit incomplete answer centers upon those very records which Hankey

###### maintained for the Cabinet, which prior to December 1916 functioned

###### without benefit of any record-keeping mechanism. Much more is

###### involved than the best known of those records, the Cabinet Minutes;

###### while useful, in some ways the minutes are among the least revealing

###### sources for a reconstruction of the process of Cabinet government: 'The

###### minutes and conclusions were deliberately prepared objectively and

###### impersonally, and designed to record agreement and not promote

###### controversy; behind many of the decisions lay tensions and influences

###### which are not reflected in the official records.'^3 Nonetheless, the Cabinet

###### Minutes provide an estimable record of decisions, and at times they

###### reveal surprising details concerning policy or individual ministerial

###### attitudes on leading questions. In addition, there exists a vast range of

###### other government records which contributes to a historical evaluation

###### both of Cabinet proceedings and the Secretariat's role; in the latter case,

##### Hankey's office maintained a collection of files which bears directly on its

###### tasks, as regards not only its organization of Cabinet business but also its

###### acquired role as the custodian of Cabinet secrecy. A tightly defined

###### institutional account of the Secretariat affords a detailed explanation of

such records: S. S. Wilson's The Cabinet Office to 1945, published for the
Public Record Office in 1975, is indispensable to an understanding of the
mechanics of the organization. Yet such an approach is perforce limited,
because the institution itself did not evolve in accord with abstract
principles of organization; instead, the Cabinet Secretariat's activities
were shaped by political considerations and personal forces which must
be taken into account if its role, and that of the Cabinet Secretary, are to
be understood. While Wilson's study recognizes Hankey's immense
contribution, he does not deal with the shaping influence which the first
Secretary had upon the Cabinet Office, nor does he hazard an estimate of
his important role as adviser, although in reality that personal contri-
bution is inextricably intertwined with his conduct of office.
Thus a full evaluation of the development of the Cabinet Secretariat
must be set in a comprehensive political framework: concerns of foreign
and imperial policy occasionally intrude, since they too exercised a
significant, albeit short-term, influence upon the extent and style of
Hankey's operation. Biographical considerations enter, extending con-
siderably beyond the career of Hankey himself, which Stephen Roskill
has assessed in a magisterial fashion. Other civil servants, Hankey's
deputy Tom Jones first among them, contributed to the development of
the office; politicians, with Lloyd George holding primacy of place,
played a vital part in establishing a pragmatic role for the Cabinet Office,
which existed on parliamentary sufferance and accommodated to political
realities. The Cabinet Secretary's relations with other civil service
interests, ably represented by the powerful Permanent Secretary to the
Treasury, Sir Warren Fisher, require scrutiny, no less than his dealings
with five premiers and scores of influential ministers - in their sum
Hankey's dealings with the official and political worlds had a far-reaching
impact upon the development of the Cabinet Office. In assessing these
constraints upon Hankey's operations, this study deals directly with the
nature of British government in the course of our century: it examines the
preponderant departmentalism of the pre-war period, which gave way to
the fitful, erratic but forceful leadership of Lloyd George; the auxiliary
role played by the Secretariat in forwarding his style of government,
whether or not it be characterized as ' prime ministerial government'; the
concurrent development of a powerful government bureaucracy, which
persisted even when Lloyd George's successors sought a return to
normalcy; the tightening net of Cabinet secrecy; and finally., the conflict
between precepts of 'open' and 'closed government' which built for
decades before securing some measure of resolution as a result of the
Crossman case. That the Cabinet Secretariat was involved in all these
matters is a testimony to its centrality in the processes of modern British
government.
The ways in which such a role was assumed are informed by a number


6 Introduction

of non-official accounts by participants, both on the ministerial side and
from within Whitehall Gardens: although these sources are subjective
and some are hostage to political or personal interests, they make possible
an assessment of the development of the Cabinet Office and the roles
played by its principals in the years to 1938. Among these sources, of
paramount importance are the diaries maintained - on the whole,
consistently - by Hankey and Jones, who retired from government
service in 1930; by contrast, Hankey's successors have held it improper to
keep any such account of personal commentary on affairs of state. As a
result, only for this formative stage in the office's history will we be able to
locate the Cabinet Secretary as adviser within the context of the
institution. For that reason, and for the information which the diaries
contain, I have drawn extensively from those accounts; they possess an
immediacy and a force which shed light upon the way in which Cabinet
government was carried on, nearly to the outbreak of the Second World
War. In utilizing both official and private accounts - published and
unpublished, contemporary and reflective - this study seeks to depict the
full range of Secretariat activities and to examine the impact of the office
upon modern Cabinet government, through the depiction of the insti-
tution and the men who in a real sense created it. Such an approach is of
course dependent upon the use and interpretation of the written word,
more cautiously phrased in government records than in a variety of
private forms, but the first generation of those who served in the Cabinet
Office is long gone, and their successors are evidently not free to speak in
any detail to the issues raised in the last chapter.
There is another important source which should be mentioned in
connection with any evaluation of Hankey's own role as adviser,
particularly in matters of British and imperial defence policies, where
repeatedly he chose to exert his influence. The Cabinet Secretary, ever
the man of records, systematically collected important papers, written as
part of his official responsibilities, intending subsequently to draw upon
these in what he foresaw as his own historical 'Magnum Opus.' Such a
volume never materialized - his memoirs, based in the main upon his
diary, did not extend beyond the Paris Peace Conference - but the
collection eventually passed to the Public Record Office. Readily
apparent in these documents are the causes which Hankey served with
special fervor and the ways in which he operated as adviser. We have no
expectation of seeing the likes of such a collection, maintained by the
Secretary to the Cabinet, ever again; his successors in that post have
determined upon a far less conspicuous historical role for themselves.
In sum, the career of Sir Maurice Hankey constitutes a remarkable
chapter in the development of an institution. While the range of his
advice, derived in part from his own military experience, exceeded that


```
Introduction 7
```
which any of his successors have commanded, his person is recognizable
in the description of the Cabinet Secretary recently offered by Sir Harold
Wilson, following upon his own retirement as Prime Minister:

The Secretary of the Cabinet is, in a sense, the "prime minister's permanent
secretary," to use a phrase of the... Secretary's predecessor [Sir Burke Trend]
on handing me my first brief in 1964; but his loyalty is, no less, to the Cabinet and
the doctrine of Cabinet government ... He advises also on the practices and
conventions about the conduct of ministers in relation to collective Cabinet
responsibility, as well as on other matters affecting collective responsibility and
loyalty.^4

Not only did Hankey establish the Secretariat as the agency for the
conduct of Cabinet government, but as well he laid out the institutional
paths which his successors continue to tread. Ultimately the man and the
institution stand as one, together meriting a unified historical treatment,
which in turn contributes to an understanding of the ways in which Great
Britain is governed.


```
The origins of the Cabinet Secretariat
```
As the debacle at the Somme ground to a halt in the chilling autumn rains
and the squalid muck of the battlefield, the Allied leaders gathered in
Paris, in mid-November 1916, to assess the military situation. Two men
who shared growing doubts about the British role in the war took a
' stroll' before a morning session of the conference, exchanging views
about their country's contribution. One of them was the well-known and
controversial politician, David Lloyd George; the other, hardly a public
figure, was Lieut Col. Maurice Hankey, a leading military adviser to the
government who had served as Secretary to the pre-war Committee of
Imperial Defence and during the war as Secretary to the three commit-
tees which had, in turn, worked with questions of military policy for the
Cabinet. Although a recent appointee as Secretary of State for War,
Lloyd George had already become frustrated with the deference con-
sistently shown to the military views voiced by the Imperial General Staff
and the British Expeditionary Force exhibited by Prime Minister
Asquith, head of a Coalition government.
According to Lloyd George's recollection, Hankey took the initiative
and sketched proposals for a re-organization of the British war effort:

We both felt that nothing in the way of a change in the conduct of the war had been
accomplished and that in the absence of some dramatic coup things would go on as
before until we slide into inevitable catastrophe ... I was in favour of an
immediate resignation [on his own part]. To this Sir Maurice was opposed until
some means of effecting a change had first been attempted. I can recall that as we
passed the Vendome Column, Sir Maurice paused and said: 'You ought to insist
on a small War Committee being set up for the day-to-day conduct of the war,
with full power. It must be independent of the Cabinet. It must keep in close
touch with the P.M., but the P.M., as the Head of Government, could not manage
that. He has a very heavy job in looking after the Cabinet and attending to
Parliamentary and Home Affairs. He is a bit tired, too, after all he has gone
through in the last two and half years. The Chairman of the proposed Committee
must be a man of unimpaired energy and great driving power.'^1

The origins of the Cabinet Secretariat 9
```
Although Hankey did not himself record such a striking initiative on his
part,^2 he too had grown disillusioned with the traditional ways in which
Britain was governed, in the midst of a war grown beyond any nation's
control. Nor was he alone in official circles in his dissatisfaction with the
direction and vigor of Britain's war effort, which reflected in part the
inadequacies of the governmental and institutional framework within
which Asquith's regime operated - the legacy of nineteenth-century
Cabinet government. Thus the confidences shared by Lloyd George and
Hankey revealed anxiety about policy and concern with the mechanism of
policy-making: institutions which had served splendidly in the palmy
days of Victorian England were by 1916 foundering on the destructive
reefs of modern warfare.
No two men did more to bring Cabinet government into the twentieth
century than Lloyd George and Hankey: whatever was said on that
fateful walk in Paris matters little beside the shared recognition of
purpose. Both men sought first and foremost to win the war;^3 that
Asquith had to yield his high office after eight years, and an established
pattern of government succumb in the wake of his overthrow, is a
measure of the dedication and fixity of purpose shown by these critics of
the old order. Malaise had seeped into political precincts almost from the
very first months of the war, which had witnessed strained relations
between civil authorities and the military; in the spring of 1915 the
acerbic Lt-General Henry Wilson had retorted to Asquith's ill-tempered
jibe that the war had produced no great generals: 'No, Prime Minister,
nor has it produced a statesman.'^4 No one could deny that the British war
effort ground unevenly: by the autumn of 1915, the failure to break
through at the Dardanelles served to provoke a serious government crisis.
Lord Milner, nearly a decade in the political wilderness, reflected more
than a bruised ego in commenting 'the change of Ministry will not bring
us victory without a change in method.'^5 Milner nonetheless recognized
the need for changes in the leadership, commenting in August 1915 on
the coalition formed in May that only ' the consistent display of qualities
which are the absolute antithesis of what we know of Asquith, McKenna,
Simon, et hoc genus omne> and... of A. J. B[alfour], Lansdowne and most
of their Unionist colleagues' would save the day - and the nation.^6 That
methods of governing and personnel mattered to Milner is clear in his
joining with younger Unionist critics, including Leopold S. Amery, F. S.
Oliver, and Geoffrey Dawson in weekly meetings of a 'ginger group'
whose purpose was stated later by Amery as ' somehow or other to secure
a change of government.'^7
As a result of his public stand, Milner attracted the attention of other
critical peers; among them was Lord Sydenham, CID Secretary from


###### io A man and an institution

###### 1904 to 1907, who attributed the ' terrible mistakes' in the conduct of the

###### war directly to Asquith's leadership: 'The ragged discussion of the

###### Cabinet... lies at the root of our misfortunes. '^8 Since the formation of the

###### coalition, Sydenham had urged the creation of a War Council of some five

###### or six individuals 'with full and complete charge of all matters relating to

###### the conduct of the War'; only such' a complete change of methods' would

###### sustain a successful war effort. Yet Milner and Sydenham failed at that

###### time to achieve their goal; another year of brutal but inconclusive warfare

###### was required before Asquith fell and ' a complete change of methods'

###### instituted. In the interim, the same flaws which had undercut the

###### Cabinet's first attempt to delegate responsibility for the conduct of the

###### war - a War Council established as 'a supplement to the Cabinet for

###### exploring some of the larger questions of policy rather than as an

###### instrument for the day to day conduct of the war '^9 - hampered the efforts

```
The origins of the Cabinet Secretariat 11
```
It is really too scandalous that The Times should be able to publish these accounts
of Cabinet meetings. But seeing that the whole of the daily discussions and
negotiations between Carson, Curzon, Northcliffe, Lloyd George and others are
probably at the disposal of The Times through various intermediaries, this
publication is scarcely to be wondered at.^14

Additional criticism from outside the coalition regime centered on the
Cabinet's discursiveness no less than its laxness: Leo Amery, no friend to
the regime, noted Sir Edward Carson's contempt - in words which echo
Kitchener's suspicions - 'of the present system of governing by 22
gabbers round a table with an old procrastinator in the chair.'^15
The massive loss of life on the Somme served to intensify the
dissatisfaction with Britain's military ineffectiveness, which in turn
raised fundamental questions about the structure and personnel of the
government. Such influential Tories as the Earl of Derby and the former
premier, A. J. Balfour, were now prepared to withdraw their support
from the Asquith-led coalition; as important, they were now prepared to
transfer their allegiance to their longtime political foe, Lloyd George,
whom Balfour described to King George V in June 1916 as' out to win the
war.'^16 Balfour also recognized the need to alter the 'accustomed
machinery' of government, a structure to which the incumbent premier
was deeply attached.^17 When events finally led to Asquith's fall, the
climate existed for a change in system as well. Other Unionists also noted
the growing disparity between Lloyd George's growth in stature and the
disarray of the coalition government.^18 In July 1916 Viscount Esher, who
tended his political sources closely, drew an obvious conclusion: 'I
should not be surprised if Asquith had to go and little L. G. reigned in his
stead.'^19 In the meantime, and within the coalition, the Unionist leader,
Bonar Law, expressed his own doubts about the system to which
Asquith, premier since 1908, adhered in war as he had in peace:

when he joined Asquith's Cabinet [in May 1915] he was astonished at the lack of
method, the absence of any agenda or minutes. He told Asquith this. The latter
said that everyone who joined the Cabinet made the same observation, but
speedily became reconciled to the method of doing business and saw its advantage
for the special purposes.^20

Asquith's refusal to acknowledge that the lack of an official record of
Cabinet proceedings accessible to Cabinet members reflected an ana-
chronistic bent which flew in the face of the increasing complexity of war-
time government. Even before the war, ministers had had to deal with
inter-departmental matters^21 which required co-ordination and con-
sensus at the Cabinet level. Asquith's stubborn refusal to depart from
past verities reflected his philosophical disposition become political
reality, 'Wait and See.' Yet the Great War waited upon no man nor the
traditional methods of governing Britain.


###### 12 A man and an institution

###### In such a darkening setting, Hankey and Lloyd George - who were not

###### personally close^22 - looked to a strongly centralized, possibly authori-

###### tarian, executive as Britain's only escape from ineffective government.

###### Even prior to the Somme offensive, Lloyd George had confided to C. P.

Scott, editor of the Manchester Guardian:' We are losing the war if indeed

###### we have not already lost it.'^23 In a parallel fashion, Hankey had in

###### December 1915 despaired of the Cabinet's conduct of the Dardanelles

###### operation; although his advice had been rejected, Hankey was not so

###### much troubled by that rejection as by the Cabinet's inability to come to

###### terms with the issue. After a month's dithering, the continued British

###### presence at Gallipoli (and in yet another peripheral expedition at

###### Salonika) hung in the balance, and Hankey recorded in his diary:

###### Cabinet met in the morning and decided to evacuate Sulva and Anzac [bases

###### opened in support of the main offensive in the Dardanelles], retaining Helles for

###### the present. No decision as regards Salonika... This delay in decision is

###### absolutely fatal... The Government are really dreadfully to blame. They put off

###### decisions, squabble [,] have no plan of operation, and allowed themselves to be

###### dragged into this miserable Salonika affair at the tail of French domestic politics. I

###### can see only one solution - to suspend the constitution and appoint a dictator.^24

###### Nor, from Hankey's perspective, did the situation improve when the

Dardanelles expedition was completely abandoned, because the Cabinet

###### continued to talk to no purpose. The War Committee proved no more

###### successful an agency for war planning than its predecessors, and Hankey

###### noted a succession of its 'dreadful' meetings in early November 1916:

The War Cmt work is hopelessly congested, great questions dealing with Man

###### Power, the [illegible] Board, Food Supply, and Finance all urgently awaiting

###### settlement. Yet I could not get a meeting for tomorrow because Runciman was

###### going for a day's shooting, Lord Curzon for a week-end, and Lord Crawford to

###### address his former constituents. I managed to get a meeting for Monday but the

P.M. said 'You won't get anyone.' Today's meeting had to end soon after 1 p.m.

###### to enable Ministers to attend official luncheons. Thus and thus is the British

###### Empire governed at a critical stage of the war. I have done all I can to get

###### meetings; to crystallize woolly discussions into clear-cut decisions, and to

###### promote control - but the task is a Herculean one!^25

##### To be sure, Hankey's diary contains an element of the self-serving -

###### understandably a characteristic of most such records - but there can be no

###### doubt that his complaints with the War Committee were well-grounded;

##### not even the Prime Minister could dispute its shortcomings, as he

###### perceived them:

The two main defects of the War Committee, which has done excellent work, are

###### (1) that its numbers are too large, and (2) that there is delay, evasion, and often

###### obstruction on the part of the Departments in giving effect to its decisions.

###### I might with good reason add (3) that it is often kept in ignorance by the

Departments of information, essential and even vital, of a technical kind, upon the


```
The origins of the Cabinet Secretariat 13
```
problems that come before it; and (4) that it is over-charged with duties, many of
which might well be delegated to subordinate bodies.^26

Despite this recognition that the flow of information from the depart-
ments had to be improved and regularized, Asquith himself proved to be
an obstacle to conveying information in the opposite direction, by failing
to give sufficient attention to Cabinet decisions.^27 Reliable, unambiguous
information was difficult to secure through institutional means in 1916;
political gossip flourished in its absence.
Thus the coalition disintegrated, a victim of its own institutional
malaise rather than a political conspiracy engineered by Lloyd George.^28
Yet the Secretary of State for War played the key role - Bonar Law, the
Tory leader, confided to Hankey: ' Lloyd George is at the same time the
right hand to the P.M. and the leader of the opposition'^29 - and he
intended to gain personal direction of a three-man War Committee,
which would possess 'full powers, subject to the supreme control of the
Prime Minister, to direct all questions connected with the war.'^30 Asquith
would retain the right to refer any matter from the committee to the full
Cabinet as well as nominal responsibility, but Lloyd George demanded in
exchange for his continuance in office nothing less than ' a fundamental
reform of the British constitutional machinery for waging war.'^31 At this
juncture the War Minister sought not the succession to Asquith but
instead the taking of war powers from his indecisive hands.^32 The choice -
however disagreeable - remained with the Prime Minister.
Asquith negotiated the terms concerning the scope and powers of the
proposed committee with Lloyd George and his Tory associates, and
Hankey had a hand in drafting the agreement. Yet Lloyd George was
warned to beware of Hankey's actions in the final stages of the gathering
crisis, whatever his degree of sympathy for reform; Admiral 'Jackie'
Fisher, who knew Hankey well, judged him 'extravagantly loyal to his
immediate chief and would sell his best friend in the interest of his
chief.'^33 It is clear, however, that Hankey's role in these days was that of a
mediator, because throughout he desired Asquith's continuance in office;
in fact, he had reservations about Lloyd George's 'dictatorial' bent and
regarded his 'publicity and press methods' as 'intolerable.'^34 His loyalty
to Asquith, to the moment of his resignation, remained above reproach,
but there remained a war to be won.
Mediation between the Cabinet colleagues proved impossible in face of
the public discussion of the emasculated role which Asquith had been
assigned. In particular, the publication in The Times on 4 December of an
article which declared that Asquith was acting under duress and could
not be considered as master of the government caused the premier to
decline the honorific functions which Lloyd George and his Tory
colleagues insisted upon. Despite Lloyd George's disclaimer of respon-


```
14 A man and an institution
```
```
sibility for the article, relayed to Asquith in a conciliatory if disbelieved
fashion, the Prime Minister chose to resign office; after the Unionist
leader, Bonar Law, deferred to him, David Lloyd George assumed the
supreme direction of the war effort and the premiership in the bargain.
Whether Asquith had hoped to foil the efiforts of his colleagues by
resigning and in due course emerging as the indispensable man, alone
able to sustain a government, is not here the issue; what is of import is that
his actions in responding to the Times' article signaled an inflexible
repudiation on his part of the hard-won progress towards a re-
organization of the war machinery.^35 His attitude all but assured a
continuance of the old methods, masked by some cosmetic surgery
performed on the extant War Committee. From an institutional per-
spective, the events of the first week of December established that the
price of fundamental reform was nothing less than Asquith's deposition:
ironic indeed is the fact that Asquith chose to depose himself.^36
```
The re-organization of government which Hankey had prepared at Lloyd
George's behest - tailored to Asquith's continuance in office - was
quickly abandoned. In its place Lloyd George, commissioned to form a
government on 7 December, headed a small War Cabinet of five; only
Bonar Law among them assumed departmental responsibilities, while
Milner - returned from the wilderness - Curzon, and the Labour leader,
Arthur Henderson, sat without executive tasks. Authority was vested
collectively in the War Cabinet, with whom the Prime Minister would
meet on a regular basis; unlike the November proposals, divided
responsibility was out of the question. Lord Sydenham might claim some
degree of paternity for the principle of the reform, but Milner himself had
given even more concrete form to the idea, in recommending to Bonar
Law on 2 December that supreme direction of the war effort could not be
vested in one man, because of the vast field of operations. What was
required was a' Super Cabinet' of three to five men, although he thought
five 'almost too many': 'They are in fact an Autocrat, a Dictator, or
Supreme War Lord in Commission, the Prime Minister being the Head
Commissioner... They must all feel responsible for the whole of it, all the
time... They will have to do a lot of Thinking and Deciding. They
should have to do precious little else.'^37
Lloyd George consulted with Hankey on his very first day in office; the
two discussed 'the personnel of the new Govt., the procedure of the new
War Ctee., and the future of the war.'^38 Although Hankey turned
immediately to prepare a memorandum on the last topic, by the 9th he
was in harness as Secretary to the War Cabinet, confronting the task of
administrative reform, bringing his experience to bear in building the
new to repair the faults of the old system. He was much aided in his efiforts


```
The origins of the Cabinet Secretariat 15
```
that the desire for basic change was shared by men as essentially
conservative as Balfour, Derby, Carson, and Bonar Law, who shared
with Curzon the sense that ' the country ... is not merely willing to be
led, but is almost calling to be driven' and the conviction that the time for
an overhaul of governmental organization was long overdue:

No one will deny that a system, however embedded in the tradition of the past and
consecrated by constitutional customs, which was attended by ... defects, was a
system which was destined, immediately it came into contact with the hard
realities of war, to crumble into dust at once ... I do not think that anyone will
deny that the old Cabinet system had irretrievably broken down, both as a war
machine and as a peace machine.^39

```
Curzon's commentary, widely shared during the war, is important in
understanding the survival of this reform of Cabinet government when,
in the post-war years, much that bore Lloyd George's political mark was
discredited and discarded.
While the passing years would reveal Hankey's own conservatism, in
December 1916 he stood as Lloyd George's agent in revolutionizing the
mechanism of government in the name of winning the war. While he
regretted Asquith's departure from Downing Street, he had no hesitation
in working with the new regime, although initially he held reservations
about the personnel of the proposed War Committee:
```
The new War Ctee. [i.e., with Asquith remaining as premier] is really ridiculous.
Bonar Law is by common consent the poorest figure on the present War Ctee.
Carson, on the old Dardanelles Ctee. was positively pitiful and worse than Bonar
Law. Henderson is an untried man, and it's scarcely possible that his education
can have fitted him for the job. Really it all depends on Lloyd George, who is
brilliant but often unsound. The others are merely representatives of the noisiest
groups in the House of Commons to prop him up, and there is no member of the
House of Lords. No one would say that these four were the wisest hands to win the
war - two are really feather heads. It is a mere political expedient of the most
transparent kind to tide over a difficult crisis.^40
Hankey's attitude stemmed from his fear that as Secretary he would be
trapped between the Prime Minister and the War Committee, an
unwelcome predicament which disappeared with Lloyd George's leader-
ship of the War Cabinet. Though Law and the little known Henderson
joined him on that body, Carson was excluded, and in his place two peers
eased Hankey's reservation on that score. Yet the inclusion of Milner
troubled many, Hankey among them, as he noted: ' I had to see Lord
Milner by appointment and spent two hours with him. I have always
hated his politics but found the man very attractive and possessed of
personality and got on like a house on fire.'^41
Hankey had every reason to be pleased with the role which Lloyd
George gave him in the new regime, involving his counsel in questions of
policy as well as appointing him Secretary to the War Cabinet. Given the


###### 16 A man and an institution

###### extraordinary sway Hankey was to exercise in this post over more than

###### two decades, it is well to recall that there were rivals for the position, one

###### at least prominent in the new premier's own Welsh entourage; yet

###### another confidant of Lloyd George, Tom Jones, noted that claim but

###### added ' there is already a something Hankey who has had long experience

###### of such work, and was before the war Secretary to the Committee of

###### Imperial Defence.'^42 Certainly Hankey's appointment proved most

###### important in the creation of a new system of Cabinet government, and

###### what has been described as 'the ending of Cabinet informality' arguably

###### involved the passing of classical Cabinet government.^43 Immediately

###### apparent was the assumption of supreme responsibility by a five-man

###### War Cabinet, replacing a cumbrous structure which had divided

###### planning if not responsibility. Other far-reaching changes in the manner

###### of Cabinet government were less evident: a network of Cabinet commit-

###### tees was instituted to secure the co-ordination of the vast range of war-

###### time governmental activities; at the center of the new machinery, a

###### Cabinet Secretariat had been established to hold the entire operation

###### together. Put in simplest terms, the Cabinet Secretariat was intended to

###### secure full communication between the executive authority vested in the

###### War Cabinet and the departments, which were charged with carrying out

##### Cabinet decisions. Because that flow had proved such a daunting problem

###### during the war years, new arrangements had to be forged if the Lloyd

###### George regime were to avoid the failures of its predecessors. If the

###### informality and 'amateurism' which had characterized nineteenth-

###### century Cabinet government had been thoroughly discredited, could

###### system and 'professionalism' be put at the service of the twentieth-

###### century Cabinet?

###### To secure such organization of Cabinet business, systematic records of

#### Cabinet proceedings were officially maintained for the first time in British

###### history: not only were the decisions recorded, but often the process

###### whereby those war-time decisions were reached became a matter of

###### record. Not only did these minutes and 'Cabinet papers' regularize the

###### conduct of Cabinet government, but, in a way which no one foresaw at the

###### time, they have become available to inform historical understanding

###### of Cabinet activities, since they were made available at the Public

###### Record Office a half-century later. Prior to the establishment of the

###### Cabinet Secretariat, no attention whatever had been paid to the

###### historical dimension of Cabinet business: no agendas were set, no

###### decisions were recorded, no minutes were circulated or filed.

###### Some years after this innovation, Hankey was delighted to discover

###### what he viewed as a precedent for the maintenance of Cabinet Minutes.

lished in The Times dealing with the papers of King George III. What
must have caught Hankey's eye was one short pasage:

a very frequent occurrence in all of George Ill's Administration, until Pitt
became Prime Minister, was that Ministers sent the King a Minute of Cabinet
and forgot to keep a copy of it. Then they asked for it to be returned; and the
request, although complied with, was not always unaccompanied by just rebuke.
Occasionally the King did not restore it until he had taken a copy with his own
hand, on at least one occasion through sheer good nature to save trouble to a
harassed Minister, but more often evidently from distrust of his careless habits.^44
Fortescue elaborated on the form of these 'Cabinet Minutes' in an
exchange of correspondence with Hankey: he informed the Cabinet
Secretary that George Ill's Cabinets met only at his behest, alone to deal
with questions which he placed before them. In turn they informed the
monarch of their deliberations: 'Having met, the Cabinet submitted its
opinion in the form of a Minute of Cabinet, which began with a list of the
members present, place (often a private house), time, and proceeded to
the resolution. Such Minutes were drawn up by the Minister for the
Department concerned, often so hastily that words were omitted, and
often ungrammatically and sometimes almost illegible.'^45 Although
these minutes were irregular and sparse in terms of content, Hankey took
to them with enthusiasm, extended his research into the medieval period,
and concluded that ' Cabinet Minutes' stretched back into the mists of
the fourteenth century (for the Privy Council), were revived in the
eighteenth century, and did not disappear until Queen Victoria's reign.
Hankey used a very selective historical approach for one contemporary
purpose: 'Their existence disposes of the argument which followed the
institution of the Cabinet Minutes by Mr. Lloyd George that this was
such an outrage to tradition as to make Mr. Gladstone turn in his grave!'^46
While Hankey sought remote institutional precedent for the work of his
Secretariat, he was unaware that records of Cabinet discussions far
closer in style to those minutes which he kept had been maintained, albeit
for private purposes, by several ministers in the era of Gladstone and
Disraeli.
These records, which possess considerable value for the historian of
the Victorian Cabinet - who has very limited documentary sources at his
disposal which touch upon the dynamics of Cabinet policy-making^47 -
serve to ' lift the veil' from actual Cabinet meetings, in the case of Lord
Carlingford's Journal in connection with the Gladstone ministry on the
verge of collapse in 1885.^48 Similarly, Viscount Sandon's Cabinet Journal
sheds considerable light upon Cabinet discussion of the Near Eastern
crisis of 1878, although Sandon maintained his record only for three
months. Ironically, Sandon's glimpse serves to show that the nineteenth-
century Cabinet scrupulously avoided keeping records: on 24 May, the


18 A man and an institution

Foreign Secretary, Lord Salisbury, collected the several copies of a
memorandum upon which the Cabinet had based its policy, and he
'burnt them with some matches over the grate - and Lord J. Manner's
copy was also burnt, he being absent from gout.'^49 Limited in purpose,
the journals of Carlingford and Sandon are close: to the type of record
maintained by Hankey than are the 'Minutes' which he claimed for
precedent, but they constituted no precedent for his role - nor were they
known to him.
Yet Hankey's investigation of precedent poses for us one question,
namely why had the rudimentary practice of informing the monarch
concerning the fact of Cabinet discussion lapsed in the nineteenth
century. In truth, it had not, because the ' Cabinet Minute' in no precise
fashion metamorphosed into a communication known as 'the Prime
Minister's letter.' Hankey thought that the two forms overlapped - he
identified the last ' Cabinet Minute' of the eighteenth-century type in
Melbourne's hand in 1839 and detected what he called 'a Cabinet letter
from the Prime Minister two years earlier'^50 - but the Royal Archives'
collection of prime ministerial letters dates only from 1868.^51 The form of
the letter differs from the formal character of the 'Cabinet Minute,'
but it served to accomplish the same limited purpose: the monarch was
informed of the Cabinet's conduct of affairs of state. Its different style is
accounted for by the continuing evolution in Cabinet government: a
Prime Minister had unquestionably come to head the Cabinet by the
mid-nineteenth century, and the responsibility of informing the monarch
accompanied such authority; as well, the initiative had by this time
passed to the Cabinet, and the 'Prime Minister's letter' reflected the
Cabinet's intentions rather than a mere response to matters first raised by
the King. With these adjustments, there remains substantial continuity
between the two: neither was intended as a record of Cabinet business;
the documents were not subsequently available to the Cabinet or the
premier, and in that sense they were very much ' occasional' pieces. As a
result, Hankey was quite devoid of precedent for the maintenance of
formal Cabinet Minutes: the organization of a Cabinet Secretariat
represented a radical departure from past practices.
Nonetheless, the letters written by the Prime Ministers afford some
otherwise unobtainable information about Cabinet proceedings in the
years to 1916. Drafted after each Cabinet meeting, these letters often
reflect the personal interests of, and immediate pressures upon, each
premier - facing other engagements, possibly preoccupied, perhaps even
bored by the convention - as he sat at the table round which the Cabinet
had recently gathered, to inform the monarch about Cabinet proceed-
ings. By and large, the leading ministers were not over-generous with
information: on one occasion, Gladstone 'padded' his account of


```
The origins of the Cabinet Secretariat 19
```
proceedings to assuage Victoria's complaint with ' very meagre news' of
the previous Cabinet meeting.^52 Nor is 'inform' a description aptly
applied to the letters sent to Edward VII by the penultimate premier of the
old order. Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman; the King was often irritated
with the lack of information conveyed to him.^53 Campbell-Bannerman's
personality may well account for the diffident nature of his letters,^54 but it
appears that he' found the Cabinet discussion tedious and discursive, and
[so] he could not manage to manufacture a lucid but specious account for
the King.'^55 Retrospectively, Hankey described these letters as less than
adequate, citing George V's experiences: 'He told me several times that
until he received the Cabinet Minutes and papers ... he had never been
fully informed of what was going on.'^56 Where the letters are relatively
full - Asquith's are much lengthier, but other sources (e.g., the Hothouse
Diaries) have shown them to be incomplete accounts of Cabinet
discussions - the premier's own interests or faulty recollection may
intrude. Although particular specimens of 'the Prime Minister's letter'
are interesting and useful, the genre communicates only a limited
understanding of the dynamic of nineteenth-century Cabinet
government.
And of course it served no useful purpose so far as the Cabinet itself was
concerned: the result of the lack of any official record had often been
either ignorance or confusion, comprising a pattern attested to by a wide
variety of ministerial frustrations. Certainly best known, and possibly
most telling, among a number of such incidents is the 1882 inquiry of
Lord Hartington's Secretary, directed to Gladstone's Private Secretary:
Harcourt and Chamberlain have both been here this morning and at my Chief
about yesterday's Cabinet proceedings. They cannot agree what occurred. There
must have been some decision, as Bright's resignation shows. My Chief has told
me to ask you what the devil was decided, for he be damned if he knows. Will you
ask Mr. G. in more conventional and less pungent terms?^57
The episode gave Philip Snowden cause to ponder practices which he had
experienced as a minister with the older approach which he could barely
comprehend:
Everyone who has experience of committee meetings where a large amount of
business is considered must know how difficult it is to remember precisely what
happened, and members of the committee in the absence of a record of the
proceedings carry away with them various impressions. By the time the next
meeting is held there are probably as many impressions of what was agreed to as
there were members of the committee present.^58
In the intervening half-century, other ministers had on occasion
lamented the difficulty of comprehending Cabinet deliberations under
such a handicap, a complaint forcefully registered by Lord Lansdowne,
who in 1900 had been distressed by the Prime Minister's claim of Cabinet


```
20 A man and an institution
```
support for his refusal to publish certain Foreign Office dispatches:' I was
quite unaware of any such decision but our decisions are very often
impalpable and perhaps I ought to have been able to construct one from
materials afforded by Devonshire's yawns, and casual interjections
around the table.'^59 Whatever the political cast of the ministry, such
incidents document a type of malpractice common to nineteenth-century
Cabinet government, namely the faulty administrative practices of
Cabinets sometimes unable to agree whether they had agreed on a given
issue. Lord Derby's restrained language of 1877 -' he understood that the
recollection of some of his colleagues was of a different character' - stands
as an early epitaph for a lack of system which, at its worst, precipitated
unjustified and unnecessary ministerial resignations.^60
Problems with the Cabinet's resolution of business persisted into the
midst of war, as Hankey discovered in one case where he had taken a CID
report on the treatment of aliens to the Cabinet, requesting immediate
attention; despite persistent inquiries, he had' never been able to discover
whether the Cabinet actually discussed the Report.'^61 He could not judge
by the results, because some of the CID's recommendations had been
carried out, others not; nor could he get anywhere with Asquith, and
attempted instead to turn the premier's flank by raising the question with
Balfour.^62 Earlier, Hankey had witnessed at a remove ministerial
misunderstanding and the imprecise execution of a Cabinet decision on
29 July 1914 to put into immediate operation measures deemed pre-
cautionary in view of the outbreak of war in Europe.^63 Flawed practices
continued to characterize Cabinet deliberations to the very last meeting
prior to Asquith's resignation; as the war ground on, Britain's margin of
tolerance for the foibles of nineteenth-century ways narrowed drastically.
Recognition of this basic deficiency moved Lord Curzon in 1918 to speak
of the old procedures with an air of incomprehension:
There was no agenda, there was no order of business. Any Minister requiring to
bring up a matter either of Departmental or of public importance had to seek the
permission of the Prime Minister to do so. No one else, broadly speaking, was
armed in advance. It was difficult for any Minister to secure an interstice in the
discussion in which he could place his own case. No record whatever was kept of
our proceedings, except the private and personal letter written by the Prime
Minister to the Sovereign, the contents of which, in any case, are never seen by
anybody else. The Cabinet often had the very haziest notion as to what its
decisions were.^64

What to do with Cabinet decisions posed another set of problems. An
errant minister could mislead his own department, which Hankey
vouched for in regard to pre-war Admiralty practices, as the First Lord
would 'write down his own Minute of the Cabinet decision on the appro-
priate office file, notifying the Office of whatever it was essential they
should know.'^65 According to the sole official inquiry concerning Cabinet


```
The origins of the Cabinet Secretariat 21
```
procedures from 1900 to 1916, such a regular practice - however subject
to misunderstanding - cannot be assumed for all departments: ' In the
absence of minutes of [Cabinet] meetings it seems to have been the
practice for Ministers to record Cabinet decisions on the appropriate
Departmental file, although sometimes the fact that the decision was a
Cabinet decision might not be mentioned. On other occasions they no
doubt gave their substance orally to their officials.'^66 In other cases,
ministers might not recognize the implications which a particular
decision might have for their departments.
With such practices, the possibilities for disagreement were manifold:
to guard against such misunderstanding, on one occasion a minister
secured a formal record of the Cabinet's assent to a number of proposals
which he had brought forward against considerable opposition. In this
strange episode, the Secretary of State for War, Arnold-Forster, 'got
Austen Chamberlain to note down the eight decisions he had obtained, a
precaution he had learned from the aptitude of his colleagues to forget his
projects.'^67 How many of his colleagues derived the same lesson, in the
absence of an authoritative record? Apparently there was no need to
disguise the practice of note-taking, at least in the Asquith administ-
ration: a new minister noted in his diary that at his very first Cabinet
meeting a colleague 'took copious notes of the proceedings.'^68

In his charge as Secretary to the War Cabinet, Hankey was expected to
draft an authoritative record of Cabinet proceedings. While a radical
departure from traditional Cabinet procedures, such a practice had
important institutional antecedents: the nature of these secretarial tasks
did not differ substantially from those he had acquired while serving in
the Secretariat to the Committee of Imperial Defence. That record-
keeping body, in existence since 1904, had been adapted during the war to
serve the needs of the several war committees. Although such techniques
as invitations to meetings, agendas, and minutes can be traced back to a
predecessor body, a Cabinet Defence Committee established in 1895
carried out its charge for seven years, although little is known of its
efforts, because, as a Cabinet committee, it kept no records.^69 In the wake
of the Boer War, two criticisms were laid against its performance: one
concerned its inadequate use of intelligence sources; the other, its
inability to serve the ends of defence planning, namely:' how to settle the
broad principles of national and imperial defence upon the basis of
information from all the interested Departments, and then to lay down,
again in principle, the size and composition of the military and naval
forces necessary in peace to make such a defence policy.'^70 Such a
criticism reflected a flaw in the Defence Committee's original charge, as
its founders had assumed that such a measure of inter-departmental co-


```

```
operation and co-ordination could be secured without an agreed-upon
record of planning and in the absence of any kind of permanent stafif
officials; the assumption reflected the style of nineteenth-century
government.
Complaints voiced from within the Defence Committee in 1900
pointed to the relationship between the lack of minutes and the failure to
apprehend decisions, but these were fended off by the service depart-
ments on the grounds that regular organizational mechanisms would turn
the committee into a 'Court of Revision.' The Admiralty and the War
Office resisted such surveillance of their work by other Cabinet mem-
bers.^71 Paradoxically, the impetus for the institution of a stronger
committee came two years later from the service ministers; but in this
case a new First Lord of the Admiralty had concluded that were such a
committee to produce convincing evidence that a larger Navy was needed
for the defence of the Empire, ' he would have an irrefutable case for
asking for enough money to build it.'^72 After initial reservations, the
Prime Minister, A. J. Balfour, agreed to the reconstitution of the
committee, and a re-organized Committee of Imperial Defence emerged
in late 1902; it differed from its predecessor in its regular meetings and
limited membership - the Prime Minister, the First Lord, the Secretary
of State for War, and their four military advisers, which met at the
premier's summons and as his own committee. In such a fashion the CID
circumvented ' the established conventions of Cabinet secrecy which, at
their worst, made unbusinesslike methods inevitable.'^73 The CID was
given a part-time clerk from the Foreign Office stafif to keep a record of its
proceedings, but his activities were limited to clerking.^74 The product of
his efforts, the CID conclusions were sent to the King commencing in
March 1903.^75
Pressures for more formal structure of CID activities came from the
report on military re-organization returned by the Esher Committee in
December of that year; they recommended the appointment of a civilian
secretary and a full-time stafif to consider all aspects of national and
imperial defence on a continuing basis. Esher personally hoped to
strengthen the CID as a 'department under the Prime Minister' which
would serve as ac Great General Stafif' for the Empire.^76 In May 1904 the
Prime Minister sanctioned the creation of such a department with the
organization, bearing the less grandiose title of 'Secretariat.'^77 Such a
staff was intended to provide continuity in defence planning regardless
of the political composition of the government, amounting in one sense to
insurance taken out against a Liberal regime, although phrased circum-
spectly in the Esher report: 'It is not safe to trust matters affecting
national security to the chance of a favourable combination of personal
characteristics.'^78 In sum, the re-organization of 1902 and the strengthen-

###### While Balfour insisted that the CID was an advisory body, its existence

1911.^83 A Liberal War Secretary, Haldane, reported that 'the CID never
touches policy. It ascertains facts and supplies technical information.'^84
In the context of strategic planning, the CID failed to resolve - as had
been the case with the Defence Committee - the basic dilemma of British
pre-war defence planning, 'the conflict between capability and policy.'^85
The Committee of Imperial Defence lacked the institutional strength to
undertake such an over-riding co-ordination of defence planning: in that
sense, its failure was determined by the departmentalism inherent in the
political dynamic of the nineteenth-century Cabinet.
On the other hand, the CID's positive achievements, especially the
collection of what Haldane called 'technical information,' ought not be
discounted, because that information contributed to Britain's war
readiness: paramount among the CID's contributions was the assembling
of the War Book, prepared in 1911-13. It detailed and collated
departmental plans for a 'Precautionary Stage' when the outbreak of
hostilities seemed likely, specifying actions to be taken by departments at
that time in the first stages of war; given the departmentalism of the old
order, there is no doubt that the War Book provided the means by which
HMG moved with some semblance of lock-step into war in August 1914.
In after years, Hankey viewed the preparation of the War Book as his
greatest achievement.^86 Yet in the event Asquith's inherent disrespect for
planning of any sort was evident in his decision to throw open Britain's
projected military role in France and the Low Countries to rival
strategists, at two extraordinary gatherings of soldiers and statesmen at
the very outset of war; possibly only French reliance on these long-
established plans prevented what has been fairly called 'a spate of
improvisation.'^87 Improvisation was at the core of the traditional Cabinet
system, and the method had carried Britain far, but it was unable to
sustain her in the First World War.
Improvisation of a sort is apparent in the fact that the CID had planned
no role for itself in war: ideas ranged from Haldane's design to transform
the committee from an advisory body into the center of an executive
control to Esher's resolve that' in war its doors should be closed: yes, at
the very first shot.'^88 Whether or not caught between two such extreme
views, the CID had not foreseen how the war effort should be directed,
which has been viewed as 'a catastrophic oversight.'^89 Yet one must
question whether ' oversight' is the proper term, given the fierce pre-war
departmentalism of the War Office and Admiralty: Asquith certainly held
no brief for a co-ordinating agency, and the CID - the Prime Minister's
own committee - was in no position to project itself as a war directorate-
in-waiting.^90 Though the CID studied specific war plans in the last
months of 1914, its limited co-ordinating functions had already passed to


```
The origins of the Cabinet Secretariat 25
```
the War Council, a partly advisory, partly executive body which served
Asquith's style well. The CID Secretariat had been placed at the disposal
of the War Council, and Hankey brought to that body a secretarial
apparatus which went without challenge at the sub-Cabinet level. Yet the
Cabinet war committees were unable to secure overall direction of the
war effort along the lines of a 'supreme command.' Through the end of
1916, and even into the last year of the war, the government proposed as
they might; the military by and large disposed as they pleased.
In this setting, accounts of the 'failure' of the CID exaggerate the
possibilities open to the ministers who sat upon it and the officials who
staffed it.^91 The deficiency lay instead in governmental organization,
which indulged the excessive departmentalism which permitted the
service ministries to go their own ways. Esher's 1904 re-organization
aimed to secure a measure of control over the services, exercised by a
Prime Minister's department in the hands of a senior military planner:
Sir George Clarke, later Lord Syndenham, attempted to play such a role,
but he was frustrated under Unionist and Liberal regimes alike; Clarke's
hopes to preside over a ' Department of National Defence' had vanished
before he stepped down in 1907. His immediate successor, Admiral
Charles Ottley, accepted the limitation of purpose with the position.^92
Thus with Hankey's succession in 1912 the 'raking in' of technical work
for the CID, which functioned as 'an inter-departmental catch all,'
amounted to a recognition of what was possible.^93 As a relatively junior
officer, Hankey thought it essential not to injure the extant relationship
between the services and the CID: where men such as Esher, Balfour, and
Clarke had been unable to create an independent status for the
Committee of Imperial Defence, Hankey did well to work within the
limitations posed by prevailing political attitudes and an ascendant
departmentalism.
Thus Hankey built, as in a fashion Ottley had before him, where
realities permitted: the CID discharged its technical tasks with an
undoubted competence which was not exactly the hallmark of pre-war
government; in particular, its secretarial techniques had been tested and
sharpened with the passage of a decade. The Cabinet Secretariat
possessed a useful institutional antecedent: to be sure, the CID did not
function as' the centre of strategic planning' prior to the Great War,^94 but
it did provide an important precedent for the updating of Cabinet
government in the midst of war. Along with the wealth of experience and
range of acquaintances which Hankey acquired in his CID service, the
new Secretary shared in its carefully nurtured non-partisan status. Esher
played a role in the committee's deliberations under Unionist and Liberal
governments, but most of the credit for keeping CID activities at a
remove from partisan politics is owed to A. J. Balfour, who joined in the


26 A man and an institution

work of one of its sub-committees while a leading Opposition figure.^95
Hankey's own training in the Royal Marines had included a keen
interest in Intelligence, which helped to qualify him for service at the
CID; the attitude of political neutrality acquired there Hankey sub-
sequently cultivated in the Cabinet Secretariat, although Hankey's own
neutrality proved less than absolute. Already known to Admiral Fisher
through his years in the Mediterranean Fleet, Hankey owed his initial
CID appointment to Admiral Charles Ottley, who five years later worked
with Fisher to secure the Secretary's post for Hankey.^96 At that time
Hankey had not shied from lobbying on his own behalf, showing the same
detailed preparation which was to characterize his secretarial labors.
Haldane had been asked to interview the candidates, and he pressed
Hankey on the question of his age and relatively junior rank; according to
Hankey, he replied to the War Secretary that 'at my age he was a Q. C.
and a leading member of the English bar (!) (having looked the matter up
in Who's Who), and I said that so far as I knew there was no other
profession (including politics) where a man of 35 would be held too young
for a high position.'^97 His gambit successful, Hankey's appointment was
generally well-received, although he lacked the reputation which Clarke
and Ottley, to a lesser extent, had brought to the post.^98 There is little
question that Hankey made his mark upon the ministers with whom he
came into contact: Asquith did not hesitate to name him Secretary to the
War Council, formed in November 1914. Yet Hankey was not perceived
as a threat in military quarters, in part because the CID had in no
significant fashion transgressed upon the military's strategic concerns;
nonetheless, Hankey had won the soldiers' respect and gained their
confidence.^99

So too did David Lloyd George have good reason to turn to Hankey to
help organize what the new premier viewed as ' virtually a new system of
Government in this Country.'^100 To secure that reform, the first session
of the War Cabinet sanctioned 'the advisability of strengthening the
secretariat of the former war committee by the addition of a civil side.'^101
Hankey walked away from that historic meeting - the first 'outsider' to
attend a Cabinet meeting to maintain a record of its proceedings^102 - with
a massive task at hand. If Sir Edward Carson accurately depicted their
mood, the members of the War Cabinet derived a great deal of satisfaction
from that meeting; Carson told the editor of The Times that' they had got
through more work at the Cabinet on Saturday in seven hours than in all
the time he had been a member of it before.'^103 Several months later,
Carson expanded on his initial reaction:

in the first instance the absence of collective control by a Cabinet of the heads of
the great departments had led to confusion, but [he] said that a system of control


```
The origins of the Cabinet Secretariat 27
```
had been developed which was now working extremely well and was, for war
purposes, incomparably better than the old Cabinet system, though he admitted
that after the war, we should have to go back to a Cabinet system, but the Cabinet
should be much smaller - 12 or 14.^104
One senses that Carson thought the old Cabinet far too discursive - hence
the success of the smaller version; yet it was also the tendency to duplicate
discussion in war committee and full Cabinet which the new ' system of
control' had been devised to correct.
What was the basis for that system? Clearly it took its point of
departure from Hankey's proposed' Draft Rules of Procedure,' drawn up
for the War Cabinet and subsequently discussed by that body. To
facilitate the War Cabinet's conduct of business, the Secretariat was
charged with these functions:
(1) to record the proceedings of the War Cabinet;
(2) to transmit relevant extracts from the minutes to departments concerned
with implementing them or otherwise interested;
(3) to prepare the agenda paper, and to arrange the attendance of ministers not in
the War Cabinet and others required to be present for discussion of
particular items on the agenda;
(4) to receive papers from departments and circulate them to the War Cabinet
and others as necessary;
(5) to attend to the correspondence and general secretarial work of the Office.^105
The record-keeping function is clear, but the communication of decisions
is every bit as important; as well, the reverse flow of information to the War
Cabinet was provided for. Another crucial fact of information-gathering
was secured through the appearance before the War Cabinet of ministers
and military leaders; in this regard Carson provided a contemporary
impression of how the new system functioned:
On the Agenda paper (of some 15 items) there was a rough time-table as an
indication to the ministers and others concerned of the time when their presence
might be required, though of course the indication was far from precise and,
though the War Cabinet worked very hard (straight on from about 1130 to about
7:30 daily), they could not depend on getting through the whole of the agenda.
The persons notified to attend varied from 3 to 4 to about a dozen and generally
included the head of more than one of the great departments as well as permanent
officials or officers of the services and experts.
The whole arrangement appeared to be effective and businesslike, but I [C. P.
Scott, Carson's interlocuter] remarked that it appeared to place the great officers
of State in an extremely subordinate position. Carson did not altogether dispute
this, but said that on the other hand it relieved them of unnecessary attendances
and enabled them to get on with the work each of his own department far more
efficiently, particularly having regard to the vast increase of public business owing
to the war and to the constant multiplication of departments since the war.^106
To strengthen the Secretariat's personnel, the War Cabinet approved,
on 18 December, the appointments of four Assistant Secretaries: G. M.


28 A man and an institution

Young transferred from the Board of Education; Thomas Jones, for the
rest of his life a confidant of the great and their satraps, was posted with
Young to the civilian side; Captain Clement Jones and Temporary
Captain L. C. Amery, MP, were added to the military staff which was
largely carried over from the Secretariat of the late War Committee.^107
Hankey expressed particular enthusiasm for Young's appointment and
voiced no concern about those of the two Jones' - both Welsh - but he was
less than pleased with Amery's posting; he acquiesced -' as Lord Milner
insists' - but explained to Lloyd George ' I always suspect him of being
anti-Russian, and would much sooner see him elsewhere.'^108 It is likely
that he feared Amery's close connection to The Times and possibly his
Milnerite view of the dominions,^109 but the Cabinet Secretary certainly
recognized the political nature of these initial appointments.
That of Thomas Jones was to prove the most influential in contributing
to the institutional development of the Cabinet Secretariat, since he
subsequently became Deputy Secretary, holding that post until his
retirement in 1930. With the singular exception of Hankey, no man saw
more from the inside of the operations of the Cabinet during these years,
and, like the Cabinet Secretary, Jones recorded detailed observations in a
diary. The records of the two men afford a unique view of the operation of
the new system of Cabinet government. Jones stood on peculiar footing
from the first, possessing what he described as ' the privilege of direct
access [to Lloyd George] whenever I sought it,'^110 in addition to
functional responsibilities within the Secretariat. His first interview with
his superior established Jones' style: 'I... talked over the sort of work I
might do. L. G. had spoken to him. I explained that I didn't want to touch
office machinery but rather to act as a fluid person moving about among
people who mattered and keeping the P. M. on the right path so far as
possible. He quite understood.'^111 From his privileged position Jones
noted his first impressions of his colleagues: he found Young, the future
historian of Victorian England,' very much the super-Oxonian and also
very ambitious and secretive,' yet the potential rivalry dissipated when
Jones received from Hankey functional responsibilities - for Food,
Drink, Coal Mines, the Disabled, Propaganda and the study of enemy
and neutral countries - which did not overlap with Young's; Jones
carefully kept his distance from Amery, 'a politician and a pressman.'^112
In such an orthodox fashion Jones entered an organization where
rumor had him 'a disguised Bolshevik whom Lloyd George had
discovered somewhere in a Welsh coalpit'; in fact Hankey had been
warned that the former academic was ca peace-monger and a syndical-
ist.'^113 However, Hankey took an immediate liking to the man 'despite
rather a sly face like LI. G.'s and I think I could use him on the industrial
side.'^114 Any account of the relationship between the two men, which was
professional rather than personal, must recognize that their interests were


```
The origins of the Cabinet Secretariat 29
```
complementary, Hankey on the military side and Jones on the civil; nor
did the Cabinet Secretary ever attempt to deny Jones the latitude which
the premier had given him.^115 For his part, Jones observed, with the other
Assistant Secretaries, Hankey's insistence that their liaison functions
should not interfere with department work:' It is of the utmost importance
that the responsibility of the Departments should be in no way weakened
or over-ridden by the development of the Secretariat... [which] is
neither an Intelligence Department nor a General Staff, but a machine for
the service of the War Cabinet in co-ordinating the action of the
responsible Departments.'^116 Yet the staff of the office did bring
information to bear upon War Cabinet discussion, through their
individual dealings with its five members.^117
The Assistant Secretaries played a collective role within the office, as
Jones noted in February 1917:

We are also rather in a flux as to methods of working the Secretariat. This last
week we are on a rota, each acting as Editor [of the Cabinet records] for the day.
This means being responsible for preparations the day before, a full day at No. 10,
and a third cleaning up... In addition we help the Editor and attend No. 10 when
our own special subjects come up. The work is greatly increased by the
uncertainty of the P. M.'s demands; agendas are suddenly scrapped, a meeting
called for the afternoon or evening, usually at 5 o'clock. Subjects it was hoped to
discuss are not reached and have to be fitted in to a later agenda, etc. etc. Some of
the changes are, of course, inevitable because caused by changes in the war
position.^118
Obviously, the Secretariat experimented in order to improve the flow of
business, surely sharing - whatever the temporary setbacks - the
conviction voiced by Leo Amery to the Prime Minister of Australia that
secretarial techniques could overcome the failures of the old order:

We have in fact swept away altogether the old system which you saw working at
the very height of its inefficiency when you were over here of twenty-three
gentlemen assembling without any purpose and without any idea of what they
were going to talk about, and eventually dispersing for lunch without any idea of
what they had really discussed or decided, and certainly without any recollection
on either point three months later. Under the new system the Cabinet has definite
agenda; there are no speeches but only short, business-like discussions between
the four or five Cabinet Ministers or professional experts brought in for the
discussion; full Minutes are taken, more particularly of the actual decisions
arrived at; these are circulated the same day and unless they are corrected by one
of the Cabinet Ministers concerned, the Secretariat assumes that the decisions
hold good and makes it its business to see that the Departments are informed of
the decisions and carry them out.^119
Amery marveled at the results of such orderly proceedings: 'The output
of energy on the part of the new Cabinet is amazing... What is more, at
each meeting some, and not infrequently quite a large number of
decisions were arrived at.'
Yet for all the change in methods, the war policy of the British


30 A man and an institution

```
government did not much alter. Changes in military leadership were
particularly difficult to achieve: not until the spring of 1918 was Lloyd
George able to replace the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, 'Wully'
Robertson, and even then he dared not move against the commander of
the British Expeditionary Force, Sir Douglas Haig.^120 As a result, the war
of deadly attrition persisted in France and Flanders. Nor could the
military orientation of the Cabinet Secretariat ease the acrimonious
relationship between the executive and the military authorities in the
formulation and execution of war policy. Though the divisive struggle
between war committees and the Cabinet had been ended, the debilitat-
ing conflict of politicians and soldiers persisted: in fact, relations between
the 'frocks' and the 'brasshats' deteriorated throughout 1917. In some
quarters, this problem has been viewed as institutional, as the War
Cabinet failed to include any representative of the service departments
and could not bridge the differences between the soldiers and the
politicians.^121 Much of the same type of criticism is expressed in the
assertion that the War Cabinet lacked 'a steady, continuous stream of
authoritative advice. '^122 Yet the Secretary of State for War, the First Lord
of the Admiralty and their senior officers were in frequent attendance at
Cabinet meetings; the flow of information to the War Cabinet was steady.
What frustrated the military was that despite their advice the War
Cabinet proved less committed to the 'Westerner' approach of Robert-
son and Haig than the service ministers; in that sense, the War Cabinet
questioned the' continuous stream of authoritative advice.' As early as 26
December 1916 Hankey touched the core of the problem: 'The new War
Cabinet are really up against it, as they don't believe in Robertson's
"Western Front" policy, but they will never find soldiers to carry out
their "Salonica" policy.'^123 The difficulty in reconciling soldiers and
statesmen was not institutional, but strategic- and political. As the leader
of a Coalition government, Lloyd George lacked the political power
directly to confront and reject the military advice which was approved by
many of his Tory supporters. Thus the military went their own strategic
way until the Prime Minister, intent on out-flanking his service advisers,
dared to cry 'Halt!' That moment did not come until the spring of 1918,
and even then the Prime Minister knew better than to shout the word to
his coalition. Institutional innovation could not serve to reconcile the
'frocks' and the 'brasshats.'
To return to the Secretariat's work, Amery's appointment illustrates
an important political dimension of the reforms of 1916, namely the
arrival in Whitehall of a band of young, able, and aggressive men who for
more than a decade had looked to the lead of Lord Milner, now a member
of the War Cabinet.^124 The long years in the political wilderness had
ended dramatically, and the Milnerites, ' serene in their conviction that
```

```

```
they were better equipped than their fellows to serve the State/^125 strove
to seize places in the new regime. Initially, Hankey feared a Milnerite
coup within the office, as two members of the War Cabinet joined with
Milner in recommending that Arthur Steel-Maitland should be offered
'the Civil Secretaryship as an equal colleague of Hankey.'^126 The Cabinet
Secretary lost no time in approaching Lloyd George, who scuttled the
scheme, although Hankey assured him that his objection was to the
'tactless' figure of Steel-Maitland rather than the development of the
civil side of the Secretariat.^127 Yet only two days later he informed his
wife, 'I am aiming at remaining the sole Secretary.'^128 Having bested
Milner's attempt, Hankey proved accommodating in the case of Amery's
appointment as an Assistant Secretary, for all the fact that he distrusted
Amery's motivations and even a month later referred to his subordinate
as a 'scheming little devil.'^129 In short order, Hankey came to appreciate
Amery's abilities and interest in imperial affairs, and the two worked well
together until the latter assumed similar secretarial labors with the
Supreme War Council at Versailles a year later; although the two differed
concerning Amery's 'independent' role at Versailles, the Milnerite
proved a loyal colleague.^130 Nor, in a wider compass, did Hankey have any
quarrel with Milner's professed aloofness from party politics. 'My
interests do not run on the lines of Party & if I can help, in however small a
way, to carry out the objects I have at heart, I do not care two straws how
the politicians are labelled who execute them,'^131 Milner had written in
1893; Hankey, and Lloyd George too, had been pressed to share such
sentiments a quarter-century later.
At first Hankey had envisaged a functional division of responsibilities
within the Secretariat, drawn along lines of machinery - the process of
record-keeping - and what was described as ' ideas'; the civil side of the
office had been strengthened to serve these purposes. After discussion
with each member of the War Cabinet, Hankey advanced the' ideas' side
as one which would supplement rather than replace departmental
initiatives: 'the War Cabinet, composed of selected Ministers without
Portfolios, is in a position to view every question from a wider point of
view, and to formulate ideas far beyond the probable scope of any
Minister engaged in the task of administering a great Government
Department.'^132 However, the concept of a collective 'ideas' operation
within the Secretariat was short-lived, and the organizational pattern of
the Secretariat divided instead along other lines: a military branch was
headed by an experienced Secretariat hand, E. D. Swinton, and the civil
side first under Young and subsequently Thomas Jones.^133 The War Cabi-
net Rules of Procedure specified no' ideas' function for its own Secretariat
Instead, such ' ideas' as emerged were to be collected and discussed
within the Prime Minister's Secretariat, an entirely new organization

However, the contemporary impression ran to the contrary, and the co-
operation between the two bodies added a Milnerite hue to the Cabinet
Secretariat, despite Hankey's efforts to steer clear of political groupings
in whatever garb.^141 As the months passed, Hankey grew increasingly
discomfited by the activities of the Prime Minister's Secretariat,^142 but it
must be added that his own inclusion in a secretarial capacity within
British delegations which discussed Allied foreign policy added to the
functional overlap between the two bodies. Even more basic was Lord
Milner's close connections with the two Secretariats, which served to
compound the confusion - at a time when 'Milnerism' was nearly as
suspect in Liberal circles as the forces of the Kaiser himself. Until
recently, historians had not generally differentiated sufficiently between
the two operations; evidence of the actual influence of the 'Garden
Suburb' is finally in hand, and its war-time activities have been clarified:
its irregular status and ad hoc pursuits are confirmed; the myth of a
Milnerite monolith operating in the gardens of No. 10 has been dispelled;
and the individual contributions of its leading members carefully
evaluated.^143 While 'influence' is difficult to measure, the time for
confusing the two operations^144 surely is now past.
Physically, the two were quite distinct: the temporary quarters of the
one stand in marked contrast to the Cabinet Secretariat's quarters across
Whitehall, in what were by common assent beautiful Regency-style
houses next to Montagu House; this cul-de-sac, Whitehall Gardens,
where Peel and later Disraeli had lived, has lamentably vanished from
the London scene.^145 The Committee of Imperial Defence had been
quartered in No. 2, as the government had taken over the site in the early
years of the century; with Hankey's new responsibilities, he received
from Lloyd George a free hand to commandeer the houses on either side,
which had been recently used by the Ministry of Munitions. In early
1917, upon his return from an Allied conference in Rome which the
Prime Minister had attended, Hankey discovered that the office was in a
state of' terrible congestion' because the necessary renovations had not
yet been accomplished;^146 the Secretariat's facilities mirrored the general
confusion from which the new regime attempted to forge order. Still,
Hankey reveled in the comfortable spacious houses and their setting,
separated from the Embankment and the Thames by long gardens
planted with rows of trees: 'With its central situation, close to the
principal Government offices, its quiet, and the peep of the river with its
endless traffic of small craft there was no pleasanter spot for an office in
the whole of London.'^147 History was present in these buildings: Disraeli
had lived in No. 2 between 1874 and 1878, and Hankey's operations were
based where Cabinet meetings - without benefit of records - had been
held in May 1875.^148 Now the intimate record of the British Cabinet's role


###### 34 A man and an institution

###### through the Great War and beyond, nearly to the renewal of hostilities

###### twenty-one years later, was kept in Whitehall Gardens.

###### In what form were those records to be maintained? Who was to benefit

###### from access to them? Neither basic question was settled with the

###### establishment of the Cabinet Secretariat, but Hankey and his staff strove

###### for answers which would make the new system an effective means of

###### government, while at the same time protecting the integrity of War

###### Cabinet proceedings. Although the records of the Committee of Imperial

###### Defence represented a precedent of sorts, there the pattern of record-

###### keeping had changed considerably over a decade. In its first years,

###### relatively sparse records served primarily to preclude future govern-

###### ments from closing down defence planning through ignorance alone.^149

###### In the years to the outbreak of the war, with the introduction of the

##### Secretariat and a full-time staff, the CID minutes gradually became

###### fuller, until Hankey's hand on occasion recorded near-verbatim proceed-

###### ings.^150 Despite this change, there was no formal repeal of the secretarial

###### precepts laid down in 1903 for the 'part-timer who did not pretend to

###### know the job':^151

###### It was agreed that no attempt should be made in the Minutes to summarize the

###### conclusions of the Committee or to record the arguments used during the

###### discussions. The Minutes should only mention the points actually discussed; the

###### conclusions being eventually summed up in the reasoned Memorandum which

###### would be left to place on record, for future reference, the decision arrived at.^152

###### Rule and practice had diverged, as rather full records had taken the place

###### When war came, the precedent of maintaining records in matters of

###### sought to balance his belief in the collective responsibility of the Cabinet

###### with the need for executive planning of the war effort: three successive

###### committees of the Cabinet assumed the latter task. None succeeded as an

###### executive body, in large measure because the Prime Minister reserved to

###### the Cabinet the effective control of war policy. These committees

###### nonetheless assumed the functions of the pre-war CID and its Secretariat

###### assumed committee responsibility, and, according to Hankey's account,

###### they were determined upon more efficient practices:

###### The Dardanelles Committee... [May-November 1915] was itself in theory a

##### Cabinet Committee, and held its first meeting without a Secretary. But Asquith,

###### Balfour, Kitchener and Lloyd George insisted on a Secretary, and I was brought

###### in and succeeded in gradually infiltrating it with the Chiefs of Staff and all the

###### procedure of the CID.^153

Hankey attended these committee meetings to take manuscript notes
from which decisions were extracted and circulated to the departments,
although the right of appeal reserved for Cabinet discussion of conten-
tious matters repeatedly compromised the committees' effectiveness.
The minutes and papers preserved for the three committees provide an
adequate record of their deliberations, and once again the scope of the
minutes gradually widened; for example, there exists a great deal of
relevant information concerned with the Gallipoli expedition.^154 The
value of these records was underscored for Lloyd George when he began
to gather documentation for his assault upon Asquith's war leadership.
At his behest, Hankey collected a record of everything which Lloyd
George had said at meetings of the three committees; thus armed, the
War Secretary had records in hand when he attacked ' the military policy
of our advisors' in the final, traumatic meeting of the War Committee on
1 December 1916.^155 When Lloyd George asked Hankey to prepare
Cabinet Minutes for the new government, they were meant to com-
municate decisions to the departments, but as the months passed, a
widening in their contents took place. The Prime Minister's own desire
for fuller minutes may well provide the explanation, because on several
occasions he had protested incomplete or misleading minutes of the War
Committee; Hankey had then only been able to protest that his minutes
were substantiated by 'a very full Secretary's note of everything that had
occurred,' which was available for his examination.^156 It is not likely that
Hankey forgot his difficulties, and, whether by inference or direction
from the premier, concluded that fuller minutes would be a wiser and
more acceptable course in the Lloyd George administration.
Verbatim minutes, however, presented substantial difficulties: Hankey
did not use a shorthand technique, although he utilized a form of
'shortened longhand' in compiling his rough record of proceedings,
upon which he based the actual Cabinet Minutes.^157 The process enabled
him to clarify the issues and to refine the actual language of the final
form.^158 Certainly the 'shortened longhand' which he used was vital to
the accuracy of his minutes, but other factors contributed to his style:
from his CID experiences he learned ' the art of drafting a formula which
would satisfy both parties to a dispute.'^159 And many of his acquaintances
testify as well to his ' incredible memory,'^160 which surely could be put to
short-term use in drafting minutes no less than over the long haul as
custodian of records. Yet the pressures for a full record persisted,
particularly in certain quarters.
In August 1917 a heated protest from Lord Curzon occasioned a
resolution of the matter in a manner which proved decisive for the format
of Cabinet Minutes. The irascible peer expressed concern bordering on
outrage that his views on the proposed establishment of an Imperial War
Museum had not been made a matter of record; while Hankey's minutes


36 A man and an institution

```
attributed views to ministers outside the War Cabinet, there was no sign
that he had even spoken! Hankey replied in a reflective vein:
The system of record of Cabinet Minutes has always been a matter of great
difficulty to me from the very first day that the War Cabinet was inaugurated. I
remember that I raised the question at the very outset. Some Ministers were in
favour of no record of arguments at all and merely a bald statement of the
Conclusions. There was a good deal of feeling against recording the views of
individual members of the Cabinet unless they definitely expressed dissent with a
Conclusion. I remember that it was pointed out that the decisions of the Cabinet
had to be regarded as the collective decision of its Members, even if some had
expressed contrary opinions in the discussion, and that, for this reason, it was
undesirable to bring out the individual views of Members.^161
A year later, Hankey reiterated this concern for the doctrine of collective
responsibility: 'Broadly speaking ... I aim not at giving an accurate
account of what everyone said, but a general synopsis of the expert
evidence upon which the Conclusion was based, and a general summary
of the arguments for and against the decision taken.' The Cabinet
Secretary added that such a procedure enabled him to reconstruct the
rationale upon which the Cabinet had based its decision, which obviated
the need for a proces verbal.^162 However, Hankey acknowledged one
exception to the precept that the views of individual War Cabinet
ministers ought not be recorded: if he spoke upon a certain topic as an
expert - he gave the diplomatic example of Curzon on India - then his
views were recorded. To prepare a proces verbal, he maintained, would
cause him to' lose the grip on the form and the style of the Minutes which
I do my utmost to maintain.'^163
The Cabinet Secretary pointed as well to the use of the minutes as the
means of informing the head of a concerned department of the War
Cabinet's decision. Thus a concise resume of the arguments which lead to
a decision served important informational needs, but fuller minutes
would reveal the individual positions of War Cabinet ministers and could
lead to invidious pressures emanating from the departments; in contrast,
the resume protected the Cabinet's collective responsibility and elim-
inated any susceptibility to individual posturing for the record.^164 In this
exercise - valuable for the light shed upon Hankey's constructing the
records - the Cabinet Secretary obscured the office's suspicion that
Curzon may well himself have been the real problem. Several months
earlier, Amery had bluntly characterized Curzon's concern with the
Cabinet Minutes: 'He was in a fearful state to begin with because he
didn't figure sufficiently in the proceedings. He asked me if I had a
personal down on him ... He has a very comic side.'^165 Confronted by
Hankey's full explanation, Curzon yielded, although not without one
further egotistical outburst.^166 Yet as had been the case with CID
Minutes, so too with Cabinet Minutes, because fuller accounts of
```

###### The origins of the Cabinet Secretariat 37

```
deliberations became more common;^167 such a trend may have reflected
Hankey's increasing confidence in his mastery over the minutes; on one
occasion, confidence ran to excess, because he recorded proceedings of a
crucial War Cabinet gathering, despite instructions to the contrary,
'because they had been on the verge of such important conclusions.'^168
In dealing with Curzon, Hankey had underscored the direct use of
Cabinet Minutes in the execution of policy by the departments; thus he
had to clarify deliberations which sometimes made an unambiguous
decision difficult to discern. In this regard his own talents were brought to
bear, according to the description of a post-war Cabinet Office associate,
Frederick Leith-Ross:
```
```
He had an uncanny instinct for extracting a decision out of a Cabinet dicussion.
However inconclusive it might have been, Hankey was able to jot down at the
meeting and subsequently elaborate a conclusion which often had not been
expressed in so many words by anyone at the meeting but which was accepted
afterwards as representing the outcome of the decision. On one occasion the
Chancellor, coming out of the Cabinet, was asked by his Private Secretary what
decision had been reached on some item on the agenda.' I really couldn't tell,' he
replied, 'you'll have to wait for Hankey's minute.'^169
```
Another significant aspect of directing unambiguous information to the
departments was the question of access to the Cabinet Minutes, because
most ministers, including the heads of the great departments, were
outside the circle of the War Cabinet. While the creation of the small War
Cabinet settled the problem of divided responsibility which had felled
Asquith's government, communication of information had also
suffered.^170 Under the new regime, the War Cabinet required much
departmental information, which had to flow in the reverse direction as
well; hence the provision of relevant extracts to the departments which
were responsible for taking action or were otherwise concerned.
In a more comprehensive fashion, Hankey sent copies of the final draft
minutes of the War Cabinet, approved and initialed by the Prime
Minister, to its members and to the King, and they received printed
copies a day or two later. George V was made privy to far more
information than ever he had received before, although his Private
Secretary expressed the hope that 'the Prime Minister will adhere to the
time-honoured custom of reporting in his own hand the conduct of actual
Cabinet business, as such reports are the sole record of the proceedings of
a Cabinet meeting.' Hankey suggested to Lloyd George that Buckingham
Palace make do with the Cabinet Minutes, explaining:' Personally I hate
"time honoured" customs that waste time.'^171 The Prime Minister,
whose distaste for written correspondence was lengendary among family
and friends,^172 had no troubles in terminating the 'Prime Minister's
letter' forthwith. Even on the day that the Treaty of Versailles was


38 A man and an institution

signed, Lloyd George was reluctant to put pen to paper to inform the
King; although he did so, the premier ' didn't really see why he should
write the letter, or where the King came into the matter.'^173 If this
experience set a precedent, Cabinet Minutes had rendered obsolete all
but the most ceremonial correspondence between monarch and leading
minister.
Complete copies of the printed minutes were sent as well to the
Secretaries of State for Foreign Affairs, the Colonies, India and War, the
First Lord of the Admiralty, the Minister of Blockade, and the President
of the Board of Trade; subsequently, the Minister of Munitions and the
Minister of Information were added, as was Dr Christopher Addison,
oddly 'in his personal capacity.' Both the First Sea Lord and the CIGS
received printed copies, Hankey noted,' as so much of the business of the
War Cabinet concerns them that the system of sending extracts was not
found suitable.'^174 Beyond deciding which extracts should go to which
departments - 'a much more difficult duty than would appear at first
sight' - the Cabinet Secretariat had to administer a system for the
circulation of full sets which evolved in an ad hoc, even ad hominem,
basis. One further complication was mandated by security concerns:
minutes for about 150 War Cabinet meetings or portions thereof were not
printed in the usual fashion but instead were given a much more
restricted circulation in typescript.^175
Circulation of Cabinet papers -' the memoranda which were circulated
to members of the Cabinet to provide the basis of discussion or to give
information'^176 - stood as no innovation, as such memoranda had long
been submitted to the Cabinet, albeit in an irregular fashion:

Foreign Office memoranda were probably circulated in the pouches or boxes
containing copies of Foreign Office prints; and it is likely that other Departments
were responsible for circulating their own papers, either in separate boxes or in
one circulating box. On occasion a memorandum might first be passed through
the Prime Minister's hands and circulated from 10 Downing Street.^177

Prior to 1916, Hankey recollected, 'no large portion of the Cabinet's
business was done on the basis of memoranda,' but from that time
forward, the Cabinet Secretariat supplied a mechanism both for distri-
bution and central retention of file copies. The standard distribution was
restricted - only the King, members of the War Cabinet, and Balfour, in
his role as 'elder statesman' rather than as Foreign Secretary, saw them
all - but distribution could be quite extensive, because the Secretary was
authorized to send particular papers to ministers not in the Cabinet, to
the military chiefs of staff and to permanent officials. As a result, routine
informational papers - reports from departments or committees, for
instance - acquired a wide and regular circulation; on the other hand,
memoranda intended to shape War Cabinet' policy' required evaluation


```
The origins of the Cabinet Secretariat 39
```
to determine an appropriate distribution. Hankey recognized that for
optimal performance 'the Heads of the great Departments... [should]
be in possession of all the necessary information to enable them to
safeguard interests committed to their trust.'^178 For that reason the
Cabinet Secretary disliked the invidious distinctions which his office was
compelled to draw concerning Cabinet papers, presenting an even more
difficult problem than the properly balanced circulation of extracts from
Cabinet Minutes.
From past experience Hankey had concluded that excessive secrecy
took its own toll on efficient government:

In matters of war plans, where the fate of the nation, the success of a campaign,
and the lives of our soldiers and sailors are at stake, no precautions for the
preservation of secrecy can be too great. But secrecy ought not to be carried to the
pitch where it interferes with the requisites for forming a balanced judgment or
with administrative efficiency... the whole machinery of government works
more smoothly if the political and professional heads of Government Depart-
ments are kept au com ant with decisions of policy which affect them, whether in
the first or second degree. Moreover, with proper precautions the risk of leakage is
infinitesimal.^179

Although it is unclear whether Hankey himself encouraged a gradual
widening of distribution or, alternatively, whether ministers pressed for
more information, in April 1918 slippage occurred and the Cabinet
Secretary informed his staff that' very serious mistakes' had been made in
connection with policy papers. In response, Hankey restricted the
authority to circulate a memorandum to ministers other than the select
few who received all such documents.^180 Later in the year, however, he
felt that the great problem was the undue restriction of the flow of
information to ministers outside the War Cabinet: in a draft circulated to
his Assistant Secretaries, he proposed to meet the informational needs by
sending all ministers of Cabinet rank the printed Cabinet Minutes; he
noted that the highly secret' A' minutes might have to be expanded but
he thought that would pose no problem. With as much irony as Hankey
permitted himself, he commented:' Surely, if Minutes are not too secret
to print they are not too secret to circulate to Ministers of Cabinet
rank.'^181
About Cabinet papers the Secretary felt much the same, except he
recognized that a more limited circulation of those papers dealing with
'naval, military and aerial operations... and diplomatic questions' was
required; all other memoranda he proposed to circulate to all ministers
who received the printed minutes. In such a fashion Hankey intended to
close the gap which had opened in the flow of information from the War
Cabinet to the departments. Yet he was frustrated in his hope, ironically
in this case, by his co-reformer, the Prime Minister, who objected to
Hankey's appeal to share more information with the Secretaries of State


40 A man and an institution

for the Colonies (1916-18), Walter Long, and for India (1917-22), Edwin
Montagu:

He replied that it was his responsibility and not Walter Long's to keep the
Dominions' Premiers informed. My rejoinder was that, even so, he ought
constitutionally to be advised by the S. of S. for the Colonies. He did not admit
this, but he asked me not to raise the question at present, because he did not trust
Montagu. This places me in a difficult position because I am always being
badgered by these people about not getting enough information.^182

In this instance is revealed the 'underside' of Lloyd George's use of the
new administrative arrangements to bolster his own standing vis-a-vis his
colleagues, even if he invoked constitutional proprieties. Yet Hankey two
days later added to the standardized distribution lists the names of Long,
'unless there is some very special reason to the contrary,' and Montagu,
whom he noted should receive a large proportion of the 'Special
Distribution' telegrams in question. With the impending termination of
hostilities, Hankey advised his Assistant Secretaries that 'the rule of the
Office in case of doubt is to distribute too widely rather than too
narrowly.'^183
The 'Special Distribution' telegrams, which came from the Foreign
Office, represented another source of information for the War Cabinet; it
appears as if Lloyd George's own interest in foreign policy predisposed
him to restrict the circulation of these telegrams - the operational
mechanism of foreign policy - but Hankey did not indulge the premier;
instead he secured an agreement from Sir Eric Drummond, Private
Secretary to the Foreign Minister, to distribute ' practically all the most
secret telegrams' as War Cabinet papers.^184 Telegrams and documents of
lesser importance were circulated even more widely, including copies
sent to the former premier, Asquith, at Lloyd George's request.^185 All in
all, the results were such that Walter Long, who had good reason to be
grateful to Hankey, commented on the superiority of the arrangements
made by the Secretariat to the older control exercised by the Foreign
Office: 'the Secretariat have overcome all sorts of difficulties and have
invariably managed their circulation with the most wonderful success.'^186
In such ways Hankey and his staff bridged the information gap which
threatened to divide the War Cabinet from the departments; to be sure,
the answer lay in mechanical devices, but such a solution served in
important ways to harness the government's war effort.

```
The control of the circulation of Cabinet and allied documents was but
one aspect of the greater problem faced by the new regime and
particularly by the Secretariat: how to preserve the secrecy of Cabinet
deliberations. In the old regime, there had been frequent breaches of
government secrecy, both from within and without. In 1889 HMG

secured legislation designed to protect official secrecy: according to A. J.
Balfour, the incident which provoked this ' important legal reform' dated
to 1878, when a resentful temporary Foreign Office clerk, Charles
Marvin, secured a windfall by memorizing the text of an Anglo-Russian
treaty, which he sold to a London newspaper, the Globe.^1 *^7 Although
Marvin's action proved not to be an offence at law, the government
moved to curtail the practice of newspapers transgressing official secrecy.
Viscount Sandon recorded that the Globe's editor had paid Marvin £40
for his feat of memory: 'It seems that Captain Armstrong has been
boasting at the Clubs that there is no confidential Paper which he cannot
buy - a sad affair - which we [the Disraeli government] must try to
stop.'^188 Yet it was not for another eleven years that the government
moved appropriate legislation. By that time the rationale was cast in
terms of espionage and treason: over two decades, only one prosecution
brought under the terms of the Official Secrets Act of 1889 dealt with a
matter other than military or naval secrets.^189
The only significant source of information about Cabinet business in
the pre-war period proved to be the ministers themselves, although the
press remained the recipient of such breaches of secrecy. Already in 1885
the situation was such that Lord Carlingford remarked that the Cabinet
'works in a glass house.' Gladstone himself had harsh words in Cabinet
'first about the "leakage" of the Cabinet which he said was a disgrace,
and of bad augury for future governments.'^190 A long succession of diaries
and memoirs which often draw upon Cabinet proceedings to which the
diarists were not themselves a party point to the persistence of such
disclosures, though few of them came to the attention of the public.
Another measure of ministerial misbehavior is the restriction of the flow
of Foreign Office telegrams by Sir Edward Grey, Foreign Secretary from
1905 to 1916; he hoped to circumvent the radical disputation of his
policies which appeared in the pages of the Manchester Guardian.^191
Surely he was confirmed in his secretiveness by the occasional instances
of leakage which mark the Asquith regime. Even the loquacious Asquith
occasionally was exasperated: 'The P. M. began by saying that Cabinet
Govt. was impossible if The Times was to be able to give a shorthand
report of all our proceedings and proposals as it had done yesterday.'^192
To be sure, the creation of a Secretariat could not directly prevent such
ministerial indiscretion, which reached alarming proportions in the war
period. While the problem eased somewhat with the withdrawal of
Asquith and his coterie from government - he and his Liberal colleagues
had exhibited an 'extraordinary freedom' in conveying confidential
information to families and friends^193 - methods mattered as well as
personnel: by insuring that concise, accurate information about Cabinet
decisions reached responsible departments, the Secretariat procedures


42 A man and an institution

discounted the premium on rumor and gossip in official circles.
Hankey knew that the custodians of Cabinet records had themselves to
remain beyond reproach in their custody of government secrets, and he
personally was described as ' the man of a million secrets' upon his death
in January 1963.^194 His staff too had to be kept up to the mark, because
some held that the Secretariat as an institution breached the secrecy of
Cabinet deliberations. In a sense that view is accurate, but conclusions
drawn from it by contemporaries were not. For example, R. L. Schuyler
contended in 1918: 'Under the new system, it has become necessary to
devise prompt and intimate communication between the Cabinet and the
officers of administration, who are now removed from it; and these in turn
have involved the virtual abandonment of secrecy.'^195 The assertion
misses the essential point: secrecy continued to cloak Cabinet discus-
sions; the addition of a Secretary did not undermine the freedom of
discussion nor the doctrine of collective responsibility. Decisions had
after all been communicated to the departments under the old regime,
admittedly in an imperfect fashion. Now Cabinet decisions were to be
rendered unequivocal and shared with the concerned departments.
There was no question of these decisions becoming public, unless HMG
chose to inform Parliament. Thus the Cabinet Secretariat had, in effect,
been charged with the custody of Cabinet secrecy. The casual approach
of the old regime no longer sufficed; system was required to preserve
secrecy and to make government effective.
Even prior to his becoming Cabinet Secretary, Hankey had protected
the inviolability of Cabinet discussions. In July 1916 he authored a
passionately argued memorandum opposing the publication of any
papers related to the ill-fated Dardanelles campaign, only to see Asquith
waver in the face of parliamentary pressures and agree to an official
inquiry. However, Hankey determined to protect the' Secretary's Notes'
which he had kept for the War Council, the committee responsible for the
controversial operation, rather than turn them over to the official inquiry
conducted by the Dardanelles Commission. Having secured Asquith's
instructions to refuse the request to examine these ' Notes' - as opposed
to the War Council Minutes - Hankey had nonetheless to withstand the
ire of the Commissioners, who had been given the power by the
government to compel the production of relevant documents. The
dilemma is an obvious one, and Hankey informed Asquith laconically
following his own testimony before that body that they had threatened to
put someone in the Tower -' whether this was serious, and whether it was
you, or me, or the War Committee, or the Cabinet, that was going to the
Tower, I did not gather.'^196 His position, supported by the War
Committee, was that the release of the ' Notes' would compromise the
collective responsibility of the War Council, a sub-Cabinet body, and its
```

```
The origins of the Cabinet Secretariat 43
```
successors; disclosure even to an official commission would ' hamper free
discussion at the War Committee in the future if its members were aware
that anything they said might, as it were, be used on some future occasion
as evidence against them.'^197 While endorsing Hankey's position, the War
Committee offered a compromise: the Chair of the Commission could be
given access to the ' Secretary's Notes' not as a matter of record but' so as
to satisfy himself that nothing had been held back.'^198 It was left to Lloyd
George's War Cabinet to sanction such an arrangement, which may be
viewed as a limited victory for the inviolability of certain Cabinet records
relating to actual committee discussions.
While Hankey's conduct impresses in its loyalty to the Asquith regime

- he presented the government's case, which involved weeks of prepar-
ation and days of what amounted to cross-examination by the Com-
missioners^199 - following upon the events of December 1916 Hankey
exhibited an over-riding institutional allegiance. After leaving office,
Asquith requested a copy of the self-same ' Secretary's Notes' of War
Council meetings, but Hankey only complied after receiving permis-
sion from the new premier, whom he assured that his predecessor's
interest was defensive.^200 Neither of the two was intent upon recrimi-
nation at this time, and thus the request did not divide them. Yet the
episode is instructive, because it shows Hankey acting as custodian of the
records of past Cabinets as well as the keeper of new and more
comprehensive records. In both cases, he was intent upon preserving the
collective responsibility of the Cabinet and its committees through the
administration of Cabinet secrecy. Surely he did not then foresee that
history would ultimately lay claim to these documents, when these
records would be used in ways which none of the founders of the new
    system could anticipate.
       Hankey's care-to maintain the secrecy of Cabinet deliberations was
marred, it appears, only twice during the war years. In mid-1917 Asquith
learned, by some means, that Foreign Secretary Balfour had expressed
displeasure with Lord NorthclifFe's appointment to ministerial rank. At
one point Lloyd George's suspicions about the source of this leak
centered on his Cabinet Secretary, whom he asked to withdraw along
with his assistants during War Cabinet discussion of a very secret item;
    Hankey took care to reassure the premier about his own role, even
accounting for his recent social movements: 'I am very jealous of the
honour of my Office, and the War Cabinet.' In a more practical vein,
Hankey added that he set himself' a very high standard in the matter of
reticence - never more so than on those occasions (twice only since you
came into office) when I run across the Asquiths.'^201 By a strange twist of
    irony, Hankey lapsed from grace in uttering an ill-advised word to the
Asquiths - even a word with Margot could be too much - in May 1918; his


```
44 ^ man and an institution
```
```
information was but a small part, and not a secret one, of an erroneous
report that the British might have to evacuate the Channel ports.^202 Yet
the incident, minor indeed, strengthened Hankey's recognition of the
precarious nature of his position:' I always lived on a knife edge, with an
abyss on either side... every day I was continually concerned in
questions of such delicacy that anytime I might make a false step and be
engulfed.'^203 Hankey's slip had been momentary, and it does not much
subtract from the basic probity - ' he has probably never said a foolish
thing in his life, betrayed a secret, made a tactless remark or spoken out of
turn'^204 - which reflected directly on the organization he headed.
In contrast to the Cabinet Secretary's public persona, Hankey's private
maintenance of a full, revealing, and opinionated diary of his activities is
at first glance surprising. Admittedly, he guarded his diary closely,
keeping it stoutly bound and locked; he never took it abroad and he even
discarded his original plan to use his wife, Adeline, as his amanuensis.^205
Instead he made his own entries in a careful hand, normally during free
moments in his Whitehall Gardens office, but often in a more summary
fashion over the weekend at his home. He opened his diary on 5 March
1915 with a rhetorical flourish, inscribing on the flyleaf of what proved to
be the first of four volumes:
```
```
For a long time I had felt that my association with many interesting people, and
my experiences as Secretary of the Committee of Imperial Defence ought not to
go entirely unrecorded. Now, as Secretary to the Prime Minister's War Council, I
find myself directly associated with the central policy of the great European war.
Though regretting that I have not commenced this diary earlier I have decided
that no further time should be lost, and that, so far as time permits, I will jot down
from time to time any incidents of historical, political, military or personal
interest with which I may be personally connected.^206
```
With the assumption of his even more vital post as Secretary to the War
Cabinet, Hankey did not hesitate to carry his diary forward to the new
regime. Nor did he doubt the propriety of his record of the Cabinet's
innermost secrets, in a fashion which - privately - exposed the useful
fiction incorporated in the doctrine of collective responsibility.
Though Hankey's activities were on one level antithetical, apparently
he reconciled his pursuits on the ground that all the Prime Ministers
whom he came to serve knew of and approved his keeping a diary. In
Asquith's time, the diary had served as a record at a time when records
were hard to come by, and possibly Asquith's approval came for that
reason.^207 Certainly Lloyd George was well aware of Hankey's use of his
diary as a supplement to the official records, and he expressed no
objection to Hankey's chronicle.^208 As for the diarist, it is clear that in a
psychological sense Hankey alleviated or relieved the manifold pressures
under which he labored: the occasionally brutal remarks, directed at

```
```
' frocks' and' brasshats' alike, enabled Hankey to deal equably with those
who were his ' masters' or those who far outranked him in the military
hierarchy, whatever their flaws. Examples of this means of releasing
tension abound in the diary, although there is no evidence that Hankey
himself was aware of this particular function.^209 His colleagues and
subordinates were never given access to the diary, but at some point in the
inter-war years Hankey decided upon the eventual publication of the
diary, 'after about fifty years.'^210 Following his retirement, Hankey
shared information which he culled from the diary with numerous
historians of the era; late in his life, he published memoirs, The Supreme
Command, 1914-1918, which drew heavily from the diary, although
largely devoid of the most critical and subjective judgments.^211 Only with
the extensive use of many full entries from the diary in Stephen Roskill's
biography, published between 1970 and 1974, did the full spectrum of his
insights and biases become clear; they have revealed as well a less
attractive feature of the diarist's personality, Hankey's overweening if
private vanity. His diary entries are replete with admiration for his own
largely undisclosed importance in the scheme of things. Such a charac-
teristic may be the well-spring of the diarist, but Hankey's self-
righteousness renders him a less appealing if rather more human figure
than the Cabinet Secretary who had ' probably never said a foolish thing
in his life.'
Since Hankey was ever interested in precedents which cloaked the
activities of his organization with what he viewed as historical legitimacy,
he would no doubt have welcomed - had he known - the sanction of the
record kept between 1880 and 1906 by a preeminent civil servant, Sir
Edward Walter Hamilton; in Gladstone's second ministry, Hamilton
served as a Private Secretary and for three years, Principal Private
Secretary, to the Prime Minister. The editor of Hamilton's diaries has
characterized them in words which fit Hankey's endeavor:
```
There are throughout the journal - but increasingly so with the passage of time
and the development of Hamilton as a civil servant and as a diarist - the astute
observations of one in a remarkable position to know men and events, with
wonderfully balanced powers of judgment, and possessed of the uncommon
perserverance needed to keep a journal alive.^212

The two diaries, however, are not analogous, because the duties and
activities of the two men differed markedly: Hamilton, for example, was
not privy to Cabinet deliberations, although on one occasion his presence
at a Cabinet meeting proved an exception to the traditional rule that no
'outsiders' were ever admitted.^213 More telling, Hamilton's viewpoint
was dependent almost entirely upon Gladstone, and he had not the range
of contacts and sources of information which Hankey possessed. Pre-


```
46 A man and an institution
```
cisely because his diary was by design less 'private' than Hankey's,
Hamilton's is a rather pale document in comparison.

Hankey's concern to keep the Cabinet Secretariat free from political
entanglements of any sort was well-judged, because there was good
reason to demarcate the institution from his own personal role as an
adviser and confidant to the British war leadership. Hankey had no
control over this latter role, which he had inherited from the Asquith
administration, when he had been asked ' to free himself as far as possible
from detailed work in order to give his attention more closely to the
higher policy of the war.'^214 Already by that time he had gained the
confidence of the ' frocks' from the abilities and tact which he had shown
in dealing with the Dardanelles operation and, even earlier, by his
mastery of the co-ordinated process whereby the departments moved to a
war footing, embodied in the War Book assembled by the CID in
1911-13.^215 There had been minor slippages in the meshing of those
gears, but Hankey had taken pride in 'pressing my last button'^216 and
seeing the completion of his efforts, and the Asquith Cabinet thereafter
viewed him as a vital cog in the war machinery.
As a strategist, Hankey had long offered an alternative to the stalemate
established on the Western Front; in a lengthy memorandum written on
Boxing Day 1914, he had argued for the partial withdrawal of British
forces in that theatre in order to force the issue at Constantinople, in
conjunction with Greece and Bulgaria. Although Roskill avoids the use of
the pejorative term 'Easterner' to describe his strategy - in essence a
maritime rather than continental approach - Hankey's memorandum he
describes as 'the inception of the Dardanelles venture.'^217 The CID
Secretary was among the first, in mid-March 1915, to sense the
' premonition of disaster' in Britain's execution of such a strategy, and
four months later Hankey was sent by the government to report on the
imbroglio.^218 At first the object of military suspicions, Hankey succeeded
in establishing clearly that 'he was anxious only to use his exceptional
talents for their good.'^219 When the expedition could not be spared -
Hankey was among the last to advise against complete withdrawal from
the Gallipoli peninsula - Hankey escaped the stain which blotted the
records of nearly everyone connected to the venture; he had not, to be
sure, held a line command. Not even the role of' counsel for the defence'
which Hankey played on behalf of the Asquith government in the
proceedings of the Dardanelles Commission served to discredit Hankey,
or the advisory role which he played, in any important quarters. The
change in military command which brought Robertson and Haig,
convinced ' Westerners' both, to the fore did not appear to diminish his
offering constructive advice which was not without significance in the war


###### The origins of the Cabinet Secretariat 47

effort.^220 Even Haig, in a personal diary rooted in suspicion and steeped in
character assassination, expressed confidence in Hankey's friendship and
willingness to be of assistance throughout the war.^221
What helps to account for Hankey's ability to succeed in his advisory
capacity is the tact which enabled him to mask from the military leaders,
particularly on the Western Front, his deeply felt abhorrence of the
policies of those who led, in his savage diary comment, an' English Army
so rotten that it has never achieved one successful offensive in the whole
course of the war.' In May 1916, Hankey recorded his belief that 'the
Army want a regular orgy of slaughter this summer,' coupled with his
regret that the Asquith ministry had yielded, against their better
judgment, to the plan for another 'great offensive' conceived 'in the
heads of the red-hatted, brass-bound brigade... who know little of the
conditions at the actual front and are out of touch with real regimental
opinion.'^222 The Battle of the Somme rightly served to confirm in
Hankey's mind the accuracy of his view, and it caused him to question the
war leadership of Asquith, who had acquiesced in such unwise advice. At
no time could a man of Hankey's rank hope to contest the generals, save
by advocating a change in Britain's supreme command, as he did -finally

- in his conversation with David Lloyd George.
    In embracing the alternative of Lloyd George's leadership, Hankey
proved an indispensable institutional asset to the new regime. He
    continued to act as the secretary to the British delegation in a number of
Anglo-French and other Allied conferences held at London and on the
continent, providing records of those proceedings, as he did for the War
Cabinet. In his advisory role, he mediated between the soldiers and the
statesman, serving as an ill-defined but useful bridge between the two
camps: he never played that part to greater effect than in February 1917
when, anticipating difficulties at the Calais Conference - since the Prime
Minister sought to place Robertson, Haig, and the British Army under
the command of the French general Nivelle - he had prepared in advance
a compromise. In fact his suggestions resolved, if only temporarily, a
divisive public conflict, and he took credit for a 'great personal triumph'
in recording in his diary:

I tried to frighten him [Lloyd George] by the probable results of Robertson's and
Haig's impending resignation, and he was affected, though he swore he was not
going to be beaten over this. Then I warned him that he could not fight on the
basis of the outrageous French document and he agreed and asked me to draft
something on which he could fight. This was the psychological moment to pull
my formula out of my pocket. He read it, accepted it, sent for Robertson who
accepted it with intense relief and took it to Haig, who accepted it after palaver.
LI. G. then showed it to Briand, Lyautey and Nivelle, who accepted it. All
therefore was well ... all had been effected by my little scrap of paper.^223


```
48 A man and an institution
```
Hankey's mediative role involved foresight no less than tact in this case;
consistently he seemed able to gauge with a Bismarckian precision
politics as 'the art of the possible.' While he won plaudits for his roles at
the great war-time conferences, in peace-time his prominence began to
reap resentment for the Cabinet Secretariat. Yet the institution and the
man did not have to be differentiated as long as Lloyd George continued
in office.
In the meantime, the morass of indecision and inefficiency which
hampered the British war effort had in an administrative sense been
bypassed by the new secretarial arrangements. Yet the fitful, erratic
nature of Lloyd George's leadership led Hankey to record private
criticisms of the War Cabinet's occasional inability to discharge its
responsibilities in a businesslike fashion.^224 Witness to a number of
wasteful and unproductive meetings of Cabinet committees, Hankey saw
that adequate records could not always resolve inconclusive discussions.
In late 1917, he rued the lengthy discussions of a Cabinet Committee on
Manpower, chaired by the Prime Minister: ' They sat all that afternoon,
and all day Tuesday... but in orbits of much deviation, having covered a
lot of ground. On Tuesday evening, having come nowhere near a
conclusion, the P.M. turned to me and said "Now Mr. Secretary I think
you had better draft a report.. .". It was a desperate job.'^225 'Desperate
jobs' became the lot of the Secretariat, but even such tasks serve to
remind of the alternative, the attempt of Asquith's ministries to conduct
world war for nearly two and a half years without recourse to system in
general and a Secretariat in particular to tend to the flow of business. In
December 1916, Britain was fortunate that the new regime could draw
upon a decade of experience, at the sub-Cabinet level, in secretarial
techniques; no one can say what price the nation may have paid because
re-organization of Cabinet business had been so long delayed.
Gone were the scramble of Ministers to get their pet subjects discussed at Cabinet
meetings. Gone were the endless rambling discussions with no one to give a
decision. Gone was the exasperating waste of time while the affairs of a
department were discussed by people who knew little of the matter and had
received no Memoranda on the subject. Gone were the humiliating and
dangerous doubts of what the decision was, or whether there had been a decision
at all.^226
Hankey's own verdict rings true: the old Cabinet ways were doomed, long
after their time had run out.

## The Lloyd George regime

The fallen premier, H. H. Asquith, chose not to challenge in Parliament
what his successor described as 'the amalgamation of the old War
Committee with the Cabinet.' Nor did Asquith express more than his
regret that the new regime had abandoned what he described as 'the
inflexible unwritten rule of the Cabinet,' namely that the Prime Minister
alone took a record of Cabinet proceedings, for the sole purpose of
informing the King.^1 In the wake of political crisis, near-universal
approbation of the various administrative reforms followed; nor did the
establishment of a Cabinet Secretariat loom particularly large in the
redefinition of the relationship between Cabinet and Parliament, which
was so far-ranging that A.J.P. Taylor has commented that 'par-
liamentary government, as it had been known for the last century or so,
ceased to exist.'^2 Nonetheless, Parliament deferred to Lloyd George's
assurances, at least in part because Asquith tacitly acquiesced to the new
premier's statement:
There seems to be a little concern that the new organisation should have the effect
of lessening Parliamentary control. I wonder why on earth it should do that. Each
Minister answers for his Department exactly in the same way as under the old
system. Each Minister is accountable for his Department to Parliament, and the
Government as a whole are accountable to Parliament.^3
While the Opposition Front Bench remained quiet - they had failed to
win the war, after all - back-bench critics were not long in detecting a
bureaucratic threat to representative government: linking together the
two Secretariats they found' growing up round the War Cabinet a perfect
fungus growth of liaison officers and paid secretaries of one kind or
another.'^4
This initial parliamentary criticism echoed press attacks unleashed in
the columns of Massingham's The Nation, which in February 1917
denounced the imposition of a 'double screen of bureaucrats,' consist-

###### ing of the Cabinet Secretariat, 'almost a Ministry in itself,' and the

illuminati in the Prime Minister's own Secretariat; these bodies were
interposed between the War Cabinet and the heads of departments.
Lloyd George's system threatened parliamentary government and the
representative principle. Massingham had no difficulty in locating the
source of this assault upon traditional ways:

Reactionary Imperialism [read, Milnerism] has thus seized the whole body of
Liberal and democratic doctrine, and is making off with it under the cover of war

... the seat of power... is being distributed among thousands of office-stools in
the jerry-built homes of our new Constitution... Mr. George has used Toryism
to destroy Liberal ideas; but he has created a Monster which, for the moment,
dominates both. This is the new Bureaucracy which threatens to master England,
unless England decides in time to master it.^5

Other journalists accepted the need for improved management of the
affairs of state; the Treasury's general supervision, dating to Gladstone's
time, had fallen into abeyance. Yet Lloyd George, the New Statesman
suggested, had gone about re-organization in a mistaken way:

in creating his Secretariats Mr. Lloyd George has made the double mistake of
giving them too large a role and manning them with a personnel of insufficient
standing even for the role that they might have legitimately undertaken. Their
functions should not have been in any sense a substitute for those formerly
discharged by the Cabinet; they cannot do anything which efficiently replaces that
regular meeting and consultation between the responsible heads of the
Departments.^6

The comment itself represents a mistaken idea about the Cabinet
Secretariat's role, since it had been designed to secure the departmental
implementation of the decisions reached by the ' regular meeting and
consultation' now vested in the War Cabinet.
Much of the misunderstanding of the functions which Hankey
supervised was a product of the overlap between his office and that of the
Prime Minister's Secretariat, which he admitted was understandable;
however, he added that 'occasionally / was attacked for the Garden
Suburb's activities - it eventually became a joke between Philip [Kerr]
and myself that I was his "whipping boy," but it was a wry joke for me
because the War Cabinet Office was an object of suspicion.'^7 The Cabinet
Secretary himself supplied another source of confusion through his
attendance at meetings which shaped Allied war policy, which under-
scored his advisory capacity; it was no easy matter for press or Parliament
to differentiate his role from Kerr's, who in time became the guiding hand
of the counterpart Secretariat. Yet for all the political fervor of The
Nation's attack, it proved short-lived: not until March 1918 did the press
again question the impact of the new methods. By that time The
Spectator, which granted the need for re-organization of the Cabinet
system, regarded as unproved any contention that 'the new machine


```
The Lloyd George regime 51
```
has produced results greatly superior to those produced by the old.'^8
Such an assessment was not incorrect so far as the military situation was
concerned, because Lloyd George and the military leaders remained at
daggers drawn; Hankey continued to play a mediative role between
'frocks' and 'brasshats,' a thankless if necessary task.^9
Disappointment with the progress of the war effort contributed to a
questioning of the Lloyd George reforms, which in perspective ran
contrary to 'the Whig theory of British history,' a belief that the pattern
of Cabinet government which had operated in the Victorian period
represented the culmination of some fifteen hundred years of progress
towards representative government. As a result, 'the conventions and
practices of the late Victorian period were not considered as merely true
for that time, they were regarded as proper or normal. When further
changes occurred, they were noticed with reluctance and tended to be
regarded as departures from the norm.'^10 Departures from established
ways were justified by the exigencies of war, but the burden of proof
remained with the reformers, and the events of 1917 had not returned a
clear verdict. Yet few would deny the judgment of Hardinge, the crusty
but experienced Permanent Under-Secretary of the Foreign Office, that
the War Cabinet system stood as 'an improvement over the last
administration. It has its weak points, but anyhow decisions are taken.'^11
Such efficiency did not come easily, and for a time Hankey despaired
about the War Cabinet's performance; on 18 March he noted in his diary:

The War Cabinet has met every day this week, but is not working satisfactorily.
They never discuss the Agenda Paper at all - in fact they have not done so
properly for a fortnight. They invariably allow themselves to be side-tracked into
something else - often some parliamentary business, or else LI. George has an
intense longing to discuss something different... Consequently, all the work is
dreadfully congested - far worse than it ever was under the so-called' Wait & See'
Government. Another difficulty is that Lloyd George will not initial the
conclusions (without which they do not become operative), and will not give me a
reasonably free chance to act without them, so that all the business of the War
Cabinet gets in arrears, and the Departments, tired of waiting for their decisions,
get discontented. I have only got the work along at all this week by a wide
delegation of decisions to Committees, to which with some difficulty I persuaded
LI. G. to assent.^12
Grieved that ' Lloyd George's method of doing business is to discuss
every subject under the sun except what is on the agenda,' Hankey feared
that the premier's disposition would give the War Cabinet and its
Secretariat 'a bad reputation.'^13 Periodically the Cabinet Secretary
insisted that the War Cabinet clear its congested agenda, noting at the end
of May 1917: 'they set to work with a will and with the determination to
clear up all arrears in two days... They are all rather done up and I felt
rather cruel.'^14 For his part, Hankey preferred the delegation of specific


###### 52 A man and an institution

items in arrears to individual members of the War Cabinet, a system of his
own devising which yielded good results:' the War Cabinet were actually
```
###### abreast of their work. I felt like "pilgrim relieved of his burden" and as

###### elated as if we had won the war.'^15 From this time, Hankey maintained

###### close tabs on the pace of Cabinet business, acting forcefully to produce

decisions.^16

###### While the modus operandi of the War Cabinet and its Secretariat

###### evolved in a pragmatic fashion, Bonar Law assured the House of

###### Commons that the new system was functioning well.^17 The House of

###### Lords engaged in a fuller discussion of its effectiveness in June 1918: the

major issues were whether the War Cabinet ought to restrict itself to war

###### business and, as a corollary, whether orthodox Cabinet government

###### ought to be restored for all other purposes. The defenders of the new

###### system insisted, in Lord Lansdowne's words, that 'there can be no

###### question of going back to the old system of Cabinet government as we

knew it before the war.'^18 Further, Lord Curzon rejected the view that the

###### War Cabinet system was meant only for war: ' We never threw off our

###### shoulders the general responsibility of government. The Ministry were

called a War Cabinet because their main function is war, but the idea that

###### they were not held accountable for the administration of the vast number

###### of ideas that ordinarily rest upon the Government of this country never

###### entered our heads.' As he warmed to his cause, Curzon rode roughshod

###### over what was viewed as a delicate point: ' I doubt very much whether

###### there has ever been a war waged by this country in which the military

###### advisers of the Government have had a freer hand in the expression of

###### their views, or in which there has been more deference paid to their

###### opinion.' As for future prospects, Curzon foresaw that the business-like

###### procedures of the War Cabinet would long survive the war which had

###### occasioned them:' whether our work be good or bad... my own opinion

###### is that when the war is over and the history of this time is written, it may

###### be found that we have left a not inconsiderable mark upon the

###### constitutional development of this country.'^19 Curzon awarded Hankey

###### the major credit for 'the successful working of the system,' although he

did not acknowledge his own debt to the Cabinet Secretary for the success

###### of his speech! Hankey recorded in his diary that

on the evening of the 13th I went to coach Lord Curzon on a speech he is to make

###### ... in defence of the War Cabinet system. I was with him an hour and a half. At

the end he was most extra-ordinarily complimentary, and thanked me profusely,

###### expressing astonishment at the way in which I managed to have every subject at

my fingers ends. He said that, whatever happened to this or other governments,

###### and whatever happened to the war, I should be indispensable to every Prime

Minister.^20

###### While the diary entry served Hankey's ego, as well it suggests that the

###### partisans of the new ways recognized the debt owed to Hankey for his

```
efforts in that cause: a product of the Asquith regime, he was clearly
identified with the new.
```
The turn in the fortunes of war associated with the collapse of the
German ofifensive in the spring of 1918 brought to the fore the question of
the survival of the war-time reforms in government. The achievements of
the Cabinet Secretariat could not, however, be dissociated from Hankey's
variegated responsibilities during that conflict: his role had never been
one of mere clerk to his chief; rather he served as a trusted adviser to the
Prime Minister, but the military never begrudged him such influence. To
the contrary, Haig appealed to Hankey in 1919 in an attempt to secure
better terms for the Germans at the Paris Peace Conference; he judged
the Cabinet Secretary's intervention successful, noting in his diary that
'chief credit is due to General [sic] Hankey.'^21 In fact Hankey was no
better able than anyone else to stem the vindictive tide, but he did
recognize the key dilemma confronting the peacemakers:
For some time past I have felt a vague and indefinite uneasiness as to whether the
Peace Treaty was developing on sound lines of policy... On this exhausted,
depleted, crippled and reduced country [Germany] a prodigious indemnity is to
be imposed. That Germany ought by every law of justice to pay the penalty of her
crimes no reasonable man can deny. The question, however, is whether justice
and policy can run hand in hand in present conditions.^22

```
Throughout the war, Hankey had never feared to transmit ideas which
had contributed, on several occasions in important ways, to winning the
war.
Such a role dated to the Asquith regime, although Hankey most often
agreed on strategic matters with Churchill and Lloyd George. While it is
not particularly pleasant to recall that in February 1915 'Hankey
proposed (a) igniting German crops and (b) distributing a "blight" over
the crops,'^23 more to his credit is his role in the initial planning of a 'land
battleship,' known to posterity as the tank, and in the development of the
convoy system later in the war. Hankey's role in overcoming Admiralty
opposition to the convoy system has long been recognized as a major
contribution.^24 Despite these successes, Hankey thought that his CID
duties limited the scope of his innovation, as he confessed:' I was as keen
as mustard on the tank, but with my own overwhelming preoccupations
the extent to which I could push it [with the War Office] was limited.'^25
With the change of regimes, Hankey did not cease to advise on military
matters, but his other responsibilities as Cabinet Secretary became more
time-consuming; it is well to record the wear of the pace which he had to
set, as outlined in his diary:
```
Every day I work at the greatest pressure from 10 a.m. to 7:30 or 8 p.m. I am at
every Cabinet meeting. At present I have in addition the Committee on War
Policy, at which I am allowed to have no assistant secretary, with very heavy


```
54 A man and an institution
```
consequential work. Although I have decentralized much of the ordinary office
work to my assistants I still have to keep a fairly close watch on the work of the
War Cabinet, Agenda papers, Minutes &c &c. In addition I have members of the
War Cabinet and all the other Ministers stopping in all day and asking me to drop
in on them, nearly always to confer about some difficult point, or some great point
of policy. On these subjects also I have a vast correspondence. In order to keep up
to date I have to read an enormous number of telegrams, Memoranda, letters &c
every day and to see a great number of people from the different armies, military
attaches, diplomatists &c &c.^26

His burdens were great, but such constant informal conversations
strengthened Hankey's influence upon those in authority. General Sir
Henry Wilson, successor to Robertson as CIGS, may have exaggerated in
commenting in 1919, 'if you once lost hold of Hanky-Panky, you are
done, absolutely done,' for doubtless Hankey saw some of his advice -
including the 'Easterner' strategy - go unheeded; nonetheless the
process yielded an important result: 'in coming to regard Hankey as
indispensable, Ministers must have absorbed many of his views.'^27
Such was the respect Hankey gained that Lloyd George considered
appointing him Secretary of State for War, but Lord Milner - while
admitting that 'a great deal' might be written in Hankey's behalf -
managed to convey more in his own interest, and five days later he gained
the post.^28 Even earlier, Hankey refused to entertain the prospect of
becoming First Lord of the Admiralty, explaining that he would be' quite
hopeless as regards parliamentary matters, deputations, etc., in regard to
which I had no experience.'^29 Although Hankey's ministerial experience
was deferred to another war, his ministerial career does not put the lie to
such a self-assessment. With the conclusion of the First World War, his
name was mentioned as a possible successor to Hardinge at the Foreign
Office, but George V objected, on the grounds that his position at the
Cabinet Office was more important.^30 Even the mention of Hankey's
name in connection with such leading posts, political and civil service
alike, serves as testimony to his standing in the eyes of contemporaries.
His name also figured prominently in any discussion of those in-
dividuals who were most responsible for winning the war. In August
1918 the press magnate Lord Riddell secured the premier's agreement to
Hankey's strategic contribution:

```
Hankey is also entitled to a share, and a large share [Riddell claimed] of the credit
for the convoy system, which saved the nation. He had the idea and, in the face of
fierce opposition, continually urged its adoption.
```
```
L. G.: Yes, quite correct. For the moment I had forgotten. Hankey is one of the
great figures in the war.^31
The experienced elder statesman Balfour rated Hankey highly for his
able role in ensuring communications within the Lloyd George coalition;
```

The Lloyd George regime 55

for this and other reasons Balfour declared in after years: ' I tell you that
without Hankey we should not have won the war!'^32 According to
Hankey's own testimony, his Sovereign's praise was even more
pronounced:

He then reminded me that early in the war he had warned me that, if I confined
myself to my job, and avoided all temptation to make suggestions and get power
into my hands, I should be a great force in the war. He said I had followed his
advice, with the result that, in his opinion, I had done more than any other person
towards winning the war. He added that Lloyd George and Asquith had
independently said this.^33

While Hankey acknowledged that George V exhibited mistrust for Lloyd
George, it impresses as odd that he did not recognize that such a bias had
likely contributed to his own elevation in his monarch's eyes. It also
deserves recording that Lloyd George entered his own claim to a place of
primacy in winning the war, when in 1939 he acidly explained his own
exclusion from Neville Chamberlain's war coalition: 'Neville put
Hankey into the War Cabinet instead of me because he thought it was
Hankey who had won the war.'^34 One cannot begrudge the aged and
embittered figure his resentment, but even more to the point, Hankey
never questioned the towering contribution of David Lloyd George. Late
in his life, Hankey challenged the assertion that his erstwhile chief would
live on in history as the greatest of British war ministers, save only for Sir
Winston Churchill: cIf you take the war as a whole, including its
preparation, its course, the extent of the victory, and the condition in
which it left our country, our Empire, and the peace of the world, I
venture to say that Lloyd George comes out first and Churchill second.'^35
In more practical terms, with the termination of hostilities there arose
the matter of rewarding Hankey for his efforts, since sizeable grants were
awarded the military leaders. As post-war Secretary of State for War,
Churchill declared that' his brilliant services deserve exceptional recog-
nition,' and he suggested that Hankey be made a Privy Counsellor and
given a grant of £2O,ooo;^36 the Cabinet proved more generous, agreeing
upon a sum of £^2 5>ooo, 'without a dissentient voice,' the Cabinet
Secretary noted. Although he was troubled by Lloyd George's refusal to
accept anything whether from public funds or private subscription for his
services, Hankey felt that he could not afford to follow such an example,
describing himself as a 'poor man.' Although financial concern played a
part in his decision, it appears that on another level Hankey could not
bear the prospect of his service going unrewarded:' I did as much to win
the war as any of the Admirals and Generals. I have no doubt whatsoever
of this.' He then spelled out in his diary two pages of his war-time
achievements to bolster his deserving status.^37 That account, incident-
ally, reveals Hankey's own belief that his contributions were basically

two-fold, as the organizer of the new Cabinet system, and as military
adviser and ministerial confidant. Thus the fortunes of the Cabinet
Secretariat in its early years must be assessed in the totality of Hankey's
achievements: the institution cannot be severed from the man, because
the Cabinet Secretariat evolved in pace with Hankey's contribution.
When Curzon remarked in the House of Lords that the Cabinet Secretary
'had been more responsible than any other individual for what he
[Curzon] claimed to be the success of the system,' he had established that
inter-relationship.
In the course of the war, Hankey applied the procedures which were
established by the Cabinet Secretariat to other new bodies created to
improve and co-ordinate the war effort. Both the Imperial War Cabinet
and the allied Supreme War Council were served by mechanisms
modelled on the original Secretariat model.^38 Although there is no need to
explore the functions of these bodies, records of the proceedings of both
were handled along familiar lines, and Hankey personally sat to keep the
minutes of the former, which attached the dominion Prime Ministers
visiting London to the War Cabinet deliberations concerning imperial
matters. The British section of the Supreme War Council's Secretariat
was housed at Versailles and staffed largely by Army officers, but it
operated under the control of the War Cabinet Office.^39 Hankey's
methods of operation were taken up as well by the French and American
governments, the latter at the insistence of that keen observer Col.
House.^40 Thus the dissemination of practices based upon the Cabinet
Secretariat's procedures was widespread within the allied camp.
No one recognized more clearly than Hankey that the major work, and
indeed the success or failure, of the Cabinet Secretariat lay with the
performance of the War Cabinet. At the conclusion of the war, he spoke
along those lines to his staff:
We have recorded the decisions, we have been the link between the War Cabinet
which took the decisions and the Departments who were responsible for giving
effect to them. We have turned [sic] the machine up to the pitch, when, I am sure,
an absolute minimum of time has been occupied in translating these decisions into
actions... On the prompt transmission of these masses of orders the whole
success of the Government policy has again and again depended. You cannot lose
time in War.^41
He predicted that the secretarial system evolved to meet the needs of war
would survive to serve the nation's needs in peace, the settlement of
whose terms HMG now confronted. Dealing with Allied statesmen was
for Hankey nothing novel, even in the Asquith regime; now the War
Cabinet established an office in Paris, upon the opening of the peace
conference in January 1919; the Foreign Office and other departments
concerned with the peace negotiations also established missions.^42


```
The Lloyd George regime 57

```
Hankey served as Secretary to the British Empire Delegation, which
caused some consternation in the Foreign Office, although it seems that
Hardinge, the Permanent Under-Secretary, was not particularly troub-
led.^43 The tell-tale signs of the Hankey method were soon evident: never -
it would appear unqualified - did he fail to lay his hand upon a paper
required for some or other discussion; the utility of such readily
accessible records was established when Hankey alone got the tangled
affairs of Yap straightened away.^44 Whatever the failures of the Paris
proceedings, Hankey's 'methods of recording minutes, circulating
papers and dealing with other procedural and secretarial matters were
adapted by the international secretaries of this and later conferences.'^45
His own services were conspicuous in their absence: the glacial rate of
progress in the Council of Ten led to private negotiations among the
heads of government, although a stumbling block soon arose; Lord
Riddell offered an explanation - and a solution - to Lloyd George on 24
March 1919:
he ought to have Hanky-Panky with him. The trouble is that the four [heads of
government] meet together and think they have decided things, but there is no
one to record what they have done. The consequence is that misunderstandings
often arise and there is no definite account of their proceedings and nothing
happens.^46
Records for the Council of Four, formally constituted on 27 March, date
from that time, with Hankey's hand in evidence.
As Lloyd George's right-hand man, Hankey earned considerable
notice at Versailles; his advisory role was clear. Leo Amery has illustrated
the type of influence which the methodical Secretary exercised over the
mercurial premier, who was known to propose spontaneously some
particular policy which the British delegation had already decided to
oppose; Hankey would pass along a note which Lloyd George would
quickly assimilate, without a pause in his remarks.
```
Presently he would blandly explain that he thought he had done full justice to a
view which however the British Government did not share, and would now
expound our own real attitude. Meanwhile Hankey would draft a resolution
which Lloyd George would then read out as representing the fully considered
proposal which he had brought with him.^47
Hankey's impact upon the conference mechanism and the quality of his
advice to the premier account for the unusual accolade conferred by his
chief, who rarely took the time to write to those with whom he was in daily
contact:' Your work has been beyond the praise of words.'^48 Yet Hankey,
for all the fact that he had discharged duties which he described with a
touch of hyperbole as ' Secretary of the Cabinet of the World,' came away
from those proceedings disappointed: the final terms of the treaty
troubled him, as had the course of the negotiations. In fact, he resolved to


58 A man and an institution

turn down the post as Secretary General to the fledgling League of
Nations, because he doubted the strength and soundness of the League,
especially in regard to the Covenant's provisions for automatic sanctions,
which he thought mistaken.^49 Advice from the likes of Curzon and Esher
reinforced his own fears, and in April 1919 he refused to let his name go
forward, explaining that a number of developments had run contrary to
his expectations; among unsettled questions he cited what he had' always
regarded as an essential condition, namely the certainty of the acceptance
of the Covenant by the United States of America.'^50
In such a fashion Hankey opted against becoming the chief servant of
the new international order; instead, he remained on in London, buoyed
by his view that 'the British Empire is worth a thousand Leagues of
Nations.' Alas, the British Empire, like the League, was to fall upon
fallow days, and Hankey was to live to suffer the denouement at Suez.
Upon returning to Whitehall Gardens, the Cabinet Secretary entertained
hopes that the British Empire staff assembled at Versailles might be
transformed into a body serving the activities of a post-war Imperial War
Cabinet and leading to ' a real Imperial Cabinet Office' on a permanent
basis.^51 In his absence, the Cabinet Office had been ably run by his
deputy, Tom Jones, in a fashion that might be viewed as' on guard for the
Prime Minister.' At one point Churchill had attempted to settle the
principle of the continuance of compulsory military service in the War
Cabinet, before referring the matter to Lloyd George in Paris. Jones had
quickly informed Hankey, who had gone to the Prime Minister;
according to Hankey, Lloyd George was 'much annoyed about
Churchill's proposal and has written him to stop it' without mixing
Jones' name in.^52 Such plain dealing between Hankey and Jones eased the
Cabinet Secretary's initial suspicion that the deputy might covet his
position; though the two men were not personally close, there were no
signs of professional envy.^53

```
The activities of the Cabinet Secretariat and the role of the Cabinet
Secretary were known in any detail only to a few in the inner circles of
government. Some attention - whether or not welcome - had been
directed their way in press and Parliament, and official commentary had
been offered both in Parliament and in the innovative War Cabinet
Reports for 1917 and 1918, although the latter broke no new ground so far
as the Secretariat's activities were concerned; it noted that the major
administrative development of 1918 was the assumption of responsibility
by Cabinet committees in dealing 'with groups of questions which
previously had tended more and more to come within the range of
subjects dealt with by particular members of the War Cabinet.'^54 The
service of such committees, along with the co-ordination of government
```

business in order to ensure the maximum utilization of the country's
productive resources, had become major activities of the Secretariat, as
important as the keeping of the record of War Cabinet meetings.^55 The
War Cabinet Reports, which addressed these administrative practices,
were on one level' accounts of stewardship, setting out the administrative
work of the new government and concentrating on the new developments

###### and on constitutional innovations such as the War Cabinet itself.'^56 On

another level, the Reports were intended to advertise and promote the
government's efforts; probably for that reason, they were drawn up by the
Prime Minister's Secretariat, but there is evidence that a Cabinet
Secretariat functionary was so appalled by the lack of ' literacy' in the
draft that he had his subordinates rewrite it.^57 In any event, the Cabinet
Secretariat had nothing whatever to fear from the War Cabinet Reports.
The continued existence of the War Cabinet system of government was
called into question with the Armistice of November 1918: how long
could it remain intact when its purpose had been realized? Hankey had
labored to make the system function in war-time, because he had seen
that the traditional methods would not suffice; he became the 'task-
master ' of the new regime, striving to keep the War Cabinet on the mark.
On one occasion, in the Prime Minister's absence, Bonar Law had
proposed that the War Cabinet go no further in settling business:

I then spoke out and said I thought it my duty to warn the War Cabinet that their
work was badly in arrears; that many questions were awaiting decision; and that
there were at least three questions on the Agenda paper that they could settle
without the Prime Minister. This shamed them into continuing. But, by this
time, I found that Mr. Balfour, Lord Derby, Sir Eric Geddes and Adi. Jellicoe, all
of whom were concerned in these questions, had slipped out of the room. So I ran
out into the passage... and said ' look here, you must not blame me if your
department affairs at the Cabinet get in arrears. There are questions on the
Agenda which concern you all, and here you are all bolting off.' So they all filed
back, and we got a good deal of business done.^58

The Cabinet Secretary entertained no doubts about the value of the
system he had managed, but he foresaw several alternatives as far as the
configuration of the Cabinet in the post-war period was concerned: these
ranged from a large Cabinet of the pre-war type to a small Cabinet
composed mainly of ministers without portfolios, with several possibi-
lities between the two. Assuming that Lloyd George intended to propel' a
great scheme of reconstruction and social reform' with the energy
committed to winning the war, Hankey preferred the small Cabinet:

if efficiency only is taken into account, the War Cabinet system is by far the best.
One of the principal reasons for the success of the War Cabinet system was
undoubtedly the small number of persons with whom the final decision rested,
coupled with the elasticity which enabled the arbiters to hear all sides of the case.


60 A man and an institution

```
The moment the numbers become larger, and more particularly the moment the
Heads of Department become final judges on questions in which their Depart-
ments are interested, the power of decision will become weaker.^59
Hankey anticipated the objections which would be raised to what he
advised calling the ' Reconstruction Cabinet'; to meet these, he recom-
mended weekly or fortnightly meetings of all ministers to hear and
question the premier, and he advised full circulation of the Minutes of the
Cabinet and its committees.
Lloyd George himself had already intimated that ' in some form or
other he wants to keep the War Cabinet system after the war.'^60 To be
sure, he took political factors into account, and Esher spelled these out to
Hankey at the end of 1918:
Having broken up the Party system, it is childish to revert to a formula which was
the outcome of that system. This is bed rock. So is the deduction, that you must
let the principle of Evolution work freely: and without obstruction. The War
Cabinet - as you well know - was not a sudden inspiration but the natural
corrollary [sic] of a Committee within the Cabinet etc. dating from Gladstone's
time. If the P. M. goes back to the old inane system, he is done for.^61
Support for an extension of the new ways came from another quarter, as
the Milnerites strove to strengthen the imperial fabric, in the main by the
establishment of a post-war Imperial Cabinet every bit as important as its
domestic counterpart. Amery took the prospect of two distinct Cabinets
seriously, although his lengthy memorandum has all the flavor of a period
piece:
The Prime Minister should, in fact, be the only common link between the two
Cabinets, associating with himself, to prevent his being overloaded by the burden
of work, a trusted lieutenant on each side, in the one case the Dominions Minister,
in the other the Leader of the House of Commons. As far as possible the two
Cabinets should be kept clearly separated ... In this way a tradition against
dragging Imperial affairs into local party politics might very rapidly grow up ...
The whole aim, in fact ... is to attain as far as possible the clear separation of
Imperial and domestic policy.^62
Hankey was personally sympathetic to such a bifurcation, although he
informed Amery that despite his advocacy to Lloyd Geroge, the premier
had yet to commit himself. For that reason, the Cabinet Secretary
suggested a different approach: he' had suggested to L. G that if he wasn't
prepared to go as far as that, he should have a Cabinet of 22 or so and at
their first meeting inform them that he didn't intend to meet them as a
whole body but would formally divide them into Imperial and Domestic
Cabinets.'^63
Unwilling to contemplate the restoration of the old Cabinet system,
which simply could not sustain the pressures of contemporary govern-
ment, Amery agreed with Hankey the small Cabinet was much pre-
```

```
The Lloyd George regime 61
```
```
ferable. Yet his thoughts about the Secretariat did not echo Hankey's,
because Amery foresaw that
```
when ordinary party conditions return, this secretariat would become to some
extent a political body and include a certain number of young politicians who
were definitely put in to study administration and other problems from the point
of view of the policy of the party in power... the Prime Minister might delegate
the general control of the Home Cabinet secretariat to the Leader of the House of
Commons.
Such a step would involve the fusion of the distinct secretariats which
Lloyd George had established, and it gave every appearance of disengag-
ing from civil service principles. Despite this difference concerning the
Secretariat of the future, Hankey and Amery agreed that increasing the
numbers of departmental ministers within the post-war Cabinet gravely
increased the risk of inefficient and discursive government, reducing that
body to a rag-tag debating assembly. Perhaps both underestimated the
ability of the secretarial mechanism to cope with larger numbers in
Cabinet assembled, since peace-time Cabinets have generally included
twenty or so members; on the other hand, it is possible that the greater
numbers paradoxically enabled the Prime Minister to distance himself
from his Cabinet colleagues and to strengthen his role at their collective
expense.^64
In the meantime, Lloyd George managed to finesse the question of the
size and type of the post-war Cabinet. Ministerial changes within the
coalition brought the question to the fore in January 1919, but the Prime
Minister accepted a compromise, suggested by Bonar Law, which called
for the continuation of the War Cabinet for the duration of the Peace
Conference: Austen Chamberlain remained a member of that body in a
personal capacity, although he became Chancellor of the Exchequer at
this time.^65 The small War Cabinet gained another ten months' life, and
constitutional principles were wholly ignored; what had transpired has
been described accurately as 'the casual outcome of a compromise
adopted largely on personal grounds to meet a particular political
situation.'^66 The irregularity of the proceedings illustrated anew Lloyd
George's contempt for traditional ways, whether in peace or in war. Of
course the conclusion of the Paris Conference removed the last prop
buttressing the existence of the War Cabinet; political revolt ensued in
the House of Commons, where the government sustained a defeat. Bonar
Law immediately moved for adjournment,' the only possible course open
to us under the circumstances.'^67
When the Commons reassembled four days later, the Cabinet had been
re-structured along pre-war lines: the heads of the great departments of
state again graced the councils of the Cabinet, and the action of the
Commons symbolized the termination of its deference to the centralized


62 A man and an institution

executive incorporated in the War Cabinet model. The question of the
size of the Cabinet had been discussed on the 23rd of October by Lloyd
George, Bonar Law, Churchill, Walter Long, and Hankey; the quintet
was well aware that the Machinery of Government Committee had
recommended as optimum a range often to twelve members for the post-
war Cabinet, while acknowledging that' a rearrangement of the supreme
direction of the executive as it formerly [i.e., prior to 1916] existed has
been rendered necessary, not merely by the war itself, but by the prospect
after the war.'^68 Hankey judged that his own intervention had been
decisive in disregarding the 'optimum' size and instead reverting to a
figure of about twenty; his appeal for the larger number reflected a
political calculation that.with only a half-dozen Cabinet ministers 'all
those left out would be discontented, and the Coalition would be
weakened.' Nonetheless, the Cabinet Secretary recognized that his own
labors would be complicated:

Of course, impossible to write down conclusions only, because what actually
happens in a Cabinet of 20 is that someone drops a suggestion, later on someone
else reverts to it and perhaps amplifies it, and then it becomes the conclusion. No
one knows exactly what the conclusion is, and the Secretary only discovers it by
piecing together the bits.^69

```
No doubt it mattered more to Hankey that the Secretary was still
around 'to piece together the bits.' The Machinery of Government
Committee, chaired by Haldane, had favored the continuation of the
Cabinet Secretariat.^70 Thus its institutional survival came as no surprise,
and its peace-time functions were modeled directly on its war-time
activities, 'subject to the cessation of the extraneous war duty of
preparing reports on foreign and overseas matters.'^71 However, the
Haldane Committee had added a cautionary note concerning the role of
the Cabinet Secretary as an adviser to the Cabinet, suggesting in rather
labored terms that if that body were not considering executive actions,
' the participation of a Secretary in the proceedings is not put forward as
being applicable to meetings of this character.' Lloyd George honored no
such distinction for the whole of his premiership.
By inference, the Machinery of Government Committee had rejected a
more comprehensive scope proposed for the Cabinet Secretariat by Prof.
W. G. S. Adams of the Prime Minister's Secretariat, who thought the
former body should incorporate' a staff... particularly alive to the whole
trend of development, not only in the administration, but throughout the
country. It should be a very quick Intelligence Department... closely in
touch... with the whole field of foreign development, with the
progressive forms of administration in other countries.'^72 Consistently
resistant to 'intelligence' activities within his own bailiwick, Hankey had
kept his distance from the other Secretariat, even in testimony given to
```

```
The Lloyd George regime 63
```
the Haldane Committee.^73 Adams' proposal that a Prime Minister's staff
merge the activities of the two Secretariats did not find favour in the
Report of the Machinery of Government Committee, and the functional
distinction between the two bodies was preserved for the balance of
Lloyd George's premiership.^74 Thus Hankey's Secretariat had survived,
virtually intact, and without unwelcome additions; nor had Hankey's
own advisory role been compromised.
He had every reason to be satisfied with the ease with which his
operations had been adapted for peace-time purposes; subsequently he
saw in the events of October 1919 the formal confirmation that the
Secretariat afforded an essential means by which

the great mass of Cabinet business [could] be handled. Every day the Cabinet was
faced with novel and complicated problems arising out of the war, out of the peace
treaties, out of demobilisation, or out of the difficult industrial and labour
positions created during the war. Nearly all these problems were inter-
departmental in character.^75

Nonetheless, the question remained whether heads of departments
sitting in Cabinet could discharge both ministerial and Cabinet res-
ponsibilities. In this regard Frederick Leith-Ross contended that the
volume of Cabinet business forced ministers to rely more on their civil
servants, which altered the mode by which the Cabinet did its business;
his comments deserve recognition, as novel procedures confronted a
'traditional' Cabinet:
It has been claimed that this procedure, and the recording in the Cabinet minutes
of the decisions taken, made for a more orderly system of administration. It may
be so, but it also made the system much more complicated. The papers to be
circulated became longer and more frequent until often a Cabinet Minister would
receive a box containing enough reading matter to keep him busy for a week. So he
generally glanced through the papers and handed over to his private secretary
anything that did not interest him specially. The private secretary would pass the
papers on to the department and obtain their comments and these eventually
came back to the Minister. They related mostly to details of the proposal, but the
Minister usually felt bound to raise any of them that seemed to him relevant. So
the Cabinet tended to get immersed in discussions of detail which took up too
much time. In order to relieve the pressure on the Cabinet, therefore, the papers
were referred to an inter-departmental committee of officials, whose duty it was to
sift out the various proposals or counter-proposals put forward and if possible
arrive at an agreed recommendation for the Cabinet. Thus there was a
proliferation of committees.^76
Such a complication may well have been the price which Cabinet
government paid for moving from an ' age of hum-bug to an age of hum-
drum.'^77
When Bonar Law informed the Commons about the continuance of the
Cabinet Secretariat, his announcement encountered some parliamentary
criticism. In response to a query concerning the presence of a Secretary


###### 64 A man and an institution

compromising Cabinet secrecy, the Prime Minister intervened to brush
the point aside: 'The secretary to the Cabinet is trusted in precisely the
same way as the secretary of the Committee of Imperial Defence was
trusted in the past.'^78 Interestingly, Hankey recognized that such 'trust'
left him freer than the Oath of the Privy Counsellor, as he had not after all
been given that status:

It seems to have been decided not to make me a Privy Counsellor ... Of course I
shall respect this confidence, in or out of office, so long as is necessary for the
safety of the country, or for the stability of the Government, but I do not regard
myself or my heirs to be bound by an oath that I have never been asked to take, and
my memoirs will be the more interesting for my not having taken the Privy
Counsellor's Oath. Otherwise I am not sure that I should feel free to keep this
diary.^79

To be sure, Hankey did not mask his keeping a diary, which he had used
in his governmental activities: proof of his openness is contained in a
letter informing the Prime Minister that he could not settle the latter's
query by the Cabinet records; nonetheless, Hankey continued, a par-
ticular interpretation 'is confirmed by the following extract from my
private diary for May 22nd 1918,' quoting some twelve lines in the
process.^80
Press reaction generally favored the reversion to the 'traditional'
Cabinet, although The Spectator thought that such a modification as the
Secretariat had been justified:' all we ask is that there shall be no Spenlow
and Jorkins business between the Cabinet and the Secretariat. It will not
do for the Cabinet to say they have been misled by the Secretariat or that
the Secretariat has acted beyond its authority. The Secretariat must be
the intelligent servant of the Cabinet, but the Cabinet must always be
responsible.'^81 Such advice represented a reasonable cautionary note, as
the enlarged body of customary size undertook collective responsibility
for the spectrum of government business.

Among the first items on the agenda, the new Cabinet took up a ' Set of
Instructions to the Secretary of the Cabinet,' which they discussed,
amended and approved at a meeting on 4 November; no ' Spenlow and
Jorkins' relationship could ensue if these regulations were observed.
Some deviation from war-time practices is evident: thus the Secretary
was instructed to keep a record of Cabinet proceedings, 'confined to
conclusions similar to those circulated recently in connection with the
War Cabinet discussions.'^82 In this connection, Hankey was convinced
that the minutes had become ' inordinately long' during his absence in
Paris and had recently made strenuous efforts to shorten them.^83 As if to
underscore the purpose of the record, in August 1919 the description
' Minutes' no longer stood at its head;' Conclusions' had taken its place.^84


```
The Lloyd George regime 65
```
The Cabinet Secretary recognized full well the difficulty of separating
' Conclusions' from the give-and-take of Cabinet discussion:' As a matter
of fact I work the whole of the important points of the discussion into the
Conclusion... Churchill attacked me for taking full notes the other day,
and I had to explain to him, but I told him I would destroy my pencil
notes, which is now being done.'^85 As well, his own burden was increased,
because from October 1919 Hankey was no longer permitted to keep an
Assistant Secretary in the Cabinet room - though the practice soon
revived. The reason seemingly lay in a desire to demarcate the Secretary's
unique institutional responsibility: 'The Secretary thus, besides being
the Permanent head of the Office, has direct personal responsibility to the
Prime Minister for all arrangements connected with the Meetings of the
Cabinet... [including] Minutes of Meetings &c.'^86
During the war, Hankey had relied on a relay system among his
assistants, with each responsible for a particular item in his turn:
Lawrence Burgis began a long association with the office in January 1918,
and late in his life he recalled the helping hand that Hankey had extended
to him when he was faced with his first minute:

it was my job to record their discussion and, afterwards, turn my notes into a
minute. My first scribbles made no sense at all, but when my time came to depart
and another Assistant Secretary took my place, Hankey beckoned me to him and
handed me a sheet of paper on which, in his spidery handwriting, was a record of
the discussion and the decision arrived at. He said 'this might help you.'^87

Although Hankey would appear to be in need of aid given the reversion of
the Cabinet to its pre-war size, he was left on his own, facing a task which
the Tory minister Walter Long viewed as daunting in the best of
circumstances: 'I don't know,' he had remarked to Burgis, 'how you
make any sort of record with all that talk going on.' At the same time, the
Cabinet decided upon a change in format for the Conclusions, which
were no longer to be printed but instead reproduced in typescript.
Perhaps this was an economy, but there had been another kind of problem
as recently as February, when Tom Jones had reported to Hankey: 'we
have stopped printing the Minutes for a few days until these lightning
strikes are over as I got a hint from the F.O. that some of the men were
Trade Unionists first and citizens afterward.'^88 Fewer hands were
involved with typewritten Conclusions.
The secrecy of Cabinet proceedings was served by the circulation of
complete copies only to the King, the Prime Minister and the Leader of
the House of Lords. Although the monarch may well have preferred a
resumption of the Prime Minister's letters, Hankey demonstrated that
George V had been fully informed by the new procedures.^89 Whatever
wistful visions may have preoccupied Buckingham Palace, traditional
ways were not about to be revived because of the War Cabinet's demise.


66 A man and an institution

Specific conclusions were sent to concerned departments, which were
accountable for their implementation.^90 Such a pattern derived directly
from war-time practices, although at that time a larger number had
received full sets; other ministers had received extracts, in some cases for
' Action,' in others for' Concern,' and in some instances ' For information
only.'^91 In contrast to the record of proceedings, all memoranda and other
documents prepared for the Cabinet were to be circulated to the Cabinet,
unless the Prime Minister ruled to the contrary. Hankey had sought such
a wider circulation in the last months of the war, and he was now given
discretion to circulate some documents to ministers outside the Cabinet
and to Permanent Secretaries. However, certain Cabinet papers regarded
as 'exceptionally secret' were to be circulated under 'Lock and Key'
procedures:

only one copy is sent to each Cabinet Minister, and the issue, without express
sanction, of duplicate copies is forbidden. Moreover, the copies themselves are
sent in sealed envelopes addressed to the respective recipients; these envelopes
bearing the printed instruction 'To be opened only by the person to whom
addressed.' These envelopes are in turn placed in 'red boxes' and then
circulated.^92

In other procedural matters, the Cabinet decided that records of
Cabinet committees ' shall as a rule be kept on the same principles as are
laid down for Cabinet records'; normally they were circulated to all
Cabinet members. However, in the case of one important committee,
Home Affairs, full minutes soon became the norm, serving a useful
purpose attested to by Austen Chamberlain in 1922:

I am accustomed to look through the conclusions of the Home Affairs Committee
and not infrequently to read the discussion in order to elucidate one or the other of
those conclusions. The rather full Minutes of this Committee, which constantly
deals with proposed legislation, are useful to me in considering the business of the
House and they are, of course, the only source of information which the Cabinet
as a whole possesses of the doings of a Committee which is almost a Cabinet
within a Cabinet... I think that some little indication of the arguments leading
up to these conclusions is in this case necessary.^93

In sum, the Cabinet Secretariat continued its ways following the
government re-organization of 1919: in short order, Hankey even
prevailed - likely upon the Prime Minister - in securing assistance at
Cabinet meetings; on a dozen occasions between March and July 1920 he
was accompanied by Thomas Jones, and Jones, in Hankey's absence, had
an Assistant Secretary helping. Not until Lloyd George's fall from power
in 1922 did a single Secretary chronicle Cabinet business.^94 Jones
confessed his pleasure in another device which facilitated the premier's
control of government business: 'We also have what we call Conferences
of Ministers when it is not desired to bother the Cabinet as a whole. To


```
The Lloyd George regime 67
```
these Conferences Ministers are invited according as they are likely to be
interested in the subject of the Agenda. It is a convenient device, some
would suggest, for excluding Ministers!'^95 Yet another mechanism which
strengthened the premier's hand in dealing with his colleagues was the
control of the Agenda, which could be used to ensure Cabinet disposition
of items which he wished settled, or - as important - avoided.^96 More
troubling for Hankey's staff was the need to determine the distribution of
the Conclusions, a burden which the Secretary remarked upon in 1922:
'The selection of these Departments [to receive extracts] was a matter
which required, in the case of every separate Conclusion, the most careful
consideration on the part of myself and my principal Assistants.'^97
In another aspect of the procedures, Hankey had not gotten his way in
1919: he was baulked in his quest for stricter long-term custody of
Cabinet secrecy, hoping to recover in the Cabinet Office the minutes and
papers circulated on behalf of the Cabinet. To that end, the draft
' Instructions' which he had surely drawn up had stipulated that' Cabinet
Minutes and Papers are not the personal property of members'; the
Secretary was charged with regaining custody in the event of the
resignation or death of a minister. Yet the Cabinet deleted this provision;
hardly disinterested parties, they held that secrecy was ' safeguarded by
the rule that no-one is entitled to make public use of Cabinet documents
without the permission of the King.'^98 In effect, the Cabinet provided
their own files for future reference. Hankey did not indicate whether he
was concerned with the possible publication of such materials, as a result
of the inclusion of several such documents in the memoirs of Field-
Marshal Lord French, 1914 - published earlier in the year; his stated
concern was instead the regathering of all Cabinet papers in order to
protect the secrecy of Cabinet proceedings.^99
For his part, the Cabinet Secretary thought ample precedent existed to
warrant the collection of official materials. The Committee of Imperial
Defence had decided in 1908 that no private files of CID papers ought to
be maintained; any access would have to come through the committee's
own file, but Hankey's account gives good reason to think that the rule
had been stretched.^100 However, the War Council, the Dardanelles
Committee and the War Committee had accepted the rule; the question
came to the fore with Arthur Henderson's resignation from the War
Cabinet in August 1917, since the CID precedent clashed with what
Hankey admitted had been the ' immemorial custom' of the Cabinet,
whereby Cabinet papers remained 'the personal property of Cabinet
Ministers on their vacating office.'^101 In making his case for recovery,
Hankey differentiated between peace-time conditions and those under
which the War Cabinet labored, particularly the fact that 'there is no
comparison between the amount of secret information placed at the


68 A man and an institution

```
disposal of the War Cabinet now and before the present Government
assumed office.' Carefully avoiding the Privy Counsellor's Oath, which
prohibited public disclosure of Cabinet documents, Hankey convinced
the War Cabinet to vest property in such materials in His Majesty's
Government. Documents dating to the formation of the government
were to be returned to the Cabinet Office, where ex-ministers would be
allowed access to them, should the need arise.^102 Henderson and Austen
Chamberlain both complied with the decision.
On 4 November 1919 the Cabinet disregarded the war-time precedent,
and Hankey noted,' the Secretary's proposals for continuing the practice
of the War Cabinet were deliberately over-ruled by the Cabinet itself, and
he was thus relieved of the difficult and invidious task of pursuing ex-
Cabinet Ministers with request for the return of all their papers.'^103 The
CID held to established practices, and some retiring ministers handed
over their papers to their successors; on the other hand, Hankey later
noted in high dudgeon,' instances could be given ... of Ministers who,
on retirement, have required a pantechnicon to remove their Papers from
their Offices.' Why had the post-war Cabinet so acted? Obviously some of
its members, Lloyd George and Churchill included, foresaw writing
memoirs of the period. In all fairness to those two, both had already felt
the heat of concerted military and naval criticism, ample reason for them
to break the War Cabinet's precedent now that military secrets mattered
for less. Lloyd George's own stance became even clearer to Hankey when
in 1922 the Cabinet Secretary informed him that the embittered former
Secretary of State for India, Edwin Montagu, intended to take nearly all
his Cabinet papers with him - perhaps for political purposes: the premier
refused to stay Montagu's hand, and he chose not to take the matter up
with his coalition Cabinet.^104 It is difficult not to conclude that Lloyd
George was concerned with his own cache of Cabinet papers rather than
with Montagu's more limited store; and it is conceivable that the premier
thought that he might soon have some use for his own collection: the
political going for the coalition was noticeably rougher, and he had
received 'very big offers' for his memoirs.^105 The Prime Minister's files
included some rare specimens; Frances Stevenson recounted sub-
sequently how he had handed her the Articles of Agreement for the Irish
Treaty of 1921 with the instruction, 'Lock it up carefully.' She did just
that, and the Treaty remained with his papers until claimed by the
Cabinet Office in 1945, after his death: 'The amazing thing was that
during all that time it had never been asked for.'^106 More fitting testimony
to Lloyd George's determination to provide for his own records, or to the
transitory nature of Anglo-Irish agreements?
Frustrated with regard to the custody of Cabinet records, Hankey
asked the Cabinet to consider the question of the possible publication of
```

```
The Lloyd George regime 69
```
```
official materials, admitting that' we have not had very much experience
```
... The majority of our Reports have been of a secret nature and
unsuitable for publication, but there have been exceptions.'^107 Strict rules
for the use of such materials in the Official Histories, written in a branch
of the Cabinet Office, had been drawn up,^108 but ' unofficial' accounts
written by participants who had kept certain government records were
bringing the issue to the fore: 'There were notorious cases where the
policy of Ministers had been attacked by partial and misleading
quotations from Cabinet Papers, and [the post-war Cabinet felt] general
sympathy... with the desire of Ministers to be allowed to use official
papers to defend themselves in such circumstances.' In short order,
Lloyd George had a researcher loose in the War Cabinet records - while
still in office, he contracted to write memoirs - and with the fall of the
coalition in 1922, Bonar Law continued the arrangement: 'The [Army]
Officer in question reads the Papers in the Cabinet Office and takes notes,
but does not take copies or take them away.'^109 Lloyd George's coalition
had gone no further towards resolving the problem than to appoint a
committee, which had not met before the government disintegrated. The
successor Conservative administration appointed a Committee on the
Use of Official Material in Publications, chaired by Lord Curzon,

to prepare for consideration by the Cabinet a code of rules for the future guidance
of Cabinet Ministers and other public servants and Departments in regard to the
following matters:
a) The circumstances in which it is permissible in any publication to refer to
proceedings of the Cabinet, having regard more particularly to the Privy
Counsellor's oath;
b) The circumstances in which it is permissible in any publication to use or
quote from Cabinet or Department documents, however obtained;
c) The rules to be observed by Departments in dealing with applications from
ex-Cabinet Ministers or other public servants for permission to have access
to or quote from official documents in connection with personal memoirs or
other publications.^110
The scope of its inquiry exceeded the question of ministerial access.
Hankey, appointed as Secretary to the Cabinet sub-committee, observed
that the Official Secrets Act could be brought to bear, although it had not
been drafted to cover Cabinet documents; nonetheless, the legislation
could be invoked in the event of unauthorized publication of government
documents by anyone if' it appears that his purpose was... prejudicial to
the safety or interests of the State... unless the contrary was proved.'^111
With guilt presumed until innocence was proved, HMG had a powerful
weapon at their disposal, and so the Official Secrets Act was to prove for
decades to come.
In contradistinction, a cautionary note was brought to the committee's
attention by the Permanent Secretary to the Admiralty, who warned that


```
70 A man and an institution
```
```
the public would have to play a role in determining the degree and even
the type of secrecy which the government might maintain, within the
scope of the Official Secrets Act:
the ex-Minister, the retired Naval Officer and the retired Civil Servant are alike
free to publish official information in their possession, subject to their being no
infringement of the Official Secrets Act, and subject also in the case of the ex-
Ministers to the special obligation as to actual Cabinet proceedings. [Though in
theory the government might prohibit]... anything dealing with their exercise
of their official position [such action would] ... go beyond what is necessary in
the public interest, would not be supported by the public, and would never really
be observed or enforced.^112
```
Officially informed reminiscences, in other words, were very different
from official documents. Whether this sensible document dampened
Hankey's enthusiasm for some rules it is impossible to say, but the
Curzon Committee, like its predecessor, never met; there is no trace in
the files of the abandonment of its mission. The situation remained as it
had, and officially informed publication flourished, though there re-
mained the risk - however dimly perceived - of violating the Official
Secrets Act.

As well as the survival of the Cabinet Secretariat, the year 1919 had
witnessed a significant strengthening of the Treasury's role; the relation-
ship between the two was to prove Hankey's most daunting problem in
the immediate post-war years. In September of that year, the Permanent
Secretary to the Treasury had been named as well the official Head of the
Civil Service, implicitly recognizing the ' General Staff' function which
the Treasury discharged for the government.^113 Although Treasury
stalwarts claimed to trace the devolution of such a role for the Permanent
Secretary to 1867, the re-organization of 1919 formally specified the
responsibility, which a new and able Permanent Secretary, Sir Warren
Fisher, seized upon as a means of improving the quality and efficiency of
the Civil Service.^114 Such a re-organization was in no way directed
towards Hankey's responsibilities in the Cabinet Secretariat: ' It would
be constitutionally wrong to assume that for general government matters,
as distinct from financial affairs, the permanent Head of the Treasury had
been in any measure supplanted during the inter-war years by the
development of the office of Secretary to the Cabinet.'^115 Hankey had at
no time entered a claim to administer 'general government matters,' and
the official spheres in which he and Fisher moved were quite distinct,
although on occasion they did intersect. Yet that separation will not admit
to Greaves' view that the Secretariat emerged as 'that off-shoot from the
Treasury,' because no such process had occurred; its roots lay elsewhere.
In considerable measure, Fisher's appointment as Head of the Civil


```
The Lloyd George regime 71
```
Service was designed to resolve a particular problem which concerned
some leading members of the regime, namely the impending retirements
of a number of leading civil servants who headed ' traditional' depart-
ments anxious to maintain or to regain their independent standing.^116
Through Fisher's involvement in senior appointments, the coalition
sought to escape the departmentalism inherent in the Civil Service,
which the new Head personally detested; his exercise of such a role over
two decades and his outspoken manner - reflected in 'sweepingly
condemnatory remarks' about those civil servants who fell shy of his high
standards - earned Fisher a number of enemies and account for his still
controversial reputation.^117 Yet another important aspect of his appoint-
ment deserves mention: his enlarged responsibilities strengthened the
role of the premier and were crucial in the turn towards what has been
called - with some exaggeration - 'prime ministerial government,' with
the Prime Minister standing at the apex of a centralized administrative
structure.^118 Thus, if the establishment of the Cabinet Secretariat is
viewed as the first major administrative departure from 'traditional'
Cabinet government, then the bureaucratic centralization inherent in the
Treasury re-organization is the second. Both were restraints upon the
departmentalism of the old order, and both enhanced the authority - and
the powers - of the premier. Representatives of reform, Fisher and
Hankey proved to be occasional rivals as well as allies in that cause. For
long periods they went their separate ways, but Hankey had no difficulty
in honoring aspects of' Treasury control' which had atrophied during the
war. In December 1919 the Chancellor, Austen Chamberlain, proposed
that a member of the Treasury staff be seconded to the Cabinet
Secretariat - serving under Hankey and available for general services -
' to resume the old-established arrangement under which Public Depart-
ments were accustomed to thresh out with the Treasury - from the outset

- proposals which may involve charges upon the Exchequer.'^119 Hankey
welcomed the proposal, and the Cabinet, accepting Chamberlain's
contention that the principle had yielded to the press of business during
the war, agreed with him that the Treasury role should be restored.^120
    In one regard, however, Hankey questioned the Coalition
government's view of the relationship between the Secretariat and the
Treasury, as he opposed in vain a Treasury-initiated proposal which in
April 1921 shifted the budgetary provision for what was known as the
    Cabinet Office from a category within 'Treasury and Subordinate
    Departments' Vote' to a separate status.^121 Hankey himself wished to
    keep his operation at a remove from direct review, as he contended that
    'the delicate day to day functions of the Cabinet Secretary were difficult
    of adequate exposition in Parliament.' He viewed the Prime Minister as
    the Head of the Cabinet Office as well as First Lord of the Treasury and


```
72 A man and an institution
```
argued that he should have only one department, accepting a view of the
Treasury as a 'foster parent' of the Secretariat.^122 Curiously, he was
prepared to forego theoretical autonomy, apparently because the alter-
native was in 1921 more threatening: Hankey must have feared that the
Cabinet Office could be thrust into the political arena by the new
arrangements, with the Prime Minister directly responsible for the
conduct of the office; the confusion between the two Secretariats was in
the process increased.
The Cabinet Office had successfully made the transition to the post-
war period, although the deaf ear which Hankey turned to another
proposal indicates his caution lest the Secretariat encroach upon the
departments. To a proposal that the Secretariat include an organization
to which the public might turn with complaints about departmental
administration - the forerunner of the Scandinavian ombudsman - Tom
Jones took first objection: 'To have this work done well requires persons
able to weigh the complaints and able to set in motion appropriate action,
or in serious cases, to call the P. M.'s personal attention.'^123 Despite
Lloyd George's initial enthusiasm for the 'Ministry of Complaints,'
Jones and Hankey convinced him that any action would have to be taken
in his own name, rather than that of the Secretariat, and the premier chose
to go no further with the concept, whose time had not yet come.
In structural terms, the post-war Cabinet Office incorporated the
Cabinet Secretariat, a much smaller Secretariat for the Committee of
Imperial Defence, a small branch charged with the publication of Official
War Histories and another responsible for all communications dealing
with the League of Nations. Functionally, however, Cabinet Office
responsibilities were divided into two main branches, dealing with home
and external affairs, although there was both overlap and close co-
ordination between the two.^124 The Home Affairs Branch was led by Tom
Jones; the Imperial, Foreign, and Defence Branch was renamed in 1922
the Committee of Imperial Defence Branch, although it continued to
serve non-CID Cabinet committees dealing with defence matters or
foreign affairs. Its principal Secretaries were seconded from the War
Office, the Admiralty and the India Office; the Treasury representative
sat with the Home Affairs Branch. Hankey was personally pleased with
the renaming of the other branch, which symbolized the revival of the
CID proper, as no one had worked harder than he to revive that
organization once the war was over. He encountered a good deal of prime
ministerial foot-dragging, but the CID met at the end of June 1920 - its
first meeting in more than five years.^125 Yet while the coalition survived,
the CID did not flourish; indeed, Lloyd George's refusal to use the CID
to gain a realistic military evaluation of developments in the Near East
contributed to his downfall.


```

```
The existence within the Cabinet Office of a branch dealing with the
publication of the Official Histories was natural, considering that the
Secretariat had been the repository of all Cabinet documents dealing with
the Great War. Yet the charge of writing authorized history was delicate,
not least in the need for the branch to avoid any direct quotation of
Cabinet documents. Hankey had never been fully comfortable with the
inclusion of the Historical Section in the CID ambit, in part because as
Secretary he had greater claims upon his time: 'Consequently, it has
always been, to a considerable extent, a separate organization.'^126
Nonetheless, in May 1921 he gained Cabinet approval of guidelines for
the Official Historians lodged in his office: these sought to bar the use of
such descriptive terms as War Council, Dardanelles Committee, War
Cabinet, and the like, instead mandating a decision' by the Government';
as well the Official Historians should ' on no account give any indication
of the views expressed by any individual member' of those bodies, except
where accounts published by the Dardanelles and Mesopotamia Com-
missions had already done so.^127 Guidelines which implicitly stressed
collective responsibility were one thing, but selection of materials and
facts is inherent in the writing of history. Winston Churchill vented his
displeasure on this score with the first volumes of Sir Julian Corbett's
Naval Operations, which in some thousand pages,
```
```
adduce almost every essential fact, and cites or quotes all the important telegrams
```
... All these telegrams were approved in writing by me and the bulk of them are
my own drafts. Anyone who chooses to read the late [he had died in 1922] Sir
Julian Corbett's text and compare the lengthy summaries of the telegrams with
the actual texts, will see how extremely unsatisfactory and how unintentionally
unfair this method of citation is.^128

Regardless of the merits of Churchill's complaint, the episode illustrates
that someone's historical standing is always at stake, even where Official
Histories are involved - perhaps more so because of the authoritative
connotation - and those governmental bodies which are associated with
such work cannot wholly avoid the cross-fire. Interpretation is open to
objection, as when in 1924 a Foreign Office-sponsored confidential
history of the Paris Peace Conference accused Lloyd George of bad faith
in the matter of reparations; Hankey challenged the allegation, and
commented generally to Balfour, Foreign Secretary at the time of
Versailles:

If confidential histories are to be written, no one is safe. There may be at this
moment chapters of Mr. Headlam-Morley's [the author of the work in question]
history which damn your reputation or mine, of the very existence of which we
have no knowledge. They may have been lying, for two or three years in the
Foreign Office without our knowledge. Some years hence they will probably be
handed over to the Record Office and accepted by the world as a correct account.


```
74 A man and an institution
```
The obvious remedy appears to be that they should be communicated to all
concerned.^129
Such ' confidential' histories were produced by the departments, outside
the watch of the Cabinet Office; the Official Histories were at this time
written within the branch for publication, although the process proved to
be a lengthy one. The branch proved to be as durable as the Cabinet
Office.
However, the attachment of a League of Nations Branch proved of far
less duration. At first, Hankey had betrayed no particular enthusiasm for
the inclusion of such a function within his office; however, in 1920 the
Cabinet decided that the Cabinet Office should serve as the distributing
office for League business, without executive or advisory authority. The
Cabinet Secretary informed the premier that such an arrangement would
not work, because of overlap between the branch and a Foreign Office
staff official; instead, he secured the agreement of Balfour and Hardinge
to an amalgamation in which that official would be transferred to the
Cabinet Office in order to handle all communications with the League.^130
Lloyd George agreed, and expressed his pleasure that the consolidation
had made for greater efficiency at no increased price; he noted the Foreign
Office's satisfaction that their own man headed the League operation. For
his part, Hankey now welcomed the clear lodging of responsibility for the
conduct of League affairs within the Cabinet Office,^131 although he
subsequently had cause to regret the move.
Given such a diversity of tasks, the Cabinet Office personnel -
exclusive of the Historical Branch - remained near the war-time comple-
ment, at a time when stringent economies were called for by the
government: while CID ranks declined from 27 to 14 in peace-time,
Cabinet Office staffing stood at 123 in 1922, only a score less than in 1919.
Such staffing levels may have engendered skepticism among those who
were told the office was engaged only in the task of keeping Cabinet
records. Hankey's own salary, which had risen sharply over a decade to
one of the highest of all government salaries, may have occasioned some
envy among senior civil servants.^132 Certainly some criticism followed
upon the Cabinet Office's assuming League of Nations work, which
appeared to confirm the alleged encroachment of the Secretariat upon the
preserves of the Foreign Office. In Parliament, fears of a bureaucratic loss
of control were voiced by a former Secretariat assistant, Ormsby-Gore:' I
speak with some knowledge ... I know what it is and how well it works -
very largely because it is a small Department. The whole secret of Sir
Maurice Hankey's success was, I believe, because the office was kept
small and under his own personal supervision in every corner of it.'^133 An
as yet unknown MP, Oswald Mosley, spoke in much harsher terms of the
abuses of a 'vicious system' of which the Cabinet Office was an integral


```
The Lloyd George regime 75
```
part: 'The Prime Minister to-day surrounds himself with a staff of
amateurs who improvise settlements in a European situation of peculiar
difficulties and complexity, and the relationship between the expert
Foreign Office staff and this band of amateurs is highly anomalous.'^134
Mosley - whether or not deliberately - confused the two Secretariats,
although Hankey and the Cabinet Office had not eschewed 'foreign
policy' altogether. The Cabinet Office was staffed by competent ad-
ministrators, some of whom were seconded from the departments, but
the ' system' of government which had replaced the old departmental
order sustained a major assault in 1922; its repercussions were severely
felt in Whitehall Gardens.

```
The Cabinet Secretariat's crisis was a direct result of the fall of Lloyd
George's Coalition government in the autumn of that year; political
collapse was rooted in conservative distrust of and some antipathy
towards the Prime Minister's supposedly reckless leadership. Directly at
issue was the conduct of British foreign policy, particularly in the
unsettled situation in the Near East. Yet dispute over policy took place in
a wider setting, namely the decline of the Foreign Office as the sole
institution for the formulation as well as execution of foreign policy. For a
number of reasons, institutional and personal, the Foreign Office had,
even prior to the deposition of Asquith, entered into the shadow of
eclipse,^135 which deepened with the exclusion of Foreign Secretary
Balfour from the War Cabinet. Lloyd George's well-known disregard for
traditional institutions, and his preference for private rather than official
advice, predisposed him to turn to the Prime Minister's Secretariat, and
to a lesser extent and in a personal fashion to Hankey, instead of to the
Foreign Office.^136 Though not a leading sinner, Hankey no doubt
provoked resentment within the tradition-bound Foreign Office because
'he was qualified and, indeed, willing to offer advice and to give his
opinion on all aspects of war policy.'^137
The inclusion of the Foreign Secretary in the post-war Cabinet and the
succession of Curzon to that post improved the prospects for a revival of
the institution, particularly since Balfour had shown no inclination to
lead. Yet Lloyd George had no particular difficulty in getting his way
with Curzon, for all the latter's bluster; moreover, hopes entertained in
the Foreign Office for a reversion to the ways of the period before 1914
were delusive, for the same reason that any return to the pre-war Cabinet
system was impossible: foreign affairs could no longer be kept in a water-
tight compartment, separate and distinct from other concerns;^138 instead,
the conduct of British external policy had to be co-ordinated at the
Cabinet level. Though the war had thrown up myriad problems with
external and domestic aspects - shipping, blockade, manpower, food
```

supplies among others - in the post-war era the question of reparations
alone serves to illustrate the inability of the Foreign Office to' go it alone.'
Understandably, however, the Secretariats remained foci of discontent
as agencies for Lloyd George's intrusion into areas reserved until a few
years earlier for' experts.' For some the prominent role Hankey played in
British deputations abroad was an affront, although the Cabinet Sec-
retary was satisfied in his own mind that his secretarial presence was as
justified at such conferences as within the Cabinet:
These Conferences are concerned with business that is just as much interdepart-
mental as international... Moreover, the interdepartmental questions dealt with
at these Conferences are essentially of the order of Cabinet questions and it is
convenient that they should be handled in their secretarial aspects by the same
office which handles them secretarially for the Cabinet. By these means a
continuous and fully indexed record has been built up of all the international
Conferences from the beginning of the war until to-day. Moreover, the Cabinet
Secretariat has acquired an experience of secretarial work and of co-ordination in
international, imperial and national affairs, which is certainly unique and of
considerable value in facilitating the transactions of the business of our
widespread Empire.^139
Since the Secretariat possessed no executive or advisory functions,
Hankey contended its role was beyond suspicion, but he did not reflect
upon his own advisory capacity; in that sense he differentiated between
the man and the institution, but his critics did not. And the man engaged
in personal diplomacy, although he protested his inclusion on a special
mission with Lord d'Abernon and General Radcliffe to investigate the
Polish frontier dispute in 1920.^140 Further, Hankey badly miscalculated
the resolution of this confrontation with Bolshevik Russia; he thought the
Poles 'were absolutely done and a hopeless people altogether,' and thus
was very much surprised by their recovery.^141 Hankey's role has been
strongly criticized, in the main because he ' possessed the habit of saying
what he was expected to say' and presented biased and ill-informed
information which confirmed Lloyd George in his determination to avoid
entanglement in Poland.^142 Clear flaws in his reportage can be cited,
stemming in appalling measure from Hankey's interest in phrenology,
seemingly never stronger than during the Polish mission; yet the other
members of the Inter-Allied mission fared no better, and Hankey, the
Secretary, 'had nothing to do but watch the successive failures of his
colleagues.'^143 From the perspective of the Foreign Office, the mission,
regarded from the outset 'as the prime minister's private outfit,'^144 served
as an illustration of Lloyd George's errant diplomacy; they had good
reason to consider the Cabinet Secretary among the knights errant.
On the other hand, the Prime Minister had his own complaints about
the traditional conduct of British foreign policy, which he thought partly
responsible for the outbreak of the war. Writing about the years from
1906, he asserted:


```
The Lloyd George regime 77
```
There was a reticence and a secrecy which practically ruled out three-fourths of
the Cabinet from any chance of making any genuine contribution to the
momentous questions of foreign policy then fermenting... Direct questions
were answered with civility but were not encouraged... we were not privileged
to know any more of the essential facts than those which the ordinary newspaper
reader could gather.^145
In his post-war administration, Lloyd George on occasion reversed the
process, as Curzon and many of his colleagues were ignorant of the
premier's personal diplomacy: if Clemenceau regarded war as too
important to be left to the generals, his British counterpart viewed foreign
policy as too significant to be consigned to the diplomats. Even Balfour
had grown impatient with the premier's use of Philip Kerr in high-level
negotiations at Versailles, but Lloyd George believed that 'open dip-
lomacy' obviated the need for the traditional agencies and methods of
foreign affairs.^146 Critics of Lloyd George's modus operandi objected to
the same flaws which those who had denounced the ' old diplomacy' had
earlier pointed to: 'The tortuous mentality, secretive methods and
exclusive loyalties of which the Diplomatic Corps was... suspected can
rarely have been so blatant as in the behaviour of Lloyd George's personal
representative [Hankey] in Poland.'^147
Contemporary hopes ran high that Curzon, an experienced hand,
would restore Foreign Office primacy, but in the event he did not contest
Lloyd George for supremacy in the making of foreign policy.^148 Although
he did threaten his own resignation periodically, he apparently enjoyed
office too much to follow through; he reasoned as well that his own
resignation would leave no significant check upon the premier's mistaken
ways.^149 Several of his close friends sustained him in the acceptance of
personal humiliation as a patriotic virtue.^150 Despite the personal strains
between the two men, it is important to recognize that they were not in
basic disagreement about the general outlines of post-war British foreign
policy. The Foreign Secretary was fully prepared to defer to the
premier's lead on a number of issues, and on others he was given what
Harold Nicolson has described as 'perfectly unrestricted scope, or
subjected to perfectly normal management.'^151 One problem persisted:
' It was only on the Eastern question, on the question of the Turkish
settlement, that his more expert opinion was deliberately ignored.' With
this important exception, substantive matters were not the crux of the
deteriorating relationship; instead, Lloyd George's cavalier treatment of
the Foreign Secretary and Curzon's distrust of an irresponsible cabal
round the Prime Minister fed upon each other. For all Curzon's bluster
and bombast, those who witnessed the struggle between the two felt some
sympathy for the Foreign Secretary, perhaps because the contest was not
an even one. Hankey thought that Lloyd George 'bullied' his Foreign
Secretary, adding: 'He always bullies those Ministers who have little


```
jS A man and an institution
```
popular following.' When Curzon was rebuked in a Cabinet meeting,
Bonar Law spoke to the premier, who pointed to this very factor; Hankey
recorded Law's response: ' Still, he is a very big man, and his colleagues
will not stand to have him treated like this.' The Cabinet Secretary
himself thought that Lloyd George indulged himself in 'a touch of
swelled head,' although he judged that the premier remained 'much the
biggest man among them.' Even in its early stages, the dispute threatened
the unity of the coalition, Hankey noted in his diary, confident that Bonar
Law shared his doubts about its long-term survival.^152 Neither may have
fathomed the smoldering resentment which Curzon felt with the pattern
of prime ministerial involvement in the widely heralded post-war
alternative to the 'old diplomacy,' namely the new-fangled 'diplomacy
by conference,'^153 conferences, alas, from which the Foreign Secretary
was often excluded. In his words:' When I reflect that the P.M. is alone at
Genoa with no F.O. to guide him... and when I recall the whole trend of
his policy for the past three years -1 can feel no certainty that we may not
find ourselves committed to something pregnant with political disaster
here.' An element of consolation occurred to Curzon after the failure of
the Genoa Conference:' I hope that this will be the last of these fantastic
gatherings which are really only designed as a stage on which he is to
perform.'^154 For Curzon, the ' lines' spoken on that stage mattered not so
much as the fact that Lloyd George took them all himself.

At a time when an occasionally distraught Foreign Secretary held less
than firm command over British foreign policy, the Near Eastern crisis
came to a head in September 1922. Under the able leadership of
Mustapha Kemal, Turkish resistance to the terms of the Treaty of Sevres
```
- incorporating territorial gains for Greece at Turkish expense -
    strengthened; France and Italy preferred concessions rather than armed
    confrontation with Turkey. Despite such waverings by the Allies, Lloyd
    George remained adamant in his support of the pro-Greek terms, even
    accepting the restoration of the notoriously pro-German King Con-
    stantine late in 1920; invoking British naval and imperial concerns, the
    premier yielded no quarter to the traditional pro-Turkish protestations
    of his Tory colleagues. Buoyed by support from such a powerful quarter,
    Greece carried well into Asia Minor the military attempt to enforce the
    terms of Sevres, provoking a formidable resistance which was com-
    pounded by French defection from the effort in October 1921. Kemal
    regrouped and chose his opportunity to take the offensive well: so
    complete was the resulting rout of the Greek forces that by September
       1922 only an outnumbered contingent of British forces, encamped at
    Chanak on the southern shore of the Dardanelles, stood between the
    Turkish Army and its reconquest of the lost European provinces of the

Ottoman Empire. A crossing of the Straits threatened a renewal of war;
the British Cabinet met on 15 September to consider a further course of
action, including an appeal for assistance to the dominions.
In view of the past differences over the merits of conflicting claims, the
Cabinet emerged from that meeting surprisingly united and clearly
resolute. Supported primarily by an experienced quartet - Balfour,
Birkenhead, Austen Chamberlain, and Churchill - Lloyd George
secured a Cabinet warning to Kemal to respect the allied zone of
occupation at the Straits; the French premier, Poincare, agreed, not
without misgivings, to the warning. The Cabinet also solicited dominion
support, albeit in a clumsy fashion which won backing only from the
governments of New Zealand and Newfoundland. Unfortunately, most
dominion leaders learned first of the warning from a press communique
issued from Downing Street rather than directly from the British
government. That communique, issued on the following day, was so
strongly worded that the French government backed off again; only the
diligent efforts of the Foreign Secretary, dispatched forthwith to Paris,
persuaded Poincare to maintain even the facade of Anglo-French
solidarity. The experience was a wrenching experience for Curzon, who
commented about the French premier: ' I can't bear that horrid little
man.'^155 Given his lengthier frustrating exchanges with the British Prime
Minister, he might well have used the plural. The explosive situation in
Asia Minor did not ease until mid-October, when what Churchill
described as the worst moment of Anglo-French relations in the
twentieth century^156 had passed - alas, he was to preside over worse. In
the Chanak crisis, Lloyd George carried with him a reluctant Cabinet and
an equivocal Foreign Secretary, at the risk of renewed war; indeed, there
are those who have found in these events 'the last occasion on which
Great Britain stood up to a potential aggressor before the outbreak of
the Second World War.'^157 Yet the price paid by Lloyd George was the
fall of his government and his loss of office, which he never regained.
Even informed contemporaries marveled at this conjunction of events,
as in Leo Amery's noting that 'a great many people abroad and in the
Dominions and not a few at home will be puzzled as to why the crisis
should have arisen just at the moment when the Govt has on the whole
covered itself [sic] with credit by its handling of the Eastern situation.'^158
The explanation lies in the tenuous dynamic of coalition government:
within the Cabinet Lloyd George claimed to feel that he was 'the only
Liberal left, the only upholder of the Gladstonian policy.'^159 In recent
years Lloyd George had encountered strong opposition to his pro-Greek
stance. With the sole exception of Balfour,

all the others have done their best to obstruct & the W.O. have behaved
abominably. However D. [Lloyd George] has got his way, but he is much afraid


80 A man and an institution

lest the Greek attack should be a failure, & he should be proved to have been
wrong. He says his political reputation depends a great deal on what happens in
Asia Minor.^160

The domestic dimension of the Chanak crisis is found in its use to fell a
leader whose style of leadership had become unacceptable to a number of
his Tory allies. Stanley Baldwin, for example, held the mores of the
leading members of the coalition in contempt:

You can't imagine the impression the meetings of the Cabinet made on me. I had
been in business for years ... In business you discuss a thing and decide whether
to do it or not, but as I watched L. G.'s Cabinet - watching each of its members
under a microscope -1 felt I was in a thieves' kitchen. Nobody seemed to have any
principles. There was the most awful cynicism. Perhaps it was all due to a reaction
after the war.^161

Surely the strain of nearly six years of governing had taken its toll,
because the administration was gripped by malaise: the Prime Minister's
Secretariat was in near-chaos, with no effective head; the Cabinet was
divided, although - ironically - perhaps less so over the Near East than on
other issues; even the Court was disturbed by its cavalier treatment at the
hands of the regime.^162
Lloyd George entertained the hope that by giving a strong lead - in a
matter which extended the epic struggle of the Great War - others would
be compelled to follow, as in fact his Cabinet did; yet he may have
mistaken his ability to prevail over opposition within his Cabinet as the
key to political developments. Such a key did not turn other important
constituencies in his behalf: the public remained indifferent, the press
hostile, and vocal sections of Parliament were critical of ' aggressive'
actions in the Near East.^163 Yet there is no evidence that the Prime
Minister carried on a secret pro-Greek policy behind his Cabinet's back;
the Foreign Secretary lost the contest in open Cabinet rather than to a
secret cabal.^164 Lloyd George deceived himself that his ability to carry the
leading Conservative coalitionists would breathe new life into his
administration. In fact he and his Unionist Cabinet colleagues reckoned
up the political 'risk' incorrectly, since the rank-and-file remained as
determined as ever to break with his leadership.^165
His critics were particularly appalled by the Cabinet communique of
mid-September, which was widely viewed as a reckless document.^166
Cabinet records confirm that it was but one product of a Cabinet meeting
which reflected 'many ideas but few decisions ... in the end the Cabinet
decided to try something of everything,'^167 including this document, a
draft telegram for the dominion premiers, drawn up by Winston
Churchill. Neither in its language nor in its tardy dispatch to the
dominions did it prove a particularly good idea, and the response was
distinctly cool; Mackenzie King sounded the most cynical note in


```
The Lloyd George regime 81
```
recording in his diary, 'All were inclined to feel whole business "an
election scheme" of Lloyd George and Co.'^168 Some of the resulting
criticism incorporated the notion that the Cabinet Secretariat had a
devious role in the Chanak crisis, an indictment given a place of
prominence in the correspondence columns of The Times. Alleging that
the manifesto of 16 September was 'presumably, due to the existence of
the Cabinet Secretariat - an institution unknown to the Constitution, and
the sole creation of the present Prime Minister,' J. G. Swift MacNeill
judged that the document 'ought to be the death warrant of the Cabinet
Secretariat.' Such unfounded allegations were disputed in other portions
of the press; the Yorkshire Post labeled as 'misapprehension' the belief
that the Cabinet Secretariat had acted as a 'pro-war agency' in the Near
Eastern crisis; on the contrary, its role was to keep the records of Cabinet
deliberations.^169
Those records - which include a near-verbatim account of the meeting
of 15 September - establish that Hankey's office had nothing to do with
the fateful communique. In the Cabinet, Curzon had been an active,
albeit defeated, participant, and ultimately he expressed no dissent from
the Cabinet's agreement to take diplomatic and military steps 'to
safeguard the neutral zone of the Straits against the Turkish menace.'^170
Although there were no specific instructions given for the issuance of a
communique/manifesto, both the content and even the tone of the
document of 16 September are consistent with the gravity of the
measures agreed to by the entire Cabinet. On the following afternoon,
Churchill - who had hitherto opposed Lloyd George's pro-Greek
predilections but now refused, in his words, 'to scuttle at the approach of
armed men' - drafted, at the behest of the premier and his principal
colleagues, Curzon excepted, a press communique which in brusque
language depicted the Turkish menace to the peace.^171 Of the provenance
of the document, there could be no question, and Hankey was outraged
that his office should reap criticism for Churchill's effort.
The issue of a statement of this kind is no part of the duty of the Cabinet
Secretariat. As a matter of fact, no member of the Cabinet Secretariat saw the
statement before reading it in the public press. The allegation... that this
statement was the result of deliberation at the Cabinet at which the Secretary of
State for Foreign Affairs was not present is entirely without foundation.^172
The latter point arose because Curzon had protested the communique
drafted in his absence - he had withdrawn to the country following the
Cabinet meeting - but Lloyd George retorted that the Foreign
Secretary's behavior had been 'extraordinary' and that the Foreign
Office functioned only 'sometimes.'^173 The two men were thereafter
thoroughly disaffected with one another; Curzon saw in Lloyd George's
action confirmation of a pattern of events, although he spared Hankey


```
82 A man and an institution
```
from his criticism: 'I have suffered as you know terribly from the
encroachment of Downing Street but never from yours. You have always
been a model of constitutional propriety and personal consideration.'^174
What Curzon characterized as' the encroachment of Downing Street' led
directly to the rupture within the coalition, despite the successful
resolution of the Chanak crisis.
Curzon did not press his case in the Cabinet, but he did summarize his
case against Lloyd George's ' system' in a letter written on 3 October but
characteristically never sent to the premier:

Thus there has grown up a system under which there are in reality two Foreign
Offices: the one for which I am for the time being responsible and the other at
Number 10 - with the essential difference between them that, whereas I report
not only to you but to all my colleagues everything that I say or do, every telegram
that I receive or send, every communication of importance that reaches me, it is
only by accident that I hear what is being done by the other Foreign Office; and
even when I am informed officially of what has passed there, it has nevertheless
been done, in many cases without the Foreign Office, for which I am responsible,
knowing that the communication was going to be made or the interview take place

... There cannot be a doubt that public opinion has not merely condemned this
procedure as unconstitutional and improper, but has clamoured without a
dissentient voice for its cessation.^175

While Curzon's particulars were self-serving, Lloyd George's ' system'
had troubled others too, for reasons judiciously stated by Harold
Nicolson: 'The implication is not that the Prime Minister's methods [in
foreign policy] were ever consciously evasive or misleading; the impli-
cation is that they were personal, forensic, imprecise, variable, conceited
and far too private.'^176 Yet such irregular ways required the confidence of
his coalition colleagues and parliamentary supporters.
Such confidence was undermined by the divisive events of autumn
1922, but the Prime Minister could hardly be expected to mend his ways,
because a personal approach to affairs of state was the only way in which
he could lead.^177 By nature a maverick politician, Lloyd George's politics
of improvisation were all too readily equated with a sheer lack of
principle. Indeed, he recognized such a criticism of his methods, even if-
as in 1922 - he underestimated the gravamen of the charge. In this vein he
once remarked to Bonar Law: 'Bonar, you know, I can conceive of
circumstances arising in which I might be compelled to act on principle
myself - but you can't say that of FE Smith [later Lord Birkenhead] or
Winston can you?'^178 Yet he could not afford to look humorously upon
the political situation, because with the passage of time the unanswered
question of the 1919 General Election - whether the Unionists needed
Lloyd George more than he needed them, in order to govern - had been
resolved in their favor: the Prime Minister had lost much of his Labour
support because of his industrial policy, and he had forfeited some of his


```

```
Liberal and radical backing through his Irish policy, despite the
settlement of 1921.^179
Unionist MPs had accepted his war leadership, but, a few Tory leaders
aside, ' the Conservatives had never viewed him with trust or affection;
and, what was more important, they had never suggested that they meant
to remain his allies once he had served his immediate purpose.'^180
Although the leading members of the Cabinet were not prepared to turn
the premier out, others were sincerely troubled; Baldwin, of course, was
particularly concerned with what he thought the corroding effect of
Lloyd George upon his colleagues' moral susceptibilities, and he found in
the premier's actions 'a profound threat, made more serious because of
the wide appeal which apparently easy, authoritarian solutions had over
the slow processes of democracy.'^181 The list of grievances was a long one,
but principal items included 'the close conspiracy, the leaks to those
papers whose support he needed, the muzzling of the rest of the press, the
discussion of Cabinet secrets with Beaverbrook and Rothermere, the
prostitution of judicial office and the sale of honours.' Yet it may be
argued that Lloyd George's abuses were not so out of step with those of
his own contemporaries: his practices differed from those of his time in
degree rather than in kind, although his methods were far from
circumspect. While his involvement in the sale of honors was evident, he
defended his actions with reference to the practices of the time,
contending that it was better to sell honors than policies, as he claimed the
Tories and Labour regularly did.^182
Yet when that defence is entered, his idiosyncratic refusal to heed the
conventions of the business at hand made for a difference in the method of
his operations, if not in the content of his policies. Fittingly, Stanley
Baldwin articulated such instinctive feelings at the decisive moment in
Lloyd George's fall from power, the meeting of the Unionist MPs at the
Carlton Club. The fact remains that Lloyd George's alleged 'adventur-
ism ' in the Near East did not precipitate the Tory desire to have done
with his leadership; rather the events of the autumn 1922 supplied
reinforcement for ousting a leader who no longer fulfilled an essential
purpose.^183 According to Beaverbrook, Lloyd George recognized that the
changing tides of politics had eroded his ability to lead; he had the option
of resigning office, with the Chanak chapter successfully closed, thereby
opening the way for the resumption of party government. Why did he not?

```
There is only one explanation - infirmity of purpose ... He knew he was
damaging his own best interests by refusing to surrender power for a time. The
glitter of his supreme office held him in chains and he could not bear to give up
power and patronage, even for a few months or a year or even two, with the
prospect of a return to his high office. It was weakness and he knew it was
weakness... the will had gone.^184
```

```
84 A man and an institution
```
Politics for Lloyd George had become a means to the end of retaining
office: success at Chanak meant power in Westminster. Whether or not
aware that 'the communique of September 16 had been a stroke of
reckless genius justified by the result,'^185 the premier may well have
convinced himself that the coalition would survive. Certainly the leading
Cabinet ministers stood with him to a man, and even Curzon had been
cowed once again into submission. In fact, the Chanak' success' disposed
the Tory coalitionists to push their rank-and-file critics into a corner on
the issue of another coalition electoral venture, led by Lloyd George.^186
At this juncture a dispute erupted between the leadership and other
groupings within the party - not only back-benchers, but as well a' revolt
of the Under-Secretaries'^187 - and the coalition fell as a result.
Along with the Unionist leaders, Lloyd George failed to take into
account political forces below the Cabinet level; Bonar Law, from
without, hazarded an explanation which time and the proliferation of
government bureaucracy has added force to: 'My experience is that all
Prime Ministers suffer by suppression. Their friends do not tell them the
truth; they tell them what they want to hear. It was so with Asquith...
George also was misled. People are always apt to think that what had been
will be.'^188 The Lloyd George regime came to its end. What would be the
fate of the' system' which he had forged in war-time to energize the forces
of government? Would administrative practices revert to the 'time-
honoured' customs which had served his predecessors? Had that
' system' insulated the Prime Minister from political reality, serving to
the premier's detriment as an agent of what Bonar Law feared as
'suppression'? It is no exaggeration to state that the fate of the Cabinet
Secretariat hinged on Bonar Law's attitude to such questions, since the
political succession was his.

Crisis 1922

For the Cabinet Secretariat, the political crisis of the autumn of 1922
occurred at a time when, along with the Lloyd George ' system,^5 the body
had sustained mounting criticism. The Daily Express had swung into
action late in the previous year, and in the course of 1922 both the Sunday
Express and The Economist had joined the fray.^1 In June the well-
informed Viscount Esher was sufficiently concerned to write to the Prime
Minister that' Beaverbrook and Co seem in full cry after Hankey and are
not easy to whip off.' He suggested that Lloyd George ask two former
premiers, Balfour and Asquith, and the titular leader of the Labour party,
Adamson, to discuss with him 'the future of a Cabinet Secretariat,' if
possible limiting the conversation to 'the necessity for some such body.'^2
Apparently nothing came of the suggestion, although it indicates that
Esher once again looked with favor upon Hankey's endeavors; only two
years earlier, he had written to Tom Jones in a vein which suggested that a
less attractive characteristic of the Lloyd George regime had rubbed off
on the Cabinet Secretary: 'When Hankey digs the Secretariat in far
deeper than he has at present, it will, as far as its personnel is concerned,
disappear with any change of Ministers. The virtue goes out of some men
when success touches the hem of their garment. I fear Hankey is one of
these.'^3

The pace of the criticism of the institution quickened in June 1922,
when Parliament launched upon its most extensive debate since 1918. On
a motion to reduce the parliamentary estimate of the Cabinet Secretariat,
Sir Donald Maclean opened for the Liberal Opposition by acknowledg-
ing that constitutional usage varied from generation to generation; thus
the relevant tests were whether the Secretariat was a useful body and
whether its functions conflicted with vital aspects of Cabinet govern-
ment. On the latter point, he lamented the transfer of power from the
Cabinet to the Prime Minister, which characterized Lloyd George's
' system':' I say that it is not in the interests of the nation that more power

```
85
```

```
86 A man and an institution
```
should pass into the hands of the Prime Minister. Otherwise, what will
happen? We shall, inevitably, be driven to an imitation of the Presidential
system.' Turning to the Secretariat, Maclean suggested that it interfered
with the Foreign Office and the Civil Service, without any success in
discharging its liaison tasks: 'Perhaps the Cabinet Secretariat has this in
its favour, that without it things might have been much worse. All that I
can say is that it would be rather difficult to have things much worse in
many respects than they are.'^4 As had others before him, Maclean
confused policy formulation with the mechanism needed for its im-
plementation, but he properly suggested that any such system had to be
measured by its results, which were held against the Secretariat's
performance. Concern with the Secretariat's anomalous role in the
machinery of government was voiced even by coalition supporters; Lord
Eustace Percy, for example, granted that the Secretariat possessed no
executive machinery, yet he held that in fact it discharged executive
functions, which produced 'a constant chopping and changing in the
locus of responsibility.' As for the result: 'administrative and executive
execution is muddled and weakened and divided and distributed between
multifarious agencies.'^5 Authority should be restored to the Cabinet, he
concluded.
An outspoken back-bencher viewed a nefarious design behind the
confused picture which Percy had depicted:

[The Secretariat] seems to me rather to be a machine whereby the Prime Minister
has brought about... what amounts to a revolution in our system of government,
a revolution involving a great breach of our Parliamentary traditions and a very
great blow at our historical safeguards ... I believe that many of our present
discontents are due to this system of personal Government, which has displaced
collective Cabinet responsibility. I believe that this system has been able to grow
up only by means of this Cabinet Secretariat.^6

In the course of the debate, lesser grievances were added to the
Opposition's bill of particulars - including the expense of maintaining the
Secretariat - but the focus of criticism remained upon the agency which it
seemingly provided to enable Lloyd George and, to a lesser extent, his
colleagues to evade the pre-war mechanisms of parliamentary scrutiny
and accountability. In response, Austen Chamberlain defended the
Secretariat and the administrative methods which stood in marked
contrast to 'the old unbusinesslike system which nothing but the
comparative simplicity of the matters to be dealt with in those days
rendered possible at all.' Chamberlain countered the points which had
been claimed against the Secretariat: he accepted parliamentary account-
ability for the ministry, which the existence of a Secretariat did not
compromise; he defended the Secretariat's supervision of League of
Nations business, which was not alone a Foreign Office concern; he


```
Crisis 1922 87
```
rejected the notion that Britain had accepted 'prime ministerial govern-
ment.' In sum, the work done at Whitehall Gardens served the Cabinet's
collective responsibility:
So far from the effect of having this record taken being to increase the power of
any individual minister, be it the Prime Minister himself, it is an essential feature
for the preservation of control by the Cabinet as a whole over the general affairs of
the nation. The Cabinet Secretariat has no executive function, has no ad-
ministrative function, displaces no other Department and does the work of no
other Department... they are not themselves authorised to take the initiative in
any matter of administration, in any matter of legislation, or in any matter of
executive action.^7
Such a blanket disclaimer of abuses revealed the considerable gap - not
merely politics - in the perceptions of the role of the Cabinet Secretariat:
its defenders looked alone to tightly denned secretarial functions,
necessitated by modern demands upon government; its critics instead
feared its executive functions and its exercise of influence in undefined
ways. It must be added that the Prime Ministers closest to the changes,
Asquith and Lloyd George, made no attempt to reconcile the divergent
views or to ease the burgeoning acrimony of the exchange. The former
premier refused to credit the need for practices which had not been
required by the likes of Gladstone, Disraeli, and Salisbury, nor by his
own regime:' The system was neither slovenly nor unbusinesslike, nor in
practice, did it lead to misapprehension or confusion.'^8
Even more regrettably, Lloyd George made no attempt to bridge the
gap nor to remove the Secretariat from the harsh glare of politics. The
man most responsible for the new system denied that personal govern-
ment was secured through the agency of an irresponsible department:
'No man who knew anything at all about it could possibly talk like that.
They are a communicating Department, they are a means of transmitting
to Departments the decisions.' Choosing the example of reparations,
Lloyd George contended that the need for co-ordination was self-evident
where half-a-dozen departments were concerned to nearly an equal
degree. But talk of more than a limited function he rejected:c The Cabinet
Secretariat has nothing whatever to do with any question of policy. It is
purely a recording machine... This is a machine which is an
improvement upon the past. It is a machine which, I venture to predict,
no responsible Minister, when he has got the chance, will cast away.'
Throughout his speech, Lloyd George took the offensive against his
critics, and at its conclusion he inflamed the debate by linking ' the good
old dignified ways' to 'the cataract of 1914': 'the world wants a change
from the old methods. I am making no comment upon any particular
Minister or otherwise - I am simply contrasting one system with
another.'^9 In this sense, Lloyd George tied the Cabinet Secretariat to his


```
88 A man and an institution
```
' system'; of course, he was correct, but whether he was wise is another
matter. If the institution were to survive his own regime, other men
would have to disentangle it from his personal methods of governing.
Hankey had good reason to be disappointed with the nature of Lloyd
George's defence, since he had briefed the premier - as he had Curzon on
an earlier occasion; the premier had clearly exceeded that brief in
warming to the challenge mounted by the Opposition, which predictably
lost its parliamentary appeal.^10
The bulk of Lloyd George's remarks was derived from a memorandum
which Hankey had prepared for him; the Cabinet Secretary had eschewed
contentious references to past practices, arguing instead that there was no
analogy whatever between pre-war and post-war governmental res-
ponsibilities: as inter-departmental problems now constantly arose,
there was need for careful co-ordination of the activities of many
departments. How much more apt are his concluding sentiments than
those with which Lloyd George inflamed the debate:

The Cabinet is a Committee in continuous session to which are brought from day
to day the most baffling and perplexing problems... the solution of which
requires the most carefully concerted action between a number of Departments
and authorities. Surely then the Cabinet is entitled in the present arduous times to
such Secretarial assistance as its members require and as experience has shown to
be necessary.^11

Hankey's common sense approach possessed merit: surely the members
of the Cabinet should themselves decide how their business was to be
carried on -what had sufficed for Gladstone and Disraeli need not dictate
the patterns for their successors.
In the wake of the parliamentary exchange, the press examined the
Cabinet Secretariat even more closely, although not necessarily more
accurately. Thus The Spectator, an outspoken opponent of the Lloyd
George regime, criticized Hankey's operation for failing effectively to
define the government's policy:

We cannot recall a time when policy was as shifting and as incalculable as it is now.
It is never the same from day to day. There are unceasing adaptations,
accommodations, surrenders. The Government say that they will never consent
to something or other and within a few days they consent. The Secretariat, we are
told, is necessary to bring clarity to the work of the Government, but what we see
is not clarity but confusion.^12
Clarity of policy demanded certainty of purpose on the Cabinet's part; for
a Secretariat to impose a contrived unanimity upon a divided coalition
would have required the office to function in ways which its critics
decried. Yet The Spectator would not accept the contention that the
Secretariat was only a record-keeping body: if that were its purpose, the
journal reasoned, then 'surely some member of the Cabinet could be


```
Crisis 1922 89
```
trusted to jot down in ten or twenty lines the decision reached. The record
could then be countersigned by the Cabinet, or by the Prime Minister
acting on behalf of the Cabinet, when the minute had been read out.'
Such a technique would surely have often re-opened discussion, and
Cabinet business as a result may never have been concluded, let alone the
decisions implemented. For the most part, press notice duplicated
criticism voiced in the Commons; in one case, an MP, Sir Henry Craik,
reiterated in the debate what he had already written about, at great length
in the June issue of Nineteenth Century. Admitting that past practices
could not bulwark a case against the Secretariat, Craik feared that
Secretariat officials would become major figures of state^13 and endanger
the balance of Cabinet government: 'And is it not quite possible that in
this new and very powerful machinery an ambitious Prime Minister
might find a very convenient instrument by which to exercise an
authority in even wider spheres, to issue ukases to the Press, and to
manipulate to his own purposes the stream of public opinion?^514 Despite a
disclaimer, this cloth was cut to the figure of David Lloyd George. In
some quarters, constitutional questions were raised in the name of
preserving traditional ways: for example, the editors of the Law Times
found a structural flaw in the new arrangements: 'The presence of a
stranger at a Cabinet meeting divests that meeting of its character as a
meeting of the Cabinet, having regard to the oath of a Privy Councillor,
by which the obligation of secrecy is imposed as to what happens in the
Cabinet.'^15 The point does not impress as a weighty one - Cabinet secrecy
had if anything been strengthened through its administration - and one
wonders if there were no better constitutional case to be made.
More telling was the argument centering on the size and expense of the
Secretariat, especially since the period had been marked by government
economies; Hankey had already responded to such pressures, reducing
both items from the 1921-2 levels. Maclean had questioned the number
required for a record-keeping operation, and the press was even less kind
to 'Hankey's Beauty Chorus,'^16 numbering in addition to its principals
some forty-seven clerks, twenty-two typists, twenty messengers and
fourteen charwomen. The Weekly Dispatch was at least novel in
explaining the last contingent: 'Three competent officials could do all
that is required. The others are writing unnecessary minutes and
memoranda, which explains the need for 14 charwomen.'^17 Even
George V drew the line at charwomen and excessive numbers, although
he left no doubt of his preference for 'the modern Cabinet system with
a secretariat.' Oddly, only the curmudgeonly Treasury expressed its
assurance that such numbers were required for the operations of the
Cabinet Office.^18
Hankey had conveyed to Lloyd George the information that the


90 A man and an institution

Secretariat had prepared the agenda for, taken, and circulated the minutes
of some ninety-three Cabinet meetings in 1921, as well as servicing the
meetings of fifty-three Conferences of Ministers, twenty-two meetings of
the Home Affairs Committee, seven of the Finance Committee and one
hundred and sixty-four meetings of various other Cabinet committees. In
the month of January 1922 the Cabinet Office supplied the Secretariats
for four major conferences - the Irish, another at Cannes, the Washing-
ton Naval and the meeting of the Council of the League of Nations.
'Three men' would have been stretched rather thin! And as well a case
could be made for the numbers involved in 'Hankey's Beauty Chorus':

Throughout the [inter-war] period the ratio of subordinate to senior staff was
high, and is largely explained by two factors: first, in the interests of security a
good deal of clerical work was involved in recording the distribution and
whereabouts of papers; and secondly, as many matters tended to reach the Office
when they were at crisis point, a margin of staff had to be available to handle
urgent work by day and by night, particularly in the duplication of papers and in
their prompt dispatch to the recipients.^19

```
The calm elaboration of such practical concerns could well have eased the
criticisms directed towards the Secretariat, but Lloyd George chose to do
otherwise.
```
```
More problematic throughout the 1922 collapse of the regime was the
continued close relationship with the Prime Minister's Secretariat, which
had over the years caused Hankey concern. The Downing Street
' irregulars' remained highly visible, in marked contrast to the precepts
proclaimed in the less frenetic environs of Whitehall Gardens, as
subsequently enunciated by Hankey's deputy, Tom Jones: 'The Private
Secretary does not seek public power, he nurses instead a passion for
anonymity and secret influence. He would be horrified to see anything
attributed to his own initiative.'^20 Yet the Prime Minister's Secretariat
remained a part of Lloyd George's post-war modus operandi?^1 and
Hankey had no choice but to co-operate with it: he tacitly acknowledged
the role which the premier had assigned to Philip Kerr in the formulation
of foreign policy by reporting to him concerning a conversation which he
had had with the Italian statesman Sforza.^22 Kerr had come into his own
as an adviser to Lloyd George during the Paris Peace Conference, and
thereafter his reports were frequent but by no means sinister, and no
attempt to undermine the role of the Foreign Office is in evidence.^23
Confronted with a health problem, Kerr concluded in early 1921 that the
post-war work which Lloyd George had asked him to undertake was
finished, and he thought the same might be said for the work of the Prime
Minister's Secretariat:
```

```
Crisis 1922 91
```
As to my successor, I cannot find anybody with quite my experience... unless
you have someone else in mind, I rather think the best plan is to close the
Secretariat altogether, economy!!! and divide its functions between Hankey's
office and J. T. [Davies]. The Cabinet Office is really your Secretariat and has all
the knowledge and experience I can supply. And the other work, now that you
have drawn out of the active management of Foreign Affairs, can I think be done
by an intelligent Private Secretary under J. T. Davies.^24
Kerr remained on until May, but Lloyd George disregarded his advice
and kept the Prime Minister's Secretariat, now headed by Sir Edward
Grigg (later Lord Altrincham). Even from without Downing Street, Kerr
continued to discharge an advisory role,^25 a strong indication that for the
premier it was not the institution which mattered but instead the men
around him and the ways in which he could put them to good use.
In the first post-war years, the advisers in Downing Street functioned
as they had in the war, discharging tasks which Frances Stevenson has
described as ' a great deal of preliminary work in arriving at decisions...
beforehand sift [ing] the facts and preparing] memoranda and often
convey [ing] messages from him to his Ministers. Such procedure was
most distasteful to some Ministers who preferred the old-fashioned
etiquette.'^26 In particular, as noted earlier, Curzon and the Foreign Office
disliked intensely the goings-on at No. 10, although they extended a
grudging tolerance to the counterpart Cabinet Secretariat, to some
degree compromised by Hankey's tendency to become 'secretary of
everything that mattered.'^27 In the Prime Minister's Secretariat, Grigg
took up where Kerr had not quite left off: he paid close attention to the
press and tackled a range of detailed tasks which were hardly the stuff of
epic policy-making; he did play an advisory role in several spheres of
foreign policy, including both the Near East and the daunting question of
an extension of the Anglo-Japanese alliance.^28 Grigg was very much his
master's servant, but the Prime Minister's Secretariat never won any
standing with the departments, precisely because Lloyd George used the
institution to fend off ministers intent on dealing with the Prime Minister
himself.^29 In addition, the Prime Minister's Secretariat recruited 'out-
siders' with a relative lack of knowledge of the internal workings of what
is called 'British Central Government.'^30 The Cabinet Secretariat had
brought a similar war-time recruitment policy much more into line with
orthodox procedures, but Hankey's steady attendance at foreign con-
ferences continued to blur the distinction between the two bodies.
Yet it is difficult to credit the extraordinary degree of journalistic
confusion alone to misapprehension: to assert in 1922 that the Cabinet
Secretariat was otherwise known as the 'Garden Suburb'^31 required
malice, rather than ignorance. With Beaverbrook in pursuit of Hankey,


92 A man and an institution

the Daily Express merged the Cabinet Secretariat with the 'Downing-
street Garden City' and questioned 'why its members are still retained to
do work which many people think was just as efficiently done before the
war without them.'^32 The Cabinet Office file of press clippings bulges
with cases of mistaken identity, most reflecting unfavorably upon its
work, but a few editors saw through the welter of confusion. The Glasgow
Herald properly viewed Lloyd George's system in terms of institutional
evolution: 'the introduction of the new [Cabinet Secretariat] system
during the war, by an Act of the Executive, illustrates at once the
flexibility of the British constitution, and our national preference for the
reception of innovations as accomplished facts rather than as theories.'^33
Precisely because the Opposition lacked a constitutional case against the
' accomplished facts,' they chose' to pose as champions of the authority of
the House against an ambitious minister.' Above all else, both Secre-
tariats owed their existence to Lloyd George - and opinions passed on his
leadership reflected on them - although insiders knew enough to
distinguish between the two. By 1922 an MP, Field-Marshal Sir Henry
Wilson, knew both operations well, and he noted in his diary after leaving
the debate: ' I could have knocked Lloyd George and his quibbles [sic]
with ease, but not without using my inside knowledge, which I did not
think was fair. The truth, of course, being that Hankey and his Secretariat
are essential, whereas Philip Kerr, Ned Grigg, etc., are poisonous.'^34
Such a view of the Downing Street operation is exaggerated - in light of
the historical evidence - but the Cabinet Secretariat had shortly to share
with its counterpart the fruits of that 'poison,' which for a time looked
very nearly fatal.

```
In the meantime, how well had the Cabinet Secretariat served its primary
function, the maintenance of a record-keeping apparatus for Cabinet
government? Certainly the casual but widespread leakage of Cabinet
business had been stemmed with the reforms of December 1916; not until
1920 did the Cabinet again take notice of what were described as minor
leakages to the press, cautioning 'all persons engaged in publicity on
behalf of the Government' that no publication of Cabinet business could
be arranged without prior ministerial approval. Nor was this alone a
matter of the Prime Minister's Secretariat, as Hankey explained: ' So
many Departments nowadays have publicity sections of their own that
leakage is much more likely than in the past. The publicity departments,
in order to secure a good press, must be strongly impelled to com-
municate information and I think that this is one source of leakage.'^35
However, ministers were not beyond fault, Hankey added, as on one past
occasion he had located the source of a leak in a Cabinet Minister
' attacked by journalists in Downing Street itself on leaving a Meeting.' In
```

```
Crisis 1922 93
```
his own operation, Hankey had determined to sever all connections with
the press, a policy incorporated in 'a standing office order dated
December 7, 1921 which lays down that no member of the Cabinet
Secretariat Staff is to give interviews or official information of any kind to
representatives of the Press in any circumstances whatever.'^36 Clearly,
Hankey's hope was to keep the Secretariat beyond even the suspicion of
consorting with the press.
In November 1920, the Cabinet Minutes recorded 'a scandalous
instance of leakage in editions of the Press issued comparatively early in
the afternoon of the previous day, of information regarding the discussion
of the Cabinet on the same morning on the subject of Russia, some
indication having been given even of the views expressed by individual
ministers.'^37 No one could flaw secretarial procedures in this case,
because at the Prime Minister's instruction the minutes of this conten-
tious meeting had been drafted so as to reveal no details of individual
views; even in that fashion, they had not been circulated until well after
the papers involved had gone to press. The guilty parties - and there
could not have been much doubt about their identities - were duly
cautioned to exercise' the utmost reticence' along with their colleagues in
commenting about Cabinet business.
A little more than a year later, another leakage led to a re-ordering of
Secretariat procedures: at a Cabinet meeting on 8 March 1922, the
Minister of Labour, Macnamara, complained that proposals which he had
earlier presented to the Cabinet had appeared in some detail in the press on
the previous day; Churchill, Secretary of State for the Colonies, noted that
' practically the very words he had used in the [Cabinet] discussion in
regard to Russian relief had also been quoted; the Prime Minister
himself observed that the first notice of the topics for this Cabinet
meeting had come not from the agenda paper but instead from the daily
press.^38 Here was unequivocal evidence that several Cabinet documents
had fallen into - or been placed in - the hands of the press, and the
Cabinet inquired whether the Secretariat could reduce the numbers of
Cabinet papers in circulation, particularly those sent to ministers outside
the Cabinet. Hankey attempted to reduce the volume and to restrain the
flow of such materials, although the restriction did not prove long-term.^39
At this time, the Cabinet also resolved upon a much more stringent
circulation of Cabinet Conclusions, which placed complete copies only in
the hands of the King and the Prime Minister, with another in the custody
of the Secretary; as a result, Hankey had to write personal letters to every
minister who had either to implement a Cabinet decision or take it into
account - perhaps twenty such letters.^40 This curtailed pattern of vital
information remained in effect for the balance of the coalition's existence.
The great value of preserving the confidentiality of Cabinet proceed-


```
94 A man and an institution
```
ings is evident in an incident which involved disagreement within the
Coalition Cabinet in July 1922. Lloyd George authorized the Secretary to
make a full note of the discussion, including specific reference to dissent
from several ministers; Austen Chamberlain protested the practice,
which ' appeared to him to be at variance with the constitutional rule that
ministers were corporatively responsible for all Cabinet decisions.'
Arthur Balfour countered that such a convention was rooted in 'the
importance of preserving an unbroken phalanx in the face of the public
and ... he did not consider that it was infringed by the confidential
record of a dissent.' Chamberlain quickly deferred to his colleague's
'high authority and long experience,'^41 and such important records of
dissent - revealing the dynamics of Cabinet government - surface on
occasion in the Cabinet records;^42 unintentionally, they serve to inform
history, which is indebted to the Secretariat's protection of the con-
fidentiality which ensured freedom of discussion.
The achievements of the Cabinet Secretariat do not address the
question which troubled Lloyd George's contemporaries in 1922, namely
whether the two bodies primarily served the Prime Minister's personal
ends. 'Prime ministerial government' was objectionable enough in many
quarters, but the announcement in August 1922 that the Prime Minister
intended to write his war memoirs 'by way of reply to the criticism of his
direction of the war which were constantly appearing in articles,
pamphlets and books'^43 likely reinforced suspicions concerning the use of
the Secretariats in such a venture: how else could an incumbent premier
accomplish such a daunting project? Though Lloyd George's anger was
genuine, a direct response to what he regarded as the misstatements and
lies found in the war memoirs of' Wully' Robertson and his ilk, some of
those close to him advised against such an activity while holding office.^44
Along with the misrepresentations in the popular press, the climate of
suspicion which gripped British politics in 1922 must be taken into
account in any understanding of the Cabinet Secretariat's difficulties.
Why such a parliamentarian as Sir Henry Craik should fear for the
continuity of personnel in Whitehall Gardens with a change in regimes is
otherwise inexplicable, but, in contrast to departmental civil servants,
Craik found them

```
a body of officers, who have shared the most confidential secrets of one body of
ministers, and who be called in turn to share equal confidences with another body
of ministers fundamentally differing in regard to every political principle. Even to
the well-trained adaptability of our civil servants this transference of service and
of intimate confidence must surely present some difficulty.^45
Nor did Craik have much confidence that a new government could resist
using the ' candid records' of a predecessor regime in a partisan fashion.
Ironic that a staunch defender of parliamentary government had so little
```

```
Crisis 1922 95
```
```
trust in the men who governed, politicians and civil servants alike, but
such was the climate of 1922. The Westminster Gazette, a staunch Liberal
journal, asserted flatly that 'no Cabinet will be willing to go forward with
the secretariat of its predecessor.'^46
In this hostile light, little if any regard was paid to the contention that
the new system was required to cope with the gathering pace and
complexity of twentieth-century government. Certainly Lloyd George
intended to centralize governmental power in his office, and both the War
Cabinet and the Cabinet Secretariat were devices to overcome the
departmentalism of the old order. Yet to combat departmentalism is
not necessarily to overthrow the Cabinet's collective responsibility.^47
However, as a result of the winning war effort mounted by his regime and
```
- it must be added - the premier's instinct for the limelight, he stood head
    and shoulders above his Cabinet colleagues. By reputation towering
    above all rivals - even as the political base of his coalition eroded - Lloyd
    George utilized the Cabinet Secretariat to serve his unorthodox, idiosyn-
    cratic ways of resolving government business. The point remains that the
    premier had not attained his domination of the Coalition Cabinet through
    the use of the Secretariat to undercut his colleagues; rather, his strength
    and stature enabled him to use the Secretariat as he did: 'There is no
    doubt... that in the last analysis the Cabinet Secretariat was an
    auxiliary rather than an agent of power.' Hankey pointed to a mechanism
    which militated against the premier's use of the Secretariat to arrogate
    power from his colleagues:' If anything, the Secretariat would seem to act
    as a check upon individual action, as it is its duty to communicate the
    decision to the minister who is called upon to act. '^48 As had been endlessly
    repeated, the Cabinet Secretariat had no executive functions, but Lloyd
    George's role, and his influence, could not be so neatly confined.
    Whatever mechanistic explanations were offered, the association of
    premier and institution remained: in its inception and development, the
    Cabinet Secretariat was so much a part of Lloyd George's' system' that it
    could not escape criticisms directed at his policies, his practices, or his
    person.
       In sum, the entire question of Lloyd George's 'presidential' style of
    government has very little directly to do with the functions of the Cabinet
    Secretariat. Yet that style has been so widely commented upon that the
    connection cannot be altogether eschewed. Several observations seem to
    be in order. Even those who contest the concept of the development of
    prime ministerial ' Caesarism' admit that the Lloyd George regime was
    an exception: Ian Gilmour, for example, depicts the Welsh radical
    launching the only attempt to increase the powers resident in Downing
    Street between the time of Salisbury and Churchill; to achieve such an
    end, he had to protect himself from the specialist preoccupations of all


96 A man and an institution

government departments. Thus 'the Cabinet Office has not pushed the
Prime Minister far ahead of the field; it has enabled him to keep up with it,
to retain the place he formerly held. Without a Cabinet Office, a Prime
Minister would be at the mercy of the Departments.'^49 Certainly the
trend to specialization has accelerated since Lloyd George's time, but
departmentalism was undoubtedly a force which he had to take into
account and attempt to combat. A second critic of the concept of the
development of' prime ministerial government' acknowledges the direc-
tion of Lloyd George's intention, but Gordon Walker points to his
attempt as an aberration, since decline in the premier's authority ensued.
With the subsequent revival of the concept, Gordon Walker identifies
Attlee and Eden as premiers who took major decisions without full
Cabinet approval. With their actions, the trend resumed, but their
procedures reveal that 'partial Cabinets... not Prime Ministerial
Government, have become an accepted and established part of the
Cabinet system.'^50 In a fashion, the precedent had been established in the
autumn of 1922: although at that time the whole Cabinet decided policy, a
' partial Cabinet' carried the day, and an even smaller group actually was
involved in drafting the communique which proved decisive in the
Chanak crisis. Yet throughout the entire incident Lloyd George worked
within the limits upon 'prime ministerial government' which Gordon
Walker insists remain in place: 'The Prime Minister can exercise his
greatly enhanced powers only if he carries his Cabinet with him.'^51 Lloyd
George managed that; what he lacked was the means to carry the Tory
junior ministers and the back-benchers, whose support was required to
sustain the coalition in power.
In the other camp, those who see the tides of twentieth-century politics
running towards ' prime ministerial government' - Richard Crossman,
John Mackintosh, Frank Stacey, and Humphrey Berkeley among more
recent commentators^52 - do not describe the Cabinet Secretariat as the
agency whereby power has been transferred to Downing Street. Stacey's
description is typical: 'the Cabinet Secretariat has grown steadily in
importance and has helped to enhance the efficiency of the Cabinet, both
as a decision-making body and as a means of co-ordinating the whole
Government machine.'^53 Agreeing that the institution provides a kind of
'mantle' which strengthens politically weaker premiers, they attribute
the development to Lloyd George: he transformed the powers which he
' exercised by virtue of his personality... into an institutional basis by
setting up the Cabinet Office.'^54 Despite the continuing dispute concern-
ing a ' presidential' system, there is general agreement that the Cabinet
Secretariat, in its formative years, did not provide the means by which
Lloyd George won accretions of power at the expense of the traditional
collective responsibility of the Cabinet. The point is speculative, but with-


```
Crisis 1922 97
```
out the Cabinet Office Lloyd George's successors might well have been
harder pressed to lead their regimes, lacking as they did the personal
dynamism of the Welsh maverick. There is a massive if seldom remarked-
upon irony in his making possible a more highly centralized and efficient
government for his less persuasive successors, several of whom decried the
system which he had forged. The difference remains: Lloyd George's
approach to a' presidential' system was the threat of one individual;^55 the
subsequent threat consists instead in the weight of bureaucratic centraliz-
ation vested in the office. Nonetheless, it must be said of Lloyd George
that he had given the office a different working relationship vis-a-vis the
Cabinet, but throughout his tenure the Cabinet remained - as was its
right - the most important body which he consulted; indeed, it is clear
that he had to carry the Cabinet with him in order to make what his critics
called his 'personal' policy.^56
In March 1922, one former member of the Coalition Cabinet
denounced the premier's flaunting of collective responsibility: Edwin
Montagu, Secretary of State for India since 1917, had published -
without consulting the Cabinet - a telegram from the Viceroy criticizing
the Cabinet for favoring Greek interests in Asia Minor and Con-
stantinople. Montagu had acted on his own in order to quiet Moslem
alarm in India. In the ensuing furor over his action, Montagu resigned his
office; he had little choice, because Austen Chamberlain had dissociated
the Cabinet from an action taken on a minister's sole responsibility.^57
Montagu reacted bitterly to his colleagues' censure by attacking Lloyd
George:

an accusation of a breach of the doctrine of Cabinet responsibility from the Prime
Minister, of all men in the world, is a laughable accusation... The head of
Government... has demanded the price which is within the power of every
genius to demand - and that price has been the total, complete, absolute
disappearance of the doctrine of Cabinet responsibility ever since he formed his
Government.^58

Montagu was technically in the wrong for acting as he had, although he
was angered that the technicality was but a pretext for his removal, as
Lloyd George sought to appease the Tory' Die-hards' in forcing him out;
as for invoking the concept of collective responsibility against him,
Montagu was stunned:' The wizard... from his cupboard where he has
locked his doctrine, brings it out conveniently and makes me the victim of
this new creed... Cabinet responsibility.'^59 The Cabinet displayed no
sympathy for his action, nor, more important, for his criticism of the
premier. In an informal discussion presided over by Austen Chamberlain
during a suspension of a Cabinet meeting, senior Cabinet ministers
agreed that despite regular Cabinet meetings, much more of its work was
carried on by Cabinet committees; Balfour thought that 'the whole


###### 98 A man and an institution

###### machine is worked harder than formerly.' Drawing upon his long

###### experience, he defended Lloyd George's activism: 'All Prime Ministers

###### in my time have been charged either with being figure-heads run by abler

###### men or tyrants. There has never been a middle position.' Chamberlain

###### added that the Prime Minister had been careful in putting Cabinet

###### members of divergent views on Cabinet committees, apparently conclud-

###### ing that such a practice dictated against his dominating those committees

###### or excluding proper deliberation. In sum, the Cabinet informally scoffed

###### at the accusation brought against the system of government, namely that,

###### in Chamberlain's phrase, it embodied 'autocracy tempered by dis-

###### organisation.'^60 Perhaps more concerned than the Cabinet, Hankey

###### pursued the matter, inquiring privately of Balfour whether he discerned

###### less collective responsibility in the present Cabinet than in its pre-

###### decessors: 'He absolutely scouted the idea that the sense of Cabinet

###### responsibility is any less now.'^61 The political crisis of autumn 1922

###### brought to the fore the question of how the Cabinet would discharge its

###### collective responsibility; by that time Hankey's concerns were with the

###### survival of the Cabinet Secretariat, midst the wreckage of the Lloyd

###### George system of government.

###### Even before the dust had settled at the Carlton Club, Hankey shared with

###### Tom Jones his thoughts on how the Cabinet Office would have to adapt to

###### the fall of the coalition: 'Thinks drastic reduction of staff inevitable...

###### The first thing to be shed will be our responsibility for foreign

###### conferences. This will go to the Foreign Office. Next we will shed our

###### relations with the League of Nations. Next restrict as far as possible our

###### responsibilities for committees.'^62 On that same afternoon, Lloyd George

###### commented: 'Hankey, you have written your last Minutes for me,' but

###### not until the next day did he assure the Cabinet Secretary that he should

###### remain on to serve Bonar Law, insisting that 'he would never allow

###### anything to pass that would embarrass me in my loyalty to my new

##### chief.'^63 Although Hankey did not hesitate to sever his official relation-

###### ship, his actions leave no doubt that a genuine personal affection

###### survived. His emotions rarely surfaced, save in his diary, but he

###### permitted himself a strong expression in inviting, some months later, the

###### the Cabinet Secretary warmed to a man from whom he was temper-

###### amentally very different.^66 Above all else, however, Lloyd George had


```
Crisis 1922 99
```
gotten the j ob done - in war to greater purpose than in peace - and Hankey,
time would reveal, did not again encounter his like.
The immediate concern for Hankey and the Secretariat lay in the need
to accommodate to a Prime Minister who was very different from his
predecessor; in fact, his success in that office depended in part upon his
ability to differentiate his style of government from the coalition. Yet
Bonar Law had himself been an important figure in that regime, until his
own resignation - for reasons of health - in March 1921; indeed, he had
been in the chair at the third meeting of the War Cabinet, in those distant
days in 1916, at which time the distribution of the Cabinet Minutes had
been decided upon.^67 Would four years of service as Lloyd George's loyal
second dispose him favorably to the reforms of that period? Or would his
new Cabinet colleagues, men who for the most part had rejected Lloyd
George's lead, prevail upon him to discard the new machinery of
government, as they had removed its founder?
The initial signals of his attitude were ambivalent, but throughout
Hankey showed a determination to salvage the Secretariat in a struggle
which he had to wage on two fronts: in the political arena, he had to win
Law's support for the Secretariat; in the institutional setting, he had to
withstand what amounted to a take-over bid from Sir Warren Fisher,
Permanent Secretary to the Treasury, who wanted to absorb the
Secretariat within his own central department of government. The
survival of an independent Cabinet Secretariat was by no means assured,
and Hankey's handling of its defence impresses as masterful, given the
strong current running against Lloyd George's 'system.' As noted, he
was very much aware of the institution's vulnerability, confirmed at a
gathering in the Guildhall on 20 October, when' several people asked me
half chaffingly whether I had resigned and alluded to "superfluous"
officials.' Directly he secured Lloyd George's approval to place the
Secretariat at Law's disposal, while he was still forming his Cabinet.
Hankey secured an interview with the Tory leader, and he drew up ' a list
of the really urgent questions before the Cabinet on which he could not
long defer a decision.' Hankey worded the note carefully, taking
particular care not to assume that there would be a Cabinet Secretary, let
alone his continuing in the post.^68 In contrast to his willingness to help,
Hankey discerned a move from his opponents when he learned that' the
usual batch of Foreign Office telegrams' had not been sent to his office:
' This looked ominous, as I had read in the newspaper that Lord Curzon
had been seeing Bonar Law, and it rather looked as though this was a sign
that the insistent and much repeated newspaper stories were true and that
they had decided to scrap the Cabinet Secretariat.' Yet it transpired that
Lord Curzon had stopped the entire Cabinet circulation at a time when
'there was practically no Cabinet,' and the Permanent Under-Secretary


##### ioo A man and an institution

##### immediately arranged to send the usual papers through to the Cabinet

Office.

##### Despite the false alarm, Hankey decided to yield gracefully to the

Foreign Office what would otherwise likely be summarily taken, although

###### he reasoned that in so acting he would immediately effect' big economies'

##### in expenditure. Thus he informed the Permanent Under-Secretary, Sir

##### Eyre Crowe, that he would propose to Law that

###### the League of Nations section should be handed over to the Foreign Office, and

##### ... that the Cabinet Secretariat should drop out of all International Conferences.

##### I pointed out that I had long favoured both courses, as he knew, and that it was

##### Lloyd George and Balfour who had always insisted on my doing this work. I also

recalled that in fact I had never interfered with the advisory functions of his office,

##### and had never had any quarrel with him or the Foreign Office in fulfilling my

##### secretarial functions, but I thought that in principle it was only right that for the

##### future he should undertake both functions.^69

Not surprisingly, Crowe agreed to absorb these activities,' even if they did

##### not at first do them so well.' Hankey found Crowe very complimentary;

nonetheless, one wonders if the Permanent Under-Secretary credited the

##### entire conversation, given Hankey's involvement - whether or not

##### voluntary - in past incursions upon Foreign Office preserves. For his

##### part, Hankey turned to the main business at hand, namely Bonar Law's

##### attitude, calling upon him at his home:

##### he asked me point blank if I was prepared to serve him as loyally as I had served

##### Lloyd George. I replied that, if he wanted me, I would serve him as loyally as I

had served Asquith and Lloyd George and that the latter was quite prepared that

###### I should do so.' That is the answer I had expected', he said,' and you can help me

##### at once because your experience in these [constitutional] matters is unique.'

###### [Subsequently, Hankey asked him] point blank if he intended to have a Cabinet

##### Secretariat or to scrap it. He at once replied that he intended to continue the

##### system of recording Cabinet conclusions, which he thought essential to busi-

##### nesslike procedure. But he thought it essential that the cost should be curtailed. I

##### said I would work out the plans for this, if he would decide the broad lines, and I

##### could suggest the lines to him in three minutes.^70

##### With Stanley Baldwin joining in the conversation, Hankey outlined the

##### abandonment of Foreign Office business and proposed some personnel

##### cuts on the Cabinet side of the office business, which his new masters

###### thought' a great help.' On such a positive note Hankey took his leave after

##### informing Law and Baldwin that he could give them ' a defence' against

##### criticism of the Secretariat.

##### Yet the crisis was far from over, although the Cabinet Secretary

##### immediately set about csave[ing] the ship by chucking ballast overboard'

##### in implementing the economies promised to Bonar Law: he found the

##### business of sacking some of his assistants 'very trying,' although one

##### individual took the action so unpleasantly that the Secretary did not after


```
Crisis 1922 101
```
all regret his departure.^71 Hankey was particularly anxious to retain Tom
Jones, having raised the matter at his meeting with Law. Clouds
continued to gather round the Cabinet Office, as Hankey noted in his
diary on 25 October:

I have been fighting all day with my back to the wall for my position. I am up
against the whole hierarchy of the civil service, who have taken advantage of
Lloyd George's fall to try and down me. Luckily their representative was Warren
Fisher, a personal friend and a gentleman. I think I have succeeded in retaining all
essentials.

The Cabinet Secretary took the care to dictate a fuller account of these
proceedings which exposes the inadequacy of this diary entry.^72 Far from
acting as a representative of an irate Civil Service, Fisher is depicted as
intent upon incorporating the Secretariat within the Treasury: after the
initial skirmish with Fisher, Hankey learned from Law that his statement
of the principles for the re-organization did not ' quite conform' with
Fisher's understanding of the arrangements which he had struck with the
Cabinet Secretary at that meeting.^73 Hankey was taken aback when Law
asked him to agree on a' formula' for the status of the Cabinet Secretariat,
so that he might make reference to it in an address scheduled for Glasgow
on the 26th. The dispute centered on the status of the office: Hankey
wished to regain its position 'under the War Cabinet system, when it
appeared for parliamentary scrutiny on the general vote of the Treasury'

- as had been the case until 1921 - but Fisher had looked to its becoming
'in effect ... a branch of the Treasury.'^74
    When Fisher and Hankey sat down for another discussion, the Cabinet
Secretary protested what he described as the 'planting' of 'a scheme of
this kind (which, he afterwards admitted) had been maturing for a long
time without talking it over beforehand.'^75 He learned that the Cabinet
    Secretary would be quite unaffected in his work under Fisher's scheme,
as he would retain direct access to the Prime Minister, but Fisher would
not guarantee that his successors would accept such a special arrange-
ment. Even more pressing for Hankey was the status of his office in the
eyes of the Whitehall community, politicians, and civil servants alike:

the prestige of the post of Secretary of the Cabinet and Committee of Imperial
Defence would be largely lost and... the Secretary's position with other
Departments would be seriously weakened if they regarded him as they would be
entitled to regard him, merely as a Treasury official. Cases often arose where the
Treasury was in conflict with other Departments and these were brought to the
Cabinet or the Committee of Imperial Defence, and the Cabinet Secretary,
though possessing no advisory duties, ought to be entirely unbiassed.

```
With careful argumentation, Hankey persuaded Balfour - whose counsel
he sought, although Balfour was no longer in the Cabinet - that such a
```

```
102 A man and an institution
```
position was unacceptable, and the elder statesman advised him that,
should Fisher press his point, Hankey should resign as Cabinet Secretary
but remain on as Secretary of the CID. Returning to the fray with
Warren Fisher, Hankey again heard the latter's view that' the Treasury is
the central Department of the Government and for that reason he
considered it essential as part of Treasury control (though he did not like
the word) that the Cabinet Secretariat should become an integral part of
the Treasury.' In reply, Hankey admitted that such an approach 'might
or might not be logically defensible and if he was starting a Cabinet
Secretariat afresh as a new scheme, it might or might not be the right way
to do it.' Yet in reality Hankey's own experience mattered, and he had run
the office in an autonomous fashion. He would not undertake to run it in
Fisher's fashion; without attaching undue importance to matters of form,
Hankey claimed he could not function effectively without' that shred of
prestige that attached to a semi-autonomous position.' He might have
used stronger if less personal language, for it is clear that Hankey looked
to the Cabinet, not to the Treasury, as his masters.
The thrust of Hankey's admitted 'personal appeal' went home:
Fisher agreed to concede what Hankey desired, although he considered
the fate of the Cabinet Office after Hankey quite a different matter. Thus
the two administrators hammered out a proposed statement for Bonar
Law:
Part of the work of the Cabinet Secretariat is being distributed among other
Government Departments. I have already given orders for all work connected
with the League of Nations and International Conferences to be handed over to
the Foreign Office. The remaining secretarial work required by the Cabinet and
the Committee of Imperial Defence will be retransferred to the Treasury vote.
Though ' retransferred' impresses as a curious turn of phrase, Hankey
deliberately resorted to it instead of the word which Fisher had sought to
use, namely 'transferral.' The Cabinet Secretary sought to underscore
the reversion to the position which had operated prior to the Cabinet
Secretariat's separate parliamentary vote, which dated only to March

1921.^76 Such a mechanism would create the 'semi-autonomous' status
which he sought for the Cabinet Office, even if it involved the ' foster-
parentage ' of the Treasury.
Yet the struggle was not yet over, because Bonar Law's Glasgow
speech displayed a hostility to the size and the autonomy of the Cabinet
Secretariat:
We [the Cabinet] have decided to bring the Cabinet Secretariat in its present form
to an end (Cheers.) Now that does not mean that everything connected with it has
got to go. I wish to make that quite plain... There are two things which we must
retain, and I believe honestly that no man who has tried both systems will have
any doubts about it. We must have an agenda at our meetings, and we must have a


```
Crisis 1922 103
```
definite record of our decisions... But there is no need, I am sure, of the big
body, which I believe was necessary during the war and immediately after it, but
which can come to an end now. I am convinced that the work can be done as
efficiently, and far more economically, by having the Cabinet Secretary... and
whatever help he needs treated as part of the Treasury, which is the central
department of government.^77

Bonar Law noted the assumption of some Secretariat responsibilities by
the Foreign Office, which would realize economies and, more important,
encourage a resumption of traditional patterns in the conduct of foreign
affairs. The speech caused Hankey grievous disappointment, not only
with the Prime Minister's failure to stress the ' retransfer' arrangements
contrived with Fisher but also with the tenor of his campaign oratory:

He had managed to convey the impression that we were to be absorbed into the
body of the Treasury, which was exactly what I wished to avoid. Moreover he had
omitted to do what I had begged him to do, and to say something which would
make clear that we had in fact not encroached on other Departments, and had
done our work efficiently and well. In fact, as Lord Esher said in a telegram he had
conveyed the impression that all the allegations against the office were true.^78
Hankey pursued his dissatisfaction with Warren Fisher, proposing an
inquiry to settle the question of the Secretariat's role: 'I could not
honourably or loyally accept the new post until I had removed the stain
from the office in regard to my previous administration.' After consider-
ing the request, Fisher refused to agree: 'There was no precedent in the
case of the civil service, and there were many precedents to the contrary.
Civil servants were supposed to be anonymous, and it was their business
to put up with attacks until Ministers defended them in Parliament.'^79
Finessing the point that in this case the attack came from a minister -
indeed the first minister - Fisher suggested that in lieu of an inquiry he
accept a statement made in Parliament refuting such charges; Hankey
temporized, but the Permanent Secretary continued with what Hankey
thought an ' extraordinary' proposal,

```
that in addition to continuing [as Secretary of the Cabinet and CID] I should also
become Clerk of the Privy Council - practically a sinecure. The post will shortly
be vacant as Sir Almeric Fitzroy, the present Clerk, has been convicted of
bothering women in the [Hyde] Park, and even if he wins his appeal, will probably
have to retire. The proposal of course eases everything. The Cabinet [is]
constitutionally a Committee of the Privy Council, as the C.I.D. is of the Cabinet.
The whole arrangement is symmetrical and logical, but one that I have often
thought of. Fisher then astonished me by saying it had been in his mind
throughout.^80
With good reason, the Cabinet Secretary thought the proposal a volte face
on Warren Fisher's part, and he disbelieved the latter's claim to have had
such a scheme long in mind; instead, Hankey thought that his demand for
an inquiry had placed the Treasury and Bonar Law 'in a cleft stick': 'If
```

```
104 A m<m and an institution
```
```
they granted an impartial inquiry, I should get such a flaming report that
everyone would say - " Why on earth did you abolish it? " If they refused
an inquiry people would say they were afraid of it.' Hankey recorded in
his diary that Fisher did not dispute his comparison of the war-time
achievements of the Cabinet Secretariat to the utter failure of the central
department of government, the Treasury:
It had shown neither foresight nor imagination nor organising capacity, and had
plunged the country into something like administrative chaos until the War
Cabinet machine came to the rescue. This he did not dispute, and even
strengthened what I said. He must have realised that if I developed this case
before an impartial tribunal the Treasury [would] look rather silly.^81
A curious conversation, this: there is no reason to doubt that Hankey's
dislike of the Treasury was deep and intensely felt; but would Hankey go
out of his way to attack its performance at precisely the time when the tide
appeared to have turned; would Fisher meekly agree to a disparagement
of the institution which he headed, although only since 1919?^82 Yet so
reads Hankey's record, to which he appended his own suspicion that
Fisher was prepared to take the post as Cabinet Secretary, if Hankey had
to step down; Hankey associated this possibility with ' a long dated civil
service cabal' to force his departure, but there is no evidence to confirm
either notion.^83 In either event, Fisher and Hankey parted with the
understanding that the latter would consider the proffered parliamentary
'whitewash' along with the Clerkship.
The Cabinet Secretary informed his staff of these recent developments:
Tom Jones and his anxious associates thought the notice of absolution in
Parliament as much as civil servants could hope for, but they were very
much taken aback as Hankey continued enthusiastically about the
Clerkship:
```
Hankey told us that whenever he had seen Sir Almeric [Fitzroy] he had said to
himself: 'There goes me.' 'The Cabinet was a committee of the Privy Council;
what more proper than that the Secretary of the Cabinet and the Committee of
Imperial Defence should also be Clerk to the Privy Council. Besides it would
restore the relations with the King which he enjoyed in the pre-L. G. days when
after each meeting of the CID he reported in person to the King. It would enhance
the prestige of the office to be thus in touch with the Sovereign.'^84

The Secretary's enthusiasm for the symmetry of the arrangement and the
prestige attendant to it did not carry over to his associates; Tom Jones
recorded that he 'relapsed into a painful silence,' apparently fearing for
Hankey's integrity, and according to him, Rupert Howorth commented
that' Only Dumas could do justice to the events of this day!' The Deputy
Secretary's suspicions were misplaced: the Cabinet Secretary had already
taken care to protect Jones' post - although his associations with Lloyd
George had been close - and generally he looked to spare his senior staff.


```
Crisis 1922 105
```
Yet Hankey might have been more convincing had he advanced at this
time the explanation that his appointment as Clerk solved a continuing
problem, reflected in criticisms voiced by 'self-styled constitutional
authorities' that the presence of a Secretary not sworn to secrecy violated
the secrecy of Cabinet meetings: the Clerk in fact subscribed an oath very
similar to that of the Privy Counsellors.^85 A constitutional point to be sure,
but it was not one which much preoccupied the press, which continued to
question both the need for, and the performance of, the Cabinet
Secretariat.
Bonar Law's Glasgow speech was widely reported in the midst of the
electoral campaign; The Times endorsed his call for a return to ' normal
procedure in methods of government.' In its first leader, the prestigious
journal inexcusably fostered the confusion of the two Secretariats by
claiming that Hankey's body 'in practice became a Prime Ministerial
Department for the conduct of important national affairs apart from, or
even in subversion of, well-tried constitutional practices and safe-
guards.'^86 Confident that the quarry was in their sights, the Beaver-
brook and Rothermere newspapers went to even greater lengths: the
Daily Mail asserted that' Sir Maurice Hankey's share in the direction of
the country has been distinctly unconstitutional'; Beaverbrook's Evening
Standard engaged a man whom Hankey had once dismissed from his staff
to write a lengthy article describing the Secretariat as 'simply an
expansion of Sir Maurice Hankey,' which was involved in 'issue[ing]
orders to all the Ministers, who become mere subordinates.'^87
At his next meeting with Bonar Law, on the 29th, Hankey responded in
a direct way to the Prime Minister's raising matters of Cabinet business,
replying that he could not do so unless he knew that he would be able to
continue on as Cabinet Secretary. As well, he had prepared what he
described as a' resigning document for publication if necessary' which he
handed to the Prime Minister, recounting the concerns which he had
previously raised with Warren Fisher:
He [Bonar Law] read it, said I was too sensitive, and then promised to meet me
everywhere - a statement in Parliament refuting the foul accusation against the
Cabinet Office, i.e. encroachment on Foreign policy; the statement of Sept. 16th;
overstaffing and extravagance; and interference with the press. Bonar also
promised that we should revert to the position of a subordinate dept. of Treasury
and should not be swallowed by the Treasury, and that I should have my own
staff, which I volunteered to reduce to a minimum.^88
The Prime Minister also indicated that he had spoken to Wickham Steed
of The Times, protesting the recent criticisms of the Cabinet Office.
Although pleased with Bonar Law's position, Hankey still harbored
suspicions about the designs of Warren Fisher:' The Treasury began by
trying to swallow us from the head. The mouthful was too big. Now they


106 A man and an institution

will try to swallow us from the tail.' The Cabinet Secretary resolved not
to accept his ' vital clerical machine' being put on the Treasury vote, since
that would entail control by someone else.^89 Since that someone was likely
to be the Treasury, Hankey once again committed to paper, within his
diary, an angry indictment of that' so-called Central Department of the
Government [which] has failed as regards the past, present, and future.'^90
Further meetings between Fisher and Hankey followed, and the
Permanent Secretary to the Treasury gave way:
[he] said I should have my staff on my own vote as a subordinate Dept. of the
Treasury... He said he would put forward a Minute to the effect that in his view
the logical plan was the absorption of the Cabinet Office into the Treasury; that
owing to my personal position he would not press it and would agree to the
Cabinet Office being a subordinate Dept. of the Treasury; that there was a minor
question as to which vote the clerks and typists etc. should be on, in which we also
disagreed, but he did not think it necessary to quarrel over it and would therefore
agree to let me have my way.^91

Fisher had very little to show for his efforts, for there is good reason to
think that he was intent upon the absorption of the Secretariat: far from
the Cabinet Secretary serving as a fourth Treasury Controller, Fisher
had secured only Hankey's' consent to leave Whitehall Gardens and to go
to the other side of Whitehall, where... [he] should be under the same roof
as the Prime Minister.' The Cabinet Secretary had anticipated such a
move^92 - in fact he personally never made the trip, although he served
nearly another sixteen years in his post. Even this rumored shift won the
new regime little more than laughter at Lloyd George's hands: in a speech
replying to the serious allegations which his successor had endorsed,
Lloyd George attacked the lack of concrete proposals - he could find only
two - masking as the new government's electoral program. One such
proposal, he noted, involved no more than putting ' Sir Maurice Hankey,
the Cabinet Secretary, into a pantechnicon van and transfer [ing] him
from one side of the street to the other.'^93
Nonetheless, Sir Warren Fisher held out for a continuation of the
Secretariat's status only for the duration of Hankey's tenure of office,
which angered the Cabinet Secretary, who considered this a remarkable
gloss on Fisher's willingness to accept Hankey's case.^94 Yet Fisher had
deferred to Hankey's 'personal position,' and thus his new proposal
represented a skilled withdrawal, albeit a defeat for his design. For his
part, Hankey objected to any inference that the Secretariat would one day
be 'swallowed' whole into the Treasury; he maintained that any
declaration of principle concerning the distant future of the Secretariat
would elicit a similar declaration of interest on his part. Rather than
continue the exchange of views, Fisher settled for the abstract principle
that the Treasury was 'the natural body to provide for the secretarial


```
Crisis 1922 107
```
needs of the Cabinet,' wording which Hankey agreed to in the joint draft
at long last agreed to on 7 November.^95 With his post securely in hand,
and his office possessed of an effective autonomy, Hankey noted in his
diary on the following day: 'I hope the matter is closed.' And so it was,
except for a renewed struggle when Hankey stepped down as Secretary to
the Cabinet in 1938; although the two men disputed the succession at that
time, the independence of the Cabinet Office had been won in 1922. In
the years that followed, Hankey and Fisher worked closely together, in an
especially significant way with regard to the vital question of British
rearmament in the 1930s.
What had their fortnight of such civil but determined strife concerned?
For Hankey's part, the issue was no less than the survival of the Cabinet
Secretariat as it had developed in war and peace, beholden to no master
save the Cabinet. In this sense, Hankey sought to conserve the mechanism
which he and Lloyd George had forged to bring order and efficiency to
the increasingly complex business of government. Sir Warren Fisher
stood for reform, in the name of the central department of government,
but reform to what end? Hankey and his Secretariat stood as a formidable
obstacle to the further centralization of the bureaucracy under the
Treasury upon which Fisher was intent: whether his immediate purpose
was to transform Hankey into a Treasury official or to replace him with a
'regular' civil servant,^96 Hankey's operation remained outside the circle
of'Treasury control.' Yet there was more than administrative centraliz-
ation to Fisher's conception of the Civil Service: Horace Wilson has
pointed to his distaste for the corruption of the Lloyd George regime, his
dislike of the Garden Suburb and the inefficient administrative arrange-
ments around the person of the Prime Minister. The new premier could
tend to the political operation centered in Downing Street, but Fisher
could hardly ignore that auxiliary of power, the Cabinet Secretariat,
under the direction of a civil servant who was not accountable to the
central department of government. Such an anomaly must have troubled
Fisher, since the reorganization of 1919-20, including the designation of
the Permanent Secretary as Head of the Civil Service, had gained for the
Treasury ' a completed circle of control... at no time in the past had the
relationship of Treasury control with the machinery of government been
so logically formulated or so clearly enunciated.'^97 Very likely in Fisher's
mind, that' circle' was not quite complete, and thus the' take-over' bid of
1922 is readily understood.
Nonetheless, Fisher consistently held that the re-organization 'made
no change so far as the position of the Secretary to the Treasury in his
relationship to the [Civil] Service is concerned,' contending that a
Treasury Blue Note of 1887 had alluded to the dual functions which he
discharged. In fact, Stanley Baldwin had to admit in Parliament that


```
108 A man and an institution
```
while the association of the two functions dated to 1867, the file
containing the official Treasury Minute and certain related papers had
been missing for more than fifty years.^98 Though a source of embarrass-
ment for the Treasury, the missing file essentially made no difference, as
Fisher was able to sustain the association of the two; one of his successors
noted that the re-organization of 1919-20 ' substituted for a rather vague
informal arrangement something clear, precise, and formal.' However,
this successor, Sir Edward Bridges, acknowledged that in one matter
Fisher had outreached himself, commenting that because 'the Cabinet
Secretariat serves all Ministers, it is right that it should not be absorbed
into the Treasury.'^99 Bridges had served both as Cabinet Secretary and as
Permanent Secretary to the Treasury, and his testimony bears directly
upon the soundness of Hankey's insistence upon institutional autonomy.
Yet in all fairness to Fisher, his desire to absorb the Cabinet Secretariat
was but a part of a greater campaign to insulate the Civil Service from
partisan politics, so that with the Army, Navy, and Air Force the Civil
Service would constitute 'one Service of the Crown with four Divi-
sions.'^100 Concurrently, he sought to abolish the distinction between the
Foreign and the Home Civil Service; here too his over-riding concern
was the efficiency of the public service, reflecting an intention ' so to
reform the Civil Service as to make of it a single efficient entity, a unified
machine in which advancement came by merit, whose standards of
conduct were of the highest and whose administrative capabilities would
not be impeded by jealousies or red tape.'^101 In considerable measure
Hankey sympathized with Fisher's design, since he had been sufficiently
discomfited by the activities of the Downing Street 'irregulars' to
welcome the maintenance of professional standards. At the same time,
Hankey would surely have agreed with Thomas Balogh's judgment,
based upon the experiences of two world wars, that such professionalism
encourages the development of a mandarin caste, superb in the execution
of policy but woefully deficient in the ability to formulate new policies. In
the context of war, Balogh argues, 'whenever any effort had to be
organized, indeed palpably threatening disaster averted, outsiders had to
be recruited to take charge.'^102 In such a context, Balogh viewed Fisher's
formal appointment as Head of the Civil Service as 'total victory' for the
bureaucrats in the struggle with the ' outsiders' whom Lloyd George had
used to bypass administrative obstacles to a successful war effort. Yet
Warren Fisher was no orthodox 'mandarin,' since he was from the first a
reformer intent upon the eradication of departmentalism and the
unification of the Civil Service.^103 On the other hand, Hankey - despite
his military background and experience as CID Secretary - must be
ranged with the 'outsiders,' among the most important innovators of the
First World War. Thus his resistance to Fisher's scheme represented a


```
Crisis 1922 109
```
defence of progressive innovation in government, undertaken in order to
enable the Cabinet and the Prime Minister to cope with the increasing
complexity of twentieth-century government.^104 Like Fisher, Hankey
feared a revival of departmentalism, although the Cabinet Secretary had
in mind a massive exercise on the part of the Treasury, at the expense of
effective government. Though the two men were reformers, Hankey had
accomplished his and wished to protect it; Fisher wished to close his
'circle' in 1922. Much had been at stake as they clashed: in fact the
survival of the Cabinet Secretariat, cast along lines laid down in the Lloyd
George era, serves as proof that Hankey had waged his struggle against
Fisher's design and Law's apparent indifference in a worthy cause which
time has sustained.

An immediate task for Hankey was settling with the new Cabinet the way
in which its members wished him to handle its business. Already by the
30th of October, the Cabinet Secretary summed up for Bonar Law the
procedures followed by the coalition, as amended since the time he had
left that body; he took care to spell out an exception to a general rule
concerning the contents of the minutes:

The record under each heading is as short as possible, unless the Cabinet itself
desires a full record. Sometimes a Minister who has to make a speech has asked for
a full record. If new facts are introduced during the meeting, such as a telegram
which has not been circulated, a short precis of the reasons for a decision is given,
but this precis is anonymous and the views expressed by individual Ministers are
only occasionally recorded at their request.^105

On the following day, Hankey drew up 'Draft Instructions to the
Secretary of the Cabinet,' which, slightly revised and provisionally
approved, became the guidelines for the new administration.^106 At the
first meeting of the new Cabinet on 1 November, the Secretary was
charged with preparing the Agenda Paper in accordance with the
premier's wishes and with attending Cabinet meetings to record conclu-
sions; Hankey personally was buoyed by the 'many flattering tributes'
paid him by members of the new Cabinet.^107 Further, the Cabinet
reaffirmed recent practices of the Secretariat with regard to succinct
minutes -' in the absence of instructions to the contrary the record is to be
as short as possible, and, apart from the conclusion itself, should
normally be limited to such explanation as is indispensable to render the
conclusion itself intelligible.'^108 Provision was made for the expression of
individual dissent, again confirming recent practices. A departure was
effected in the Cabinet's willingness to widen the circulation of Cabinet
Minutes, in their entirety: ministers retained the responsibility for
communicating relevant decisions to their own departments.^109 No doubt
Hankey welcomed a procedure which freed him from an onerous process


###### I io A man and an institution

###### of selection; an additional benefit was the underscoring of the

###### Secretariat's liaison function, because no ministers could be bypassed, so

far as Cabinet records were concerned. These procedural decisions reveal

###### that campaign oratory aside, Bonar Law, who was familiar with the

###### Secretariat's work, recognized the utility of the institution. While

Hankey had readily yielded work which gave the appearance of encroach-

###### ing upon departmental responsibilities, the core of his operation was

intact.

###### Bonar Law tempered his campaign criticism in short order: where

previously he had not countered the charge that the Secretariat was over-

###### staffed and too expensive, on the 2nd of November he reminded his

###### audience of the conclusion of the Geddes Committee, namely that the

###### size of the body was proportionate to the work of the office. He insisted

###### that the changes within the Secretariat were of a piece with the change in

regimes:

###### It is not... that it has been an extravagant and wasteful department. I have made

###### that change with the approval of my colleagues, because I think that now the

whole system ought to be altered if we are to get back to the old customs regarding

###### the essential machinery of government... The Romans, politically, were a very

###### wise people. They had a different system in peace and war... During the war we

set up a War Cabinet. You had to have things centralised. That was right in war,
but now we have come back to normal times. Let us do as the Romans did; let us

###### get back to normal machinery.^110

Law himself sought a different role from that of his predecessor, who had
settled major matters by himself:' That is not my idea. My idea is that of a
man at the head of a big business who allows the work to be done by others

###### and gives it general supervision. That is my idea of the work of the Prime

###### Minister.' In Bonar Law's mind, Lloyd George had too often beaten the

###### drums of war; his aim was to tidy up the latter-day Roman Empire. As

###### 'businessmen' had taken up the tasks of government, the collective

###### responsibility of the Cabinet prevailed over the dominance of a single

###### individual. Yet the Tory government recognized that the patterns of

###### secretarial work could be altered to accommodate the different needs of

the post-war period.

###### One further eruption occurred within those ranks: in this unnecessary

###### instance, the censure of ' the too powerful and too numerous Cabinet

###### Secretariat'^111 came from an individual, Lord Curzon, who had as

###### recently as 23 October promised to defend the Secretariat publicly.

###### Curzon's censure was doubly gratuitous, as Hankey recorded with

###### distaste verging on contempt:

He had actually asked me to lend a stenographer to report the [electoral] meeting
and I sent Owen my best man. After the meeting Owen came to me very depressed

###### and read the passage. Then I got a message that Curzon particularly wanted the


```
Crisis 1922 in
```
speech today. Previously he had said tomorrow would do. I tried to borrow some
' dictatees' from the F.O. but their people had all gone, so poor Owen had to work
to 9:30 p.m. to reproduce it. How nice? You abuse us like that and then sponge on
our efficiency because the rotten Foreign Office cannot provide an efficient
stenographer.^112
The Cabinet Secretary immediately remonstrated with the Foreign
Secretary both about his remarks - Curzon could hardly claim to having
been misquoted - and the abuse of his staff:

I pointed to the difficulty of maintaining the morale of the office when they were
asked to work late to record the false charges made by a Minister whom we had
regarded as a friend. Lord Curzon was frightfully upset. Said his words had been
hasty and unpremeditated and delivered on the spur of the moment. I made him
feel, he said, that he would never deliver another speech again.^113

Proffered a public apology, Hankey declined rather than call attention to
what The Times had not after all printed, but instead he called together his
staff, pledged them to secrecy and read them Curzon's recantation of
'words which were certainly never intended to convey any hostile
criticism.'^114
Yet the bitterness felt within the Secretariat did not dissipate
forthwith, as Lawrence Burgis many years later recollected the Foreign
Secretary's ' double-faced action ... he was the champion fence-sitter of
all time.'^115 Hankey's own feelings were as acute, as Tom Jones recorded
barely a week after the episode:

```
He mentioned the Curzon incident and had by this time realized how con-
temptible Curzon's action had been. I said L.G. would never have done that and
that in fact in any crisis of this kind he was much the greater gentleman than the
noble Marquis. He agreed and said the same was true of Balfour. As to Bonar
Law's public utterances on the subject he felt he had been very tepid in his
treatment of us and had not erred on the side of generosity.^116
There is ample justification for Hankey's feelings towards the premier
and his Foreign Secretary in the events outlined above, but Hankey's
disposition could not have been improved by the repeated failure of the
Cabinet Secretariat to disappear as a campaign issue when the general
election drew to a close. Bonar Law's words with Wickham Steed did not
prevent The Times from listing 'Abolition of the Cabinet Secretariat'
among the planks of the Unionist platform.^117 The Tories were con-
firmed in office by the electorate, and the reversion to a more evident
pattern of collective responsibility persisted, although Hankey's oper-
ation represented a survival of war-time 'reform.'^118 Once the dust of the
campaign had settled, the Prime Minister announced, on 27 November
1922, that his government would retain the Cabinet Secretariat 'to
provide such secretarial service as the Cabinet requires to facilitate the
transaction of its business.'^119 At the same time he noted a reduction in the
```

```
112 A man and an institution
```
number of staff and a transfer - or in Hankey's terminology,' retransfer' -
of its estimate to the Treasury and Subordinate Departments vote.
Though no encomiums were addressed to Whitehall Gardens, Hankey
could take satisfaction from the subsequent clarification of his own
position: 'The Cabinet Secretary is, like any other, a permanent Civil
Servant, and I think his experience with one Government would be of
value to the next.'^120 Stanley Baldwin announced that the Secretariat
staff, which on i October had numbered 102, had been reduced to 63,
with another 23 declared redundant and put on notice.^121 A Cabinet
Secretariat reduced in size and shed of ancillary responsibilities had
assumed a permanent status.
Government spokesmen insisted that the Cabinet Secretariat now had
no scope for policy-making. Such a description recalled Hankey's own
involvement in international conferences: between November 1921 and
May 1922, the Cabinet Secretary had spent seven months in attending
the Washington Naval Conference and the Genoa Conference, although
Balfour's praise of Hankey's role left no doubt of his secretarial
contributions: 'What on earth should we have done if you had not
developed your admirable machinery for extracting the required needles
from the large bundles of hay which accumulate round any prolonged
conference?'^122 To be sure, no evidence that Hankey actually formulated
' policy' exists, although his influence upon the likes of Balfour and Lloyd
George cannot be gainsaid.^123 Perhaps such ambiguity accounts for
Baldwin's inept handling of a parliamentary question whether 'the
former practice of using the Secretariat for conducting foreign negoti-
ations ' had ceased; he replied' absolutely,' although he continued - when
pressed by Austen Chamberlain - that to the best of his knowledge the
Secretariat had not been used for that purpose.^124
Nonetheless, Hankey had already been informed - on 30 November,
when Bonar Law had delimited the Cabinet Secretary's role to the
keeping of Cabinet records^125 - by the premier himself that he would be
associated in the 'conduct' of foreign policy negotiations in the im-
mediate future:

```
To-day Bonar Law astonished me by saying that he wants me to undertake the
secretarial work for the big conference which is to meet in London next week on
reparations - Poincare, Mussolini, Theunis etc. I urged that the Foreign Office
should undertake it, but he said he thought I should have to, as the F.O. were
already strained in providing a secretariat at Lausanne. I was vastly tickled at this
request, after the speeches he and Curzon have made to the effect that never again
shall the Cabinet Secretariat take part in International Conferences. Even if I do
not act as Secretary it is very humourous that I should have been asked to do so.^126
At the conference, which centered on the conversations of the four
premiers, Hankey found himself, 'once more in the familiar role of
```

```
Crisis 1922 113
```
secretary to a meeting of Prime Ministers.'^127 In the meantime, Thomas
Jones, for whose continuation as Deputy Secretary Hankey had appealed
to Bonar Law, had been pressed into service writing speeches for the new
premier, as he had for Lloyd George.^128 Thus the two leading figures in
the Secretariat were asked to play personal as well as institutional roles
within the new regime, whatever the talk about the Cabinet Office serving
only the record-keeping needs of the Cabinet.
In institutional terms, Hankey was quite content with the develop-
ments since the first Cabinet meeting, although these were not without
irony, as he recorded on 26 November:

My work is proceeding on nearly the same line as in the past. I attend all meetings
of the Cabinet and keep the Minutes exactly as before.^129 My relations with Bonar
Law are very nearly the same as my relations were with Lloyd George. In spite of
all the talk of' Conferences of Ministers' and ' Cabinet Cmtees' being unconsti-
tutional, force of circumstances has compelled the new Government to adopt this
method of transacting its business. We have had two Conferences of Ministers
presided over by the Prime Minister this week, and the Cabinet has already set up
Cabinet Committees to deal with Home Affairs, Ireland, Mesopotamia, Un-
employment, and the Air question. I cannot supply secretaries for all these from
my reduced staff and I have ' farmed out' the Unemployment Committee to the
Ministry of Health[!] and 'Ireland' to Lionel Curtis of the Colonial Office, who
took the corresponding Committee under the late Government. We do the
distribution of documents but not their reproduction. It is amusing to observe
that owing to departmental jealousy there are now two Secretaries, one from the
Ministry of Health and one from the Ministry of Labour, both highly paid
officials, with a third man to take the Minutes. All this was done single-handed by
Wicks of my office, who drew £700 a year and did other work as well, when we
supplied the secretary!^130

Hankey's comment, which of course is not without its bias, suggests that
the ' economies' effected through the reduction of Secretariat staff were
illusory, since the work concentrated in the Secretariat would be done less
efficiently scattered among the departments. The reduction in staff did
not much compromise the Secretariat's vital role in co-ordinating
government policy, linking together the Cabinet's proposing and the
departments' disposing. Certainly the profile of the Cabinet Office was
lowered with the departure of Lloyd George, and it may have receded
from what has been called 'the limelight,' but it is well not to exaggerate
its withdrawal from the stage, whether serving the Cabinet or nearly two
dozen international conferences of the inter-war period.^131
Yet little remained known of the activities of the Cabinet Office, and
less about its origins, after the flurry of interest - in the main, politically
motivated - in the year of its crisis, 1922. A decade and a half later, from
within the well-informed circles of Cambridge academia, G. M. Treve-
lyan confessed ignorance in writing to Hankey:


114 ^ man and an institution

```
I want to get one point right - even the latest edition of Anson's Law of
Constitution throws no light. When did the Cabinet first have a Secretary and
regular Minutes? I gather the change happened during the war, and has obtained
ever since?... Was there a Secretary of the Cabinet as distinct from the War
Cabinet between 1916 and 1919?^132
Absent from 'the limelight' after 1922, in reality the Cabinet Secretariat
had weathered the storm and remained on course.

Hankey's presence at the first gathering of European statesmen in which
Bonar Law took part led him privately to question the widely heralded
distinction between the ways of Lloyd George and those of his successor:

Bonar Law is more tricky than I suspected ... he asked to meet the Belgians
(Theunis and Jaspar) alone, and asked them to Downing St., and for some reason
he did not want Poincare to know they were conspiring. (Vain thought!
Foreigners always tell!) I met them all coming downstairs together. Theunis and
Jaspar entered the Cabinet room by the usual entrance from the hall. Bonar came
in through another door from the private secretary's room. Seeing M. Poincare in
the Cabinet room he turned to the Belgians (whom he had just left at the bottom of
the stairs) and greeted them effusively, shaking them by the hand. And the Morning
Post and other papers this morning are contrasting the ' straightness' of Bonar
Law with the obliquity of LI. G.! The latter would not have done this, I feel sure.
It makes me suspect that Bonar was behind Warren Fisher all the time.^1

Despite his resentment with the recent treatment of the Cabinet
Secretariat and his suspicions of his new Tory masters, Hankey soon
came to their service in a fashion which demonstrated unequivocally the
value of scrupulous record-keeping. His role was ironic, as it turned upon
his defence of Curzon's past actions from an attack mounted by partisans
of Lloyd George. Yet it was in Beaverbrook's Sunday Express that there
surfaced in December 1922 a letter sent to Curzon earlier in the year by
the-then Greek premier, Gounaris, calling the British Foreign
Secretary's attention to the faltering strength of Greek arms in the
struggle with Turkey; he had warned that unless British arms and money
were forthcoming, Greece would have to withdraw from Asia Minor. Nor
was this warning an isolated instance, because the letter was part of a
lengthy correspondence which the two leaders had carried on. The
implication was clear: throughout 1922, Curzon had been apprised that
the Greek army in Turkey stood on the verge of disaster.
Adding tragic force to this revelation was the execution in Athens in
late November of Gounaris and five of his colleagues, in what amounted


##### n6 A man and an institution

##### to an updating of Voltaire's maxim, 'pour encourager les autres.' In this

##### climate, several of Curzon's coalition colleagues claimed that they had

never been shown Gounaris' warning, because the Foreign Secretary had

##### failed to circulate to the Cabinet a document of grave import.^2 Ever a

partisan and now among the Tory 'outs,' Lord Birkenhead criticized the
poor judgment and secretive ways of his former Cabinet colleague, using
as his text Curzon's reply of 6 March to Gounaris' warning, an exchange
which Beaverbrook had published:

What was said by the noble Marquess was that he had confidence that the historic
martial qualities of the Greek Army would suffice to meet the needs of the next
few weeks and of the campaign that was so soon to follow.

##### If that advice did not mean:' Stay, at least for the present,' I do not understand

the meaning of words, whether they be employed in diplomacy or for any other

##### purpose, and I most deeply deplore that we in the Cabinet were not allowed an

opportunity of examining this letter for ourselves, and giving our opinions upon

##### it, and of seeing whether there might not have been evolved from Cabinet

discussions, with the collective gravity of responsibility, an advice which might
have saved the lives of these Ministers.^3

##### In pressing the attack on Curzon and those who had criticized the

##### 'adventurist' policies of the late administration, Birkenhead acted

impetuously, even recklessly: trusting to his own memory, shared by his
political associates, he failed to consult either the Cabinet records or their
custodian, Sir Maurice Hankey. The Cabinet Secretary had no trouble in

##### locating in Cabinet files a copy of the Gounaris letter in question, which

had in fact been circulated to the Cabinet by the Foreign Office. A search

##### of the Cabinet Minutes revealed that 'the telegram had never been

##### considered by the Cabinet,' he informed Bonar Law, but the point

##### remained that the Cabinet had been given access to the information.^4

##### While Birkenhead lamely protested that he had queried nearly every

##### colleague of' first-class importance' on the matter, the evidence was such

that he apologized to Curzon for a statement made with every confidence

##### but 'which, when the facts are fully examined, is found to be without

foundation.'^5
Thus passed within a weekend what had initially appeared as a budding
political crisis, and the episode must have been instructive, particularly

##### for those in the new regime who had no direct experience of the

Secretariat's role: the utility of Cabinet records had been demonstrated,

##### and Hankey had shown himself master of the situation, in part at the

##### expense of his former chief, Lloyd George. If Hankey's impartiality had

##### once been a concern, surely it could be no longer. As well, the incident

##### served to underscore the desirability of a clear separation between the

##### Cabinet Secretariat and the Prime Minister's own staff of Private

##### Secretaries: had the former been absorbed by the partisan staff in

Downing Street, any such arbitration of disputes among former Cabinet


The Secretariat in the 1920s: policies and procedures^117
colleagues would have been highly unlikely. Could any government trust
' records' maintained by political appointees of predecessor regimes?^6
Continuity in record-keeping would certainly have been adversely
affected.
Although Bonar Law's Cabinet had settled upon a scheme for
maintaining such Cabinet records, they did not confront directly the
question of the use to which official materials could be put in personal
memoirs, a matter which Hankey feared as a likely source of leakage of
Cabinet secrets. Their coalition predecessors had decided in January
1922 that former ministers would be allowed to publish official docu-
ments in order to vindicate their actions, provided such publication did
not compromise current public interest: in the case at hand, Winston
Churchill had secured this right of direct quotation, in order to rebut
criticisms directed his way in a number of officially informed accounts,
most conspicuously in Lord Esher's The Tragedy of Lord Kitchener,
published in 1921.^7 The former First Lord proved liberal in his use of this
ministerial right in the second volume of his war memoirs, entitled World
Crisis, 1915. Hankey played no discernible role in the discussion
concerning Churchill's publication, although the materials which he
collected for the Cabinet Committee on the Use of Official Material in
Publications suggest that his own concern was to prevent similar use of
post-war Cabinet papers; towards this end, he hoped to regain custody of
ministerial files of Cabinet papers from those ministers who had been free
since 1919 to retain individual copies.^8
The Cabinet Secretary likely recognized that the stream of war-time
revelations could not be dammed, because too much concerning the
conduct of the war had already been published, particularly by military
figures critical of HMG's conduct of the war; nor were the 'frocks'
disposed to deny themselves the right of informed reply, as Churchill's
attitude confirmed:' The question... is not whether disclosures are to be
made, but whether partial disclosures are to stand; not whether all
persons concerned in these historic events are to preserve a life-long
silence, but whether only certain persons are to be indefinitely prevented
from stating their case.'^9 Although he had carried that question in the
Coalition Cabinet, Churchill now perceived a threat to his freedom in the
statements Bonar Law had made in the House of Commons; on 15
February, the premier acknowledged that the present First Lord had
granted Churchill authority to publish ' certain Admiralty orders issued
to the Fleet during the war,' adding that' it is of course an obligation upon
Ministers and officials not to disclose confidential State or official papers
or information without the previous approval of His Majesty's Govern-
ment for the time being, or in the case of Cabinet information, without the
consent of His Majesty.'^10 This statement did not satisfy Churchill's


```
n8 A man and an institution
```
critics, who pressed the matter further; Law seemingly refused to be
drawn beyond his previous statement, until asked whether such reve-
lations constituted a breach of the Privy Counsellor's Oath, to which he
tersely replied: ' I have taken the oath and personally I think I should
consider it a breach.'^11 Yet the Prime Minister refused to consider any
formal proceedings: HMG would take no measures beyond reiterating
the rules applying to such publications.
Although on holiday, Churchill disliked the implications of Bonar
Law's statement and he was concerned with the Cabinet's recent
establishment of a Committee on the Use of Official Material in
Publications; he took counsel with Lloyd George, implicitly suggesting a
common front against any attempt to restrain them from publishing their
own accounts, drawing upon the official papers which each retained.^12 In
the event, that front persisted until both men had completed their
memoirs of the First World War, in Lloyd George's case more than a
decade later. Churchill protested shortly to Bonar Law that he had ' in no
way trespassed beyond the limits which have frequently been used by
Ministers in defending, on the platform or in the country, themselves,
their departments or the Government to which they belonged.' Yet - in
contrast to others whose memoirs had drawn upon official documents -
Churchill advised Law that he had ' consulted the Prime Minister of the
day (Mr Asquith) in regard to every reference, however general, which I
made to Cabinet proceedings.' Since no formal arrangements for official
scrutiny of ministerial memoirs existed, Bonar Law's diffidence is easily
understood. Drawn into the discussion by the Prime Minister, Hankey
accepted the main lines of Churchill's argument; he characterized
Churchill's involving Asquith as 'a new factor of great interest.'^13 In
time, this 'factor' became institutionalized, and thus Winston
Churchill's procedure gave birth to the official 'vetting' of ministerial
memoirs.
In future, Churchill submitted to an official review of his memoirs:
with the completion of the third volume, he asked both Lloyd George and
Hankey to 'vet' it, using the latter's approbation in approaching the
former, Prime Minister for much of the period: ' Hankey, who is no fair
weather friend of yours, has read it all and thinks it is scrupulously fair. Of
course I bulk very largely in it all, but then it is I who am telling the tale. I
hope you will tell yours when the time comes.'^14 Some years later, the
former war leader told his tale, and he too turned to Hankey to read and
' vet' his memoirs, although the Cabinet Secretary pointed out his own
unofficial role in such proceedings:

```
I have, of course, no status to give you official permission to publish official
documents. I can, on my own authority, exempt you neither from the Privy
Counsellor's Oath nor from the Official Secrets Act.
```

```
The Secretariat in the 1920s: policies and procedures 119
```
I am no lawyer, but I think that the only way in which you can proceed in
absolute security is to ask for official permission through the proper channel, viz
the Prime Minister.
At the same time I am not suggesting that this procedure has invariably been
followed. There are precedents both ways.^15
Certainly Hankey had begun to function as an informal censor of Cabinet
memoirs by this time; such a role came naturally to the Cabinet Secretary,
in part because of his knowledge of the inside history of the Great War
but also because of his impartial status. There can be no doubt that he
discharged a rather thankless task in a conscientious fashion, showing
great compassion for those whom he suspected history might treat
unkindly; he thought it regrettable that men who had served their country
faithfully, if controversially, should reap harsh criticism. In the 1930s,
when the political wheel of fortune had revolved against Churchill, he
urged Lloyd George to temper a particular criticism which was ' fright-
fully damaging':
Although Churchill is my friend, I am not pleading for him on that ground. At the
present time he is rather down on his luck and this passage [in the third volume of
Lloyd George's memoirs] will hit dreadfully. It will always be quoted against him
if he is ever in, or aspires to get into, office again ... I ask myself whether it is
really to the public advantage that our national heroes should be hauled off their
pedestals.^16
From the Cabinet Secretary's perspective, 'vetting' ministerial accounts
of service afforded Hankey a means of maintaining a cloak of secrecy over
Cabinet deliberations for nearly the whole of the inter-war years,
although little could be done to stem the reports of war-time strife
between' frocks' and' brasshats.' Hankey had precisely this distinction in
mind in urging Churchill in 1926 to conclude his World Crisis with the
Armistice of November 1918, although he advanced other reasons in
urging Churchill to delete post-1918 chapters from the last volume of his
memoirs:

```
Chapter XXV contains a most brilliant description of the end of the war on a note
of triumph. It concludes, if I can remember right, with a thought-compelling
query as to whether these things are to happen again. On that note I would end the
volume. 'The Aftermath' is too much of an anti-climax. Instead of ending with
wedding bells or, shall we say, joy bells, it takes us into the squalid circumstances
of a poverty-stricken marriage. I think that 'The Aftermath' would come better
as the first chapter of a future book on the reconstruction - the time for which is
not yet ripe.^17
Here, at any rate, is the genesis of the separate volume which Churchill
published only three years later, with an expression of thanks to Hankey
for his assistance in its preparation;^18 Churchill regarded the volume as a
continuation of his 'contemporary contribution to the history of the
Great War,'^19 concluding with a treatment of the Chanak crisis of 1922.
```

120 A man and an institution

He utilized some post-war Cabinet documents, for the most part those
which he had written, but the license afforded those ministers who had
written about the war was extended to Churchill's foray into the early
post-war years.
Hankey's unofficial role was reinforced by his functional responsibi-
lities in connection with the Official Histories, which were researched and
written by a branch within the Cabinet Office.^20 The Secretariat had
absorbed the Historical Section of the Committee of Imperial Defence,
which had undertaken such historical inquiries because Lord Esher had
contended in 1906 that War Office and Admiralty accounts failed to
perceive military operations, together with political considerations, as a
whole: the 'Official History of the War in South Africa' had been
completed in four volumes by 1910, and a history of the Russo-Japanese
war, in which Britain had not been a belligerent, occupied the whole of its
attentions until the onset of war in 1914. Even in Esher's eyes, the
operation had become suspect, and in 1913 a sub-committee of the CID
recommended that the Section revert to 'research work,' maintaining a
permanent staff of but one officer and one clerk.^21 Thus the First World
War brought new life to its operations, as the Historical Section was
charged with the ' tabulation of information of historical importance in
regard to the war,' and in short order pressures mounted for an official
history of a more popular and general character than had been the case in
the past. Although the CID's Historical Committee, which oversaw the
operations of the Section, quickly selected two authorities, John For-
tescue and Julian Corbett, respectively to write accounts of a ' Military
History' and a' Naval History,' the Treasury posed a financial obstacle to
the venture, insisting that previous publications had been ' appallingly
costly and practically unsaleable.' Hankey deftly countered that 'the
fallacy of the Treasury objection lay in the attempt to measure their value
by the test of receipts, and that if such a test were applied to other
scientific works it was probable that scientific research would come to an
end. A history was essentially a work of reference and education.'^22
Through the advocacy of the CID Secretary,^23 Treasury resistance was
overcome, and Asquith announced in June 1916 that official histories
would be undertaken; before the war had ended, the widening scope of
the project necessitated the hiring of additional historians.^24
In the minds of its practitioners, official history possessed an edu-
cational value and an objective status denied to other historical accounts.
E. Y. Daniel, Secretary of the Historical Section, warned of the risks of
leaving the study of war to private hands:

```
if widely read it owes its popularity to the amount of secret information which the
author has divulged, or to the extent to which he has entered into personal
controversies. It would be morally wrong to leave either the public or the services
to such guidance; as it is a matter of honour and common sense that the country's

```

```
unprecedented effort between 1914 and 1918 should be analysed, and its efforts
made clear ... it is the object of the government to place before the public an
absolutely reliable and impartial account of what occurred.^25

Yet the belief, which Hankey shared,^26 that the official historians were a
breed apart in their impartiality no less than in their sources was belied by
experience directly within the Historical Section. Fortescue had not
worked well within the harness of the Historical Section: his publication
of a review of Lord French's 1914 in October 1919 led to a severing of his
relationship with the 'Military History,' as Hankey explained to him:
' The Government consider it highly important that the Official History,
when published, should be recognized as thoroughly impartial. While
expressing no opinion upon the merits of the controversy, they feel that
the character of your article makes it impossible for you to continue your
association with the History without compromising its impartiality.'^27
'Impartiality' was in turn conferred upon Brigadier-General J.E.
Edmonds, who found it necessary to rewrite practically the entire
Fortescue narrative for the first volume.^28
'Naval Operations' had proved as difficult to launch; although the
Admiralty had insisted upon a prefatory note placing the responsibility
for content solely upon the author, the former First Lord, Churchill,
quickly took exception both to Corbett's selection of official documents
and to his treatment of particular episodes. Several months and much
effort was required in meeting Churchill's objections - although it is
unlikely that he was ever satisfied with Corbett's version^29 - and Hankey
was given ample cause to reflect whether official histories of recent and
controversial events could be successfully accomplished. No one, he
thought, could have been more' discreet' than Corbett, yet his judgments
were bound ' to reflect on one leader or another, on this department or on
that.' Pessimistically if not inaccurately, Hankey admitted: 'There is not
the smallest reason to suppose that the other distinguished historians
engaged on the Official Histories will be more successful.'^30 He warned
the Cabinet that the Official Histories in aggregate might prove trouble-
some, but he pointed out in their behalf that 'the education of the
professional officer' and 'the enlightenment of the public' would be
served by the prompt historical utilization of official materials which
could not be placed at the disposal of the general historian, over whom the
government could exercise no control. In fact, Hankey continued,
government had a significant stake in such a venture: 'There is the
consideration that an antidote is required to the unofficial histories, which
habitually attribute all naval and military failures to the ineptitude of the
Government, to say nothing of the accounts of individual officers,
frequently ill-informed and partisan in character, which are apt to
mislead public as well as service opinion.'
Despite Hankey's endorsement of the project, the Cabinet gave only a


###### 122 A man and an institution

###### hesitant approval to the publication of Corbett's first volume, along with

###### the initial installments of two other series; the Historical Section was

###### informed that' the preparatory work of collecting and collating material

###### ... should continue but the actual writing of these [subsequent] volumes

###### in their final shape should not be taken up, and nothing should be set in

###### so advising, the Cabinet were endorsing the recommendations of a

###### the several designated authors protested the Cabinet's warning that the

###### deliberately:' We shall evidently have a devil of a row if we don't continue

###### publication, but I think the Cabinet realised that they would have to

###### thus manifested more than cursory interest in critical reaction to

###### Corbett's venture, and a very favorable collection of reviews and clippings

###### enabled him and Hankey to secure Cabinet authorization first for the

###### extension of the ' Naval History' and in due course for other series of the

###### Official History.^34 In May 1921, the Cabinet approved publication of the

###### initial volumes in the important series dealing with the military and air

###### histories of the war;^35 at this point the Official Histories can be regarded as

###### well established, although no one would have suspected that before the

###### various volumes dealing with the Great War were completed, another

###### and arguably greater war would have supervened. Although the Official

###### authors for the series: in the case of the 'Air History,' he rejected several

###### candidates with a journalistic background, expressing a preference for

###### 'technical' rather than 'literary' Official Histories.^36

###### Throughout this undertaking, the Cabinet Secretary insisted upon the

###### protection of his major charge, Cabinet secrecy: proceedings of the

###### Cabinet and its committees were to be masked, as were individual

###### contributions to Cabinet discussions, 'subject of course to reference to

###### the Prime Minister or other Ministers in cases of doubt or difficulty.'^37

###### Other procedural guidelines were involved, with departmental scrutiny

###### provided for; thus the Official Historians were cautioned that 'in any

###### matters affecting our diplomatic relations [i.e., involving past foreign

###### policy] the proofs should be sent to the Foreign Office.'^38 Departmental

###### scrutiny could become a daunting experience: one volume was sent to no

###### less than 799 recipients for critical commentary!^39 The Prime Minister

###### gave final sanction, although it appears that nothing more than notifi-

###### cation of publication was in fact involved.^40 Thus a near-moribund

###### operation had developed into a formidable tool for the education of the

###### nation; in the process, the Historical Section of the Cabinet Office won


```

itself a place as an adjunct of Cabinet government. When in 1922 Warren
Fisher suggested that the Section be transferred from the Cabinet Office
to a less conspicuous location, such as the British Museum, Hankey
promised only to canvass the notion, which came to nothing.^41 Official
Histories were in time published concerning the Second World War,
although the claim to an inherently superior account was abandoned:
'The term ["Official History"] did not imply that the work gave an
official view, or that it gave a full and complete story, or that it could be
expected that all its conclusions would stand in any long-term perspect-
ive.'^42 Distinguished though a number of them were, the official
historians were after all not a breed apart, save in their earlier access to the
sources.
Where the Historical Section pioneered, the Foreign Office followed:
after the fall of the Labour government, the new Foreign Secretary,
Austen Chamberlain, confirmed the decision taken by his predecessor,
Ramsay MacDonald, to publish a collection of 'the official documents
bearing on the general European situation out of which the war arose.'^43
Editorial responsibility was entrusted to G. P. Gooch and H. W. V.
Temperley, and Chamberlain commented that 'the reputation of the
editors offers the best guarantee of the historical accuracy and im-
partiality of their work.' Published over a thirteen year period, the eleven
volumes of British Documents on the Origins of the War testify to the
wisdom of the choice of respected historians from outside the Foreign
Office. Nonetheless, the British government had been among the last
European powers to commission such an undertaking, yielding reluc-
tantly to the valid fear voiced by R. W. Seton-Watson that 'slowly but
surely very serious injury is being done by the continued silence of the
British Government.' A campaign in the correspondence columns of The
Times had brought official acknowledgment that historians were ' gravely
handicapped when they come to deal with the charges and insinuations
directed against British policy in the period preceding the war.'^44 A war
later, Britain proved quicker off the mark in determining upon the
publication of Documents on British Foreign Policy in order ' to forestall a
German version of events, which might otherwise get in first (as after
1919) and " sell" the German case to all the innocent pedagogues and
publicists here and in America.'^45 Thus the practical importance of
prompt publication of documents ' as a result of which the war is being
fought' had this time been recognized in official circles; Oliver Harvey
even argued in terms of the public's 'moral' entitlement to examine the
record.^46

```
In his continuing defence of Cabinet secrecy, Hankey did not have
recourse in the immediate post-war years to the Official Secrets Act,
which in 1920 had been revised to strengthen earlier legislation designed
```

124 A man and an institution

```
originally to combat espionage but already in 1911 widened in scope.
Government attempts to forestall unauthorized use of official documents
```
- usually to secure some financial gain - stretched as far back into the
Victorian period as 1858, but only in 1889 had Parliament passed
    legislation designed to protect military and naval secrets; with a single
    exception, this legislation had been directed against British citizens
    disclosing secrets rather than foreign nationals 'spying' in England.^47
With the German threat as backdrop, in 1911 Parliament enacted an
    Official Secrets Act which, for all the government's stress upon its
    amending the 1889 legislation, broke new ground. Though the first
    section of the 1911 Act was directed wholly against espionage activities,
    section 2 construed as an offence the action of any person who,' having in
    his possession any information... which he has obtained or to which he
    has had access owing to his position as a person who holds office or
    has held office under His Majesty... communicates the information to
    any person other than a person to whom he is authorised to communicate
    it.' Further, although the legislation is less than clear on the point, the
    ' commonly accepted interpretation ... is that when official information
    has been communicated in contravention of section 2, the recipient
    commits an offence if he in turn communicates that information without
    authority.'^48 While prosecutions were brought during the war under the
terms of section 2, only in 1919 did the courts rule that it applied to any
    information - rather than only to secret data - obtained by a person
through his official position.^49 In such a fashion section 2 came into its
    own, and to this day it has lost neither its prominence nor its notoriety:' a
law whose original purpose was the limited and acceptable one of fighting
espionage has been widened in scope so as both to diminish the effective
working of Government and to harm society in general.'^50
    For all the fact that section 2 was not once mentioned in the cursory
Parliamentary debates of 1911, the Franks Committee maintained in its
    1972 review of the legislation that the broad provisions of section 2 had a
    deliberate design:

Although surviving official papers are incomplete... those who drafted the 1911
Bill... clearly intended it to operate as a general check against civil service leaks
of all kinds. Official papers show that from 1889 to the present day the Civil
Service has always seen this as one of the objects of the Official Secrets Act, and
has never regarded the Acts as being confined to matters connected with the safety
of the State.^51

Whether ministers of the era thought the Official Secrets Act binding
upon them is much more doubtful: although Asquith's remarks in the
House of Commons in 1915 appear to point in that direction,^52 his own
private revelations of Cabinet business and those of a number of his
colleagues point in quite the opposite direction.^53 Neither Asquith's war-


```

```
time regime nor that of Lloyd George earned particularly high marks for
the observance of secrecy in matters touching their work, although
improvements came with the systemization of War Cabinet business
through the Secretariat. Yet the Official Secrets Act did not enter the
picture, nor was it invoked to stem the flood of post-war memoirs based
upon official information. Indeed, Bonar Law's reference to Churchill's
possible breach of the Privy Counsellor's Oath suggests that the Official
Secrets Act did not operate in ministerial quarters.
Whatever the past concerns with civil service leaks, the 1920 amend-
ment incorporated further provisions against espionage: the Franks
Committee claimed that espionage was 'almost entirely' its concern,
citing the Attorney-General's remarks to the effect that the whole of the
1911 Act, including section 2, had been directed at spying.^54 Alas, the
Attorney-General, Sir Gordon Hewart, had spoken in an ambiguous,
even confusing, fashion. On the one hand, he specifically disclaimed the
contention that the revision of 1920, like the legislation of 1911, dealt only
with spying: 'it deals also with certain other things... the improper
communication of official documents, a provision due to the fact that
information of a secret nature is too often obtained from or through
indiscreet persons.' Hewart stressed two linked facets of an offence
against official secrecy: first, ' retention [of official documents] for some
purpose prejudicial to the safety or interests of the state,' a forceful clause
because a servant of the Crown may submit such a contention without
challenge in an English court;^55 and second, the unauthorized use of such
an official document. On the other hand, the Attorney-General continued
that the use of such an 'official document' had nothing to do with
materials frequently mentioned earlier in the debate, namely' a circular, a
Cabinet paper, a memorandum, or something stamped with a statement
that it is the property of His Majesty's Government.' Having excluded
the entire range of Cabinet papers, Hewart offered a description of official
documents: 'We are dealing, and dealing only, with passports, passes,
permits, certificates and the like.'^56 Such documents were the very stuff of
espionage, but for some reason Hewart refused to label them as such, and
thus clearly to limit to espionage the application of the Official Secrets
Act. The product was the confusion which the Franks Committee
remarked upon a half-century later:

We found section 2 a mess. Its scope is enormously wide... The drafting and the
interpretation of the section are obscure. People are not sure what it means, or
what kinds of action involve real risks of prosecution under it ... There is a
widely held view that the Official Secrets Act should be concerned only with spies
and traitors.^57
The emergence of such a 'widely held view' is in major part a product
of the promiscuous use of the Official Secrets Act, 1911 and 1920, by


```
126 A man and an institution
```
HMG during the inter-war years, in a fashion inconsistent with
legislative intent; the Cabinet Secretariat came in time to use the ' catch-
all ' provisions of section 2 to protect the secrecy of Cabinet proceedings.
Yet the legislation had not been initially directed against the likes of
Churchill, as we have seen, nor was it mentioned in 1923, when Bonar
Law failed to respond to a proposal that the Prime Minister make it a
condition of acceptance of ministerial office that 'no ex-Minister, until he
has been out of office for 15 years, shall be permitted, when writing
articles or books for monetary consideration, to make use of information
of a confidential character acquired during his period of office.'^58 Lloyd
George's coalition had accepted no such self-denying ordinance when the
Cabinet had resolved upon ministerial retention of official papers upon
leaving office, nor did successor governments alter the situation for
another decade. Although since 1934 ministers supposedly have not
retained comprehensive collections of Cabinet papers, their memoirs
have remained outside the scope of the Official Secrets Act; only one
exception, discussed below, mars that generalization and in that case the
former Cabinet minister himself was not prosecuted. As countless
volumes of ministerial memoirs testify, section 2 ultimately could not be
sustained against ministerial recollections, despite the attempt of
Hankey's Cabinet Secretariat to utilize the 1920 legislation in the custody
of Cabinet secrecy.

```
The history of the short-lived Bonar Law government had little further
significance for the Cabinet Secretariat: its initial reforms had reduced
the staff and the scope of the latter's activities. The new premier,
consistent with his own intentions, functioned in a different fashion from
Lloyd George, for example conducting the affairs of his own office
through Private Secretaries, dispensing with the structural remains of
Lloyd George's Secretariat.^59 Bonar Law, stricken with throat cancer,
resigned his office, and the Tory succession passed unexpectedly into the
hands of Stanley Baldwin in May 1923.
Hankey was not privy to the tangled events culminating in the
'emergence' of the new Tory leader, although it is unlikely that the
Cabinet Secretary relished the prospect either of his succession or the
widely expected appointment of Lord Curzon. His diary is silent on these
events; not until n November 1923 did Hankey speculate on recent
events, and even then at no great length: 'I have passed without note
Bonar Law's retirement, Baldwin's succession and Bonar Law's death.
Poor Bonar never had the nerve for the job of Prime Minister. The
responsibility preyed on his mind and, I feel sure, hastened on his cancer.
Baldwin has nerve but scant capacity and I fear will not last long.'^60
Setting aside Hankey's psychosomatic view of Bonar Law's terminal

illness, his prediction was not inaccurate in the short term, but in the long
run Baldwin was a better survivor than anyone foresaw. Nor did he have
any reason to hope for a long tenure on Baldwin's part, because the two
men had no strong feelings for each other; Roskill's description is
retrospective but instructive: 'From Hankey's personal point of view the
accession to power of Baldwin was a disaster. All observers of the
contemporary scene agree that, of all the Prime Ministers whom he
served, Baldwin was the one with whom he was least in sympathy. Nor is
there any doubt that the lack of sympathy was reciprocated.'^61 Whether
the situation was so stark in 1923 is problematic, because in the years that
followed the two men worked together effectively and, at times, cordially.
In 1923 it may suffice to remark that the Cabinet Secretary may well have
preferred Curzon - for all his faults - because he might have wielded
greater influence, although it should not be suggested that he was devoid
of influence over Stanley Baldwin.
Nonetheless, Hankey's diminished personal impact upon the premier
did not sever the Prime Minister's informal links to the Cabinet
Secretariat; instead, Hankey's deputy Tom Jones emerged as a leading
confidant of Baldwin, and their relationship persisted long after Jones left
the Cabinet Office in 1931. Although one could reasonably surmise that
his loss of informal standing at No. 10 would trouble the Cabinet
Secretary, there is no sign of any animosity on Hankey's part towards
Jones, in the main because in the minds of those who knew him well,
Jones was not self-serving. From within the Secretariat, Lawrence
Burgis had direct experience of Jones' behavior, which rebutted any
notion that he was an intriguer, seeking ' to advance some kind of action
that will accrue eventually to his own advantage.'^62 Within the Cabinet
Office, Hankey's authority remained unquestioned, and his loyalty to his
new chief was beyond doubt.^63 Thus the lack of intimacy between the
Prime Minister and the Cabinet Secretary, a function of their per-
sonalities, seemingly troubled no one, because it left their professional
relationship untainted.
Hankey was troubled by Baldwin's decision to call a snap general
election on the issue of Protection, although he witnessed it from afar;
when Baldwin made clear to his Cabinet his decision to go to the polls on
23 October, several ministers remained after the conclusion of the
meeting' to continue the discussion,' and at that time, as Jones noted,' the
P.M. gave Hankey a clear indication that he was not wanted.'^64 A strange
experience for Hankey, but the business of the Cabinet had been
concluded: thus the incident ought not to be exaggerated, as Patrick
Gordon Walker did by intimating that Hankey had been asked to remove
himself from a Cabinet meeting.^65 Nor was the experience novel, because
early in his tenure the Cabinet Secretary had twice been asked to


128 A man and an institution

withdraw, once for a discussion of the Secretariat and once when he was
in temporary disfavor with Lloyd George.^66 Apparently not again until
Attlee's premiership, and then only on several occasions when party
matters were discussed, has the Cabinet Secretary been asked to leave.^67
Harold Wilson recalled 'two or three occasions' between 1964 and 1970
when the Cabinet met without Secretariat officials, in the main to
consider the timing of elections; on those occasions, the Prime Minister
himself provided ' a short, usually uninformative, note for the Cabinet
records.'^68
The 1923 incident illustrates Hankey's exclusion from an advisory
capacity, even in the limited fashion of preparing the government for a
controversial electoral issue, which Tom Jones puzzled over in his own
diary:

How the P.M. came to put forward his proposals in the sudden way he did, at the
time he did, is still wrapped up in mystery... Hankey and I were given no
opportunity of putting out red lights. We could have told the P.M. with what
careful preparation L.G. paved the way for the Safeguarding of Industry Bill.^69

One suspects that Baldwin would not respond to advice couched in these
terms, and indeed he rejected the advice even of such confirmed
protectionists as Leo Amery in deciding upon an early general election.^70
In the ensuing campaign, by a strange twist of fate Tom Jones was given
leave to place caution lights in the flow of Baldwin's speech-making:

Throughout the campaign I was in the closest touch with the P.M., saw him
almost daily - every day when he was in town ... I would... tell him the main
features in the speeches of the previous day and any gossip I had heard. I would
indicate the sort of line to take, the points to combat or avoid. He never attempted
to explain to me how protection would cure unemployment. I told him several
times that all my instincts and training were dead against his policy and that I
thought that he would corrupt our politics still more. I had undertaken at the start
to do my utmost to help him, as he had asked me to help, and this I did.^71

Perhaps Jones was drawn to Baldwin in a personal fashion^72 but as a civil
servant he could rationalize his conduct; it is unlikely that he forgot that
his own survival in the 1922 reforms of the Cabinet Office had been 'a
damned close run thing,' and his position vis-a-vis Baldwin marked a
continuation of speech writing which Bonar Law had asked of him.^73
Nor, in the matter of protection, did Jones find writing speeches contrary
to his own views an impossible assignment.
Hankey limited his own consternation with the way in which Baldwin
had conducted the affairs of state to the privacy of his diary, having
discovered that 'the Tariff Reform decision has been taken without
consulting a single official,' despite a wealth of information readily
available in a number of departments. An even more troubling aspect of
the Baldwin 'Follies' of 1923 concerned his own office:


```
The Secretariat in the 1920s: policies and procedures 129
```
The most extraordinary feature of the election was that almost the whole of all the
Prime Minister's speeches was written by Tom Jones, my no. 2, who is a
passionate Free-Trader, an intimate and trusted friend of Lloyd George, voted
Liberal, and at the 1906 Election was engaged as Professor of Economics at
Glasgow University in supplying pablum for the Free-Trade campaign. Nowa-
days Tom Jones is a Civil Servant, and is supposed to have no politics.
Moreover he is the most loyal creature under the sun, and sweated blood for
Baldwin. Still no one could believe that he would be chosen to write the P.M.'s
election speeches in a Tariff Reform campaign. It shocks me inexpressibly that
the P.M. should have his speeches written for him.^74
Though Hankey registered ' shock' at this turn of events, there is an
element of disingenuousness in his comment, since he had on a number of
occasions prepared speeches for the likes of Curzon and Lloyd George,
although the Cabinet Secretary had not been involved in electioneering.^75
His anger would be more plausible had he contrasted the way in which
the Deputy Secretary to the Cabinet was being pressed into service with
the expressed intention of the Tories to limit the Secretariat to record-
keeping functions; the danger of politicizing the institution was now as
real as at any time during the coalition's existence. In the light of
Hankey's strong feelings, it is all the more surprising that his own
relations with his deputy did not suffer - as did Baldwin's majority in the
calculated if maladroit General Election of 1923 -but the two appreciated
the need to adapt their responsibilities to the desires of their new masters.
Not even in the privacy of his diary did either complain of the other's
actions, although Jones expressed some reservations with Hankey's
tight-fistedness in Cabinet Office salaries.^76
Under Unionist administrations, Hankey continued to function much
as he had in the past, for example in his efforts to ensure secrecy for the
gatherings of European statesmen, sometimes in the face of difficulties
posed by the cupidity of his counterparts. Meetings with the French were
particularly prone to leakage, and a revealing incident centered on Bonar
Law's dissent from French policies, expressed at a meeting which
according to Baldwin's close friend and political colleague, J. C. C.
Davidson, was held under conditions of 'absolute secrecy':
the whole of the discussion, with all the best things Bonar said omitted, appeared
at lunchtime in an evening paper. An inquiry was held by Hankey, and I was kept
informed on Bonar's behalf. It turned out that the Permanent Under-Secretary of
the French FO admitted that he had to give a scoop occasionally to the press, as he
was paid a ridiculously low salary and was expected to live like a gentleman, dress
well and entertain.^77

Davidson's own role raises a question concerning the heralded abolition
of the Prime Minister's Secretariat in 1922, because its work went on:
Baldwin's biographers remark on the functions discharged by


130 A man and an institution

Davidson's serving as the Chancellor of the Duchy: ' his office at the
Duchy of Lancaster was very much Baldwin's own Garden Suburb.'^78
The implication is clear: any premier needed a mechanism to discharge a
variety of political tasks which were outside the purview of the Cabinet
Secretariat, whatever it was called and wherever it was lodged; it appears
that Baldwin would have served the Cabinet Office well by seeking his
speech writer for the election of 1923 in that other office.

```
In the domestic sphere, Hankey eagerly hoped for a revival of the
Committee of Imperial Defence: since shortly after the Paris Peace
Conference, he had worked for its reactivation.^79 Lloyd George had other
matters to occupy his time, although in June 1920 the CID met for the
first time in more than five years. At that time a Standing Defence Sub-
Committee was charged with surveying the nation's defence commit-
ments, and in effect this group carried on the CID's business until the fall
of the coalition. On his own, Hankey had already undertaken the revision
and up-dating of his most favored project, the War Book, but under the
increasingly infirm Balfour, the sub-committee made no progress in what
its Secretary described as ' the serious and complete stagnation as regards
the business of the CID.' While Hankey did succeed in convoking a full
CID meeting in July 1922, the Greek misadventure - in part a result of
inadequate military intelligence - strengthened in his mind the case for a
revivified CID, a matter which he quickly raised with Lord Salisbury
when the latter assumed responsibility for the Standing Defence Sub-
Committee in the Bonar Law government.
On 17 November 1922 Hankey proposed a full agenda for a meeting of
that group, although in fact it did not begin to function until March 1923,
when it undertook a review of the co-operation and co-ordination of the
three Fighting Services. We need not follow in detail the work of that
Salisbury Sub-Committee,^80 but no study of the Cabinet Secretariat can
forego entirely Hankey's deep involvement in military affairs for the
whole of his time in Whitehall Gardens; his role was unique, and as well it
affords an understanding of the ways in which Hankey worked and of the
causes which he served. Two results of the labors of the Salisbury Sub-
Committee are relevant to this limited purpose: first, that body spun off
yet another sub-committee, chaired by Balfour, to adjudicate the volatile
question whether the Navy would gain complete control of the Fleet Air
Arm or, instead, whether that force would remain a part of the RAF, as
had been the case since 1918. In an attempt to resolve this dispute,
Hankey - whose personal sympathies were '"mildly pro-Navy"'^81 -
strove through his impartial conduct as Secretary to the parent Salisbury
Committee to win the confidence of the RAF chiefs, especially Air
Marshal Hugh Trenchard. In July 1923 the Balfour Sub-Committee
```

```
The Secretariat in the 1920s: policies and procedures 131
```
returned a verdict favoring the newest of the services, and the Salisbury
Sub-Committee in its turn endorsed that decision, although not without
some ministerial dissent. Predictably, the Admiralty proved unrecon-
ciled to the separation of the Air Arm from the Fleet;^82 Hankey continued
his efforts to secure a more lasting compromise, but the proposal of the
Balfour Sub-Committee did not long survive. Although bad feelings
between the Admiralty and the RAF persisted, Hankey's mediative
efiforts were nowhere resented, and his impartial conduct was everywhere
recognized.
The second important result of the Salisbury Sub-Committee's work
was its recommendation that, to secure improved co-ordination, the
Chiefs of Staff of the three services constitute a committee of the CID:
each of the three Chiefs of Staff will have an individual and collective
responsibility for advising in defence policy as a whole, the three constituting, as
it were, a Super-Chief of the War Staff in Commission. In carrying out this
function they will meet together for the discussion of questions which affect their
joint responsibilities.^83
The COS Sub-Committee acquired functions of co-ordination in
defence policy which had once been intended - but never secured - for its
parent, the CID. In this important re-organization of British defence
several factors deserve mention: Hankey played a leading role in creating
the new mechanism and secured a key post as its Secretary in the process.
The COS Committee - as it came to be known - represented a victory for
Trenchard, who had worked since 1919 for a forum in which he might
deal in a direct fashion and on an equal footing with his counterparts at
the War Office and Admiralty.^84 Thus Trenchard had good reason to
acknowledge his debt to Hankey, who in fact drafted the report of the
Salisbury Committee, in close consultation with the three chiefs.^85 From
the time of its first meeting on 17 July 1923 Hankey once again sat at the
very center of defence planning, acquiring what his biographer charac-
terizes asc powerful influence... if only because Chiefs of Staff came and
went, while he went on, seemingly, forever.'^86 Yet Hankey's influence did
not result from the periodic change in military leadership alone: rather he
provided an important link between those leaders and their civilian chiefs
in the Cabinet, and his long experience in civil-military relations
represented a positive asset for the COS Committee.
With the establishment of the COS Committee and the revitalization of
the CID, Hankey regained in institutional terms the personal influence
with the premier which he had lost with Baldwin's succession; and
although he lacked decisive influence on Baldwin, he did possess the
confidence of that other inter-war figure who 'went on, seemingly,
forever.' In fact, Hankey had little to complain of in his dealings with the
Tory leader, as recounted by Baldwin's biographers:


```
132 A man and an institution
```
Yet if there never was complete sympathy, there was complete confidence and
trust on both sides. Hankey's loyalty was total, his efficiency a bye-word. His
administrative value was too great to neglect... He found in Baldwin a readiness
to listen and a willingness to act, if he were once convinced; and within certain
limits they became friends... Hankey's influence at least ranked with that of
Warren Fisher and probably exceeded it where defence problems were con-
cerned; and it counted for considerably more than that of many Cabinet
ministers.^87

While it is true that Baldwin checked Hankey's advice against that of
others, so too had Lloyd George, whom Hankey had by no stretch of the
imagination dominated; thus the professional nature of the relationship
between the two did not differ markedly from those developed by
Hankey with other premiers whom he served, but the personal aspect of
the dealings between the two was simply less intense.
While Hankey did much to forward the institution of the COS
Committee, part of the impetus stemmed from his aversion to any
proposal to establish a Ministry of Defence, which organization he
viewed as superfluous in light of the co-ordinating mechanism afforded
by the CID. In evidence offered to the Salisbury Sub-Committee,
Hankey argued that defence was too comprehensive a concern to relegate
to a single ministry:
the means of co-ordination in the C.I.D. apply not only to the Service
Departments but to every Department of State which has any action to take on the
outbreak of war. In the larger questions of policy the Treasury, Foreign Office,
Colonial Office and India Office are involved only to a slightly less extent than the
Service Departments ... In the widest sense of the term this Committee [of
Imperial Defence] may be said to fulfill many of the functions of a Ministry of
Defence.^88
There is no reason to question Hankey's conviction that the CID afforded
a means of ensuring that Britain's defence organization 'should be
sufficiently elastic in character to focus ... all the resources of Empire,'
but his assurance is all the more remarkable, coming as it did at a time
when the CID was barely functioning. His skill in characterizing the
work of a Defence Ministry as narrower in scope than that of' defence by
committee' should also be remarked upon. Personally, Hankey did not
admit to the possibility of much tinkering with the extant defence
mechanism; when in 1926 Lord Esher weighed suggesting that the task of
co-ordinating the work of the CID be transferred from the premier to the
Lord President, Hankey objected that no other Cabinet member could
have the former's authority in dealing with his colleagues. Even more
telling was his belief that' if ever we have a war, the Prime Minister and
nobody else must undertake the supreme direction, and if he is to do that
he must educate himself up to it. The CID is the only means of education


###### The Secretariat in the 1920s: policies and procedures 133

###### we have.' To Esher's contention that the Prime Minister no longer had

###### the time to undertake such responsibilities, Hankey qua Cabinet Sec-

###### retary retorted that he had ' at least as much leisure as the Prime Minister

###### before the war,' provided he did not take on another office as well.

###### Because of his own combining two secretarial posts, Hankey continued:

###### ' the opportunities of discussing Cabinet business are equally available

###### for the discussion of C.I.D. business. This I can say definitely, that for

###### once I saw Asquith in pre-War days I see Baldwin twenty times in post-

###### War days.' Nor for the last time, Hankey specified his own unwillingness

###### to serve any other defence organization: ' In fact I should not hesitate to

###### go if there was any considerable change.'^89

###### The CID Secretary thus poured his efforts into making a success of the

###### COS 'troika,' in the face of constant inter-service rivalry for declining

###### defence expenditures - an understandable conflict exacerbated by War

###### Office and Admiralty resentment with the' extravagance' of Trenchard's

###### commitment to the doctrine of strategic air bombardment. In all this

###### strife, the service chiefs were at least talking with one another, no mean

###### accomplishment; thus Hankey found value in their meetings, even if he

###### had yet another set of minutes to supply, and complaints to resolve about

###### their form. Pressed by Trenchard for a fuller version, Hankey professed

###### his willingness to supply 'the sort of record which the Chiefs of Staff

###### would themselves like to have,' although he added that only the briefest of

###### records could be kept for any discussion of war plans. He proposed a two-

###### tiered system for other discussions, with full minutes going to the COS

###### and a shorter version sent to those on the distribution list of the parent

###### CID.^90 Hankey, it appears, recognized the likely contentiousness of the

###### fuller version,^91 but over the years such a format won out, and the records

###### of the COS Committee serve above all to depict the disagreements of the

###### chiefs as they struggled to shape a comprehensive policy which fitted the

###### priorities of their respective services.^92

###### With the defeat of the Tories in December 1923, Hankey's thoughts

###### gravitated to the vital issue of the attitude which a Labour government

###### would take to the existence of the CID; nor for that matter could he take

###### for granted acceptance of the Cabinet Secretariat. To resolve these

###### questions, Hankey called upon Ramsay MacDonald even before

###### Baldwin's defeat in the House of Commons. Some months later, he

###### recollected the details of that meeting, in a diary entry which indicates

###### gathering doubts about the propriety of such a record as he had kept for

###### nearly a decade:

###### My journal lapsed for nearly a year, partly because I had an attack of writer's

###### cramp at that time, partly because I cannot write of what happens at Cabinet

###### owing to my Oath as Clerk of the [Privy] Council, partly because I am still trying


```

```
in a desultory way to continue my work on the Higher Command in war, but
mainly from sheer laziness.
Although these concerns collectively weigh upon the contents of his
diary, he periodically collected his reflections on happenings in a fashion
which suggests that the Oath taken in 1923 was not decisive.^93 For the
moment, he recorded' a number of peculiar circumstances' attending the
likely formation of a Labour government, including such ironies as the
need to name MacDonald a Privy Counsellor before he could be asked to
form a government. He noted as well the substantive matters in his first
conversation with the Labour leader:

After discussing the Privy Council arrangements I passed on to the Cabinet
Secretariat. I said I did not know whether he proposed to have a Cabinet
Secretary, but that in any event I recognized it to be a very personal matter, and if
he wanted someone else I begged him not to consider my personal feelings. I
should not take umbrage if he appointed someone else. He replied very frankly
that he had made many personal inquiries about me, and had heard nothing but
good of me, and he begged me to remain, and added that he hoped we should
become friends as well. After describing in some detail the work of the Cabinet
Secretariat I passed (with some trepidation) to the Committee of Imperial
Defence. Rather to my surprise he displayed a good deal of interest, and, pointing
to his bookshelves, he told me that General Smuts had said that he possessed one
of the best military libraries in London. He promised me every support in the
C.I.D. He then went on to discuss very frankly his difficulties in finding Labour
Ministers suited to take charge of the three Service Departments, and in
particular pressed me for details as to how far as Prime Minister he could expect to
control their policy. I told him through the medium of the C.I.D. he could do a
good deal.^94

Hankey could not have hoped for a better light in which to view the
activities of the CID, surely an exhilarating experience in view of the
possibility that the best-known pacifist of a decade earlier might reject
outright the idea of military planning.^95 And in fact MacDonald followed
through, taking the chair at the first meeting of the CID under his
administration; while the press of other business would prevent his acting
frequently as chair, he announced that' the interests of Imperial defence
would be adequately safeguarded by the appointment [in his stead] of
Lord Haldane, who, as the Committee well knew, possessed unique
experience in matters of this nature.'^96 Since the Prime Minister attended
only two of the subsequent nine meetings during his first administration,
Haldane's appointment was from Hankey's point of view crucial: 'I feel
sure you must feel glad that you took the plunge and entered the Labour
Government,' he wrote in August 1924; 'had you not done so, I believe
that we would have had something like disaster on the defence side.'^97
The survival of the CID helps to explain Hankey's enthusiasm for the
succession of Ramsay MacDonald, which otherwise can be explained
only in terms of the Cabinet Secretary's being 'taken in by MacDonald's


```
The Secretariat in the 1920s: policies and procedures 135
```
```
eloquence and personality.'^98 Even if that be the case, Hankey was neither
the first nor the last to succumb.
On 22 January 1924 MacDonald was asked by George V to form a
government, and the Cabinet Secretary discussed the 'brave new world'
of Court etiquette with the Labour leaders that very day. When he
learned that the new premier had made no dinner arrangements, Hankey
proposed dinner at the United Services Club, to which he belonged; he
obviously enjoyed the ensuing scene:
As it chanced, the only vacant table was in the far corner of the big dining room.
We had to walk past a number of tables occupied by retired Colonels and
Admirals of highly correct Tory politics. Many of them looked at us open
mouthed, pausing twixt cup and lip as I filed down the room followed by the tall,
frock-coated figure of the new and sinister Labour Prime Minister. That he
should dine in their club on his first night in office!"
```
Hankey's wry sense of humor is in evidence, and in fact the military had
very little to fear from a minority Labour government. Nor had Hankey
anything to fear from MacDonald, and the two men took readily to one
another: in effect, he and Tom Jones exchanged places as the premier's
personal confidant. Hankey was delighted with the 'excellent personal
relations,' visiting MacDonald at Chequers as he had often done with
Lloyd George, but Jones was downcast by the turn of events. For his part,
Jones hoped to secure 'one of the big Permanent Secretary-ships,' most
likely at the Board of Education, for which he was well qualified.
However, his role as speech writer for Baldwin was no secret,^100 and as
recently as November 1923, The Times had printed a picture of the
Deputy Secretary walking through the fields with Baldwin at Astley
House, his Worcestershire residence; Jones' diary entry is a candid one:
' Pleased but also rather vexed [with the publicity] because I have a first-
rate record for anonymity during the seven years of work for the Prime
Ministers. Then so many, especially in Wales, will not understand how a
Civil Servant does his best for his Chief, whatever the politics of the said
Chief.'^101 Though Hankey did not record the incident, surely he thought
it conveyed the wrong impression, given his insistence upon the Cabinet
Office avoiding the attention of the press.^102
Disappointed by his failure to secure such a post, Jones held Hankey
partly accountable, although he recognized that the Treasury heads - he
specified Warren Fisher, who advised on such appointments - had been
'dead against' his going to the Board of Education. Yet by Jones' own
account, based upon what Hankey told him, his chief had mentioned his
aspirations to the King and twice to the Prime Minister, although the
latter did not 'rise' to the proposal. When Jones learned from his chief
that MacDonald had concluded that he ought to continue at the Cabinet
Office, he rather petulantly, and inaccurately, noted in his diary that


```
136 A man and an institution
```
```
Hankey had not' lifted a finger to help... The result is that I revert to the
post I had when I came here, of being Secretary to Cabinet Committees,
and, as I understand, have nothing to do with the new Prime Minister.'^103
Jones' subsequent enmeshment in the tortuous but interesting Irish
boundary negotiations eased his accommodation to the new pattern, and
in any event MacDonald did not long remain in Downing Street.
Despite the collective inexperience of the new Labour ministers, the
formalities of their accepting office proceeded to Hankey's satisfaction,
although the Webbs claimed to discern 'a hitch' in the arrangements
which he had made.^104 From the first, the Cabinet Secretary's relations
with the formidable Webbs were strained, although Beatrice Webb
marked well those qualities which enabled him to discharge his res-
ponsibilities, following upon his week-end visit at Passfield Corners:
```
```
An attractive personality, trusted and liked by all Cabinets in succession for the
good reason that he likes them and is absolutely loyal and amazingly appreciative
of the different statesmen he serves. A simple-minded soldier of the conventional
type, devout Christian, a puritan in habits, a perfect gentleman in manners. He
assumes that the men he serves are public-spirited however they may differ in
opinion and capacity. He has plenty of shrewd intelligence, but no intellect;
abundance of good temper but no wit; irony or sarcasm would, I think, be
inconceivable on his own part and somewhat unintelligible in others... Hankey,
like other simple-minded persons, mistakes power over other people for real
distinction of thought and feeling. But this lack of censoriousness - this slightness
of critical facility, combined with absolute integrity, kindliness and loyalty and
quickwittedness, make him an ideal secretary to Cabinets. If ever a man was
perfectly suited to his job it is Maurice Hankey.^105
```
The condescension for which Beatrice Webb was well known is apparent
in her description of Hankey's intellectual shortcomings, but it is unlikely
that the Webbs would care to discuss those matters - in a word, defence -
about which Hankey thought deeply and possessed a critical facility
which far outpaced 'simple-mindedness.' That Hankey was at the least
uncomfortable in the company of the Webbs is apparent in a pained note
to his wife, who had sought his instruction concerning another social
engagement:' I think you had better accept the Sidney Webbs, though I
shall hate it.'^106 Incidentally, Tom Jones fared no better at Beatrice
Webb's hands, despite his Fabianism and genuine interest in education
and research; all his experience 'has not given him any insight into public
affairs, superior to that of the clever student or professor of public
administration. Of course he can give you tid-bits of political gossip; but
with regard to the problems themselves he knows less than many persons
who are excluded from the inner circle.'^107
The Labour government showed no hesitation in accepting the mode
of secretarial arrangements evolved by predecessor regimes: the Cabinet
instructed its Secretary to record Conclusions only, 'with such ex-


###### The Secretariat in the 1920s: policies and procedures 137

###### planatory notes as are essential to render the Conclusions intelligible.'^108

###### Ministers were responsible for communicating relevant decisions to their

###### own departments. Labour did innovate in requesting the Secretary to

###### give to the press a list of ministers present ' as soon as the Cabinet has

###### assembled.' A week later, that charge was broadened to include the

###### Secretary's taking 'the instructions of the Prime Minister as to the issue

###### of a Communique to the Press in regard to the business discussed.'^109 It

###### appears that the Labour Cabinet had concluded that an official statement

###### of Cabinet business was preferable to the possibly inaccurate summations

###### of a score of ministers, many of whom had no experience in dealing with

###### the press in an official capacity. In view of these developments - Hankey

###### had to dislike them, because he had altogether eschewed dealings with the

###### press - his memory played him false when he recalled, a quarter-century

###### later, that only one minor innovation had marked Labour's accession:

###### The old [Cabinet] convention was 'No Smoking before lunch.' It was observed

##### until 1924 when MacDonald renewed it at the outset of his first meeting. But J. H.

###### Thomas came in later and knowing nothing of the rule, continued to smoke. Soon

###### others lit their pipes, and the rule vanished - to the intense discomfort of non-

###### smokers.

110

###### Despite the centralization of Cabinet contact with the press, ministers

###### went their own way, and several leakages occurred: already in February,

###### press reports of naval matters caused the premier to appeal to his

###### colleagues to exercise their 'gravest discretion'; in the following month,

###### an apparently deliberate leakage took place at the Admiralty, whose

###### service personnel were distressed by the government's aversion to the

###### construction of a great naval base at Singapore.^111 In due course, such

###### Convinced of the soundness of the ' very elaborate precautions...

###### the main responsible; he recommended the Treasury practice of circulat-

###### must see it, in a special box.'^113 Nonetheless, the Cabinet Secretary

###### continued to acknowledge that secrecy at the departmental level could be

###### overdone: 'Effective administration depends so often not only on

###### knowledge of the decisions, but of the policy behind the decisions, which

###### may react into ever so many questions. If your officials do not know the


```
138 A man and an institution
```
policy they will not be good administrators, and will often fail to give
advice consistent with the broader policy.'^114 Hankey's pragmatism, even
in regard to Cabinet secrecy, led him to accept the Treasury's request in
1924 that two sets of Conclusions be sent, because the Chancellor,
Churchill, liked on occasion to take them with him, leaving the office
'embarrassed by not being able to ascertain what decisions have been
taken.'^115 Three years later, he favored similar treatment for the Foreign
Office, but he added that any other requests ought to be turned down,
because leakage had in the past stemmed from too many departments
receiving additional copies.^116 On one point the Cabinet Secretary was
adamant: Cabinet Conclusions were not sent abroad to ministers.^117 For
all his care, Hankey could not control the ' political' aspect of Cabinet
leakage: in any Cabinet, differences of opinion exist, despite the doctrine
of collective responsibility. Such differences yield to political pressures in
disregard of the principle of Cabinet secrecy, with the press serving as
conduit for the information: 'The result is that Government and
Opposition leaders recognise the need to disregard up to a point in
practice the principles of secrecy; while dissidents are only too anxious to
do so.'^118 From this reality, there is no escape for the Cabinet Secretariat.
Hankey strove as well to improve the procedural practices of Cabinet
government. Labour's Attorney-General, Sir Patrick Hastings, called to
his attention the fact that the Law Officers were not adequately consulted
about the legal aspects of government bills brought to Parliament; after
Hankey's mediation, the Cabinet agreed that whenever a minister
intended to submit 'an important question of policy involving legis-
lation,' he should arrange prior notification of the Law Officers. Further,
at the Prime Minister's invitation, they might be brought into Cabinet for
the discussion of the proposal, and, in any event, they were to receive
copies of the relevant Conclusions.^119 In less than a month's time, a
procedural anomaly of some significance had been laid to rest. The first
Labour government undertook another step in regularizing Cabinet
procedure: in April 1924 the Cabinet ruled that, with only the most
pressing exceptions,' a question should be placed on the Cabinet Agenda
providing the Minister initiating a subject has circulated his Mem-
orandum at least 5 days prior to the meeting of the Cabinet.'^120 These
memoranda should deal with parliamentary considerations and pass the
scrutiny of the Home Affairs Committee before they were circulated to
the Cabinet. When the Conservatives returned to office later in the year,
they accepted these arrangements, subject to the Prime Minister's
approval; thus they were satisfied with the effectiveness of these
guidelines, which had been violated consistently only by the Foreign
Office. In November 1924, a Treasury Minute codified the sequence
whereby ministerial initiative secured Cabinet approval: the Secretariat


###### The Secretariat in the 1920s: policies and procedures 139

###### would distribute memoranda only' after their subject matter has been fully

###### examined between [sic] the Departments from which they emanate, the

###### Treasury, the Law Officers where contentious Bills are involved, and

###### other Departments concerned, and these documents will bear on the face

###### of them a specific statement that this examination has taken place.'^121 In

###### sum, a short-lived Labour regime had contributed significantly to

###### Cabinet procedure.

###### Such developments help to account for Hankey's pleasant discovery

###### that the personnel of the Labour government composed a 'more

###### business-like Cabinet' than any he had ever worked with:

###### They read their papers and get up their subject, and, on the rare occasions where

###### they do not complete their agenda, meet either the same afternoon or next day to

###### finish up. There is never any accumulation of Cabinet business, and it is the first

###### time I have ever known such a state of affairs in the seven years I have been at this

###### work.^122

###### The Cabinet Secretary credited Labour's use of Cabinet committees to

###### deal with specific problems; he recognized that the Labour leaders were

###### drawing upon their experience in serving upon similar committees

###### established by party headquarters to examine various subjects.^123 Hankey

###### assigned much credit directly to MacDonald, who had proved 'an

###### admirable head of the Cabinet,' although the Cabinet Secretary ques-

###### tioned his assumption of too great a responsibility: 'The trouble is ...

###### that no man, or super-man, can really carry the affairs of two such heavy

###### Offices as Prime Minister and Secretary of State [for Foreign Affairs], at

###### any rate while Parliament is sitting... Moreover, the signs of overwork

###### in our Prime Minister are at times rather distressing.'^124 His initial

###### enthusiasm for the Labour leader had been reciprocated, as MacDonald

###### queried Hankey's views on a range of topics and encouraged him to

###### resume his private diary.^125

###### That activity occupied Thomas Jones too, and his diary, like Hankey's,

###### has become a valuable source for the study of the period in which he

###### served as Deputy Secretary. Delighted to discover that Hankey kept a

###### diary ' in a stoutly bound locked book, the first I had ever seen,' Jones

###### claimed a functional rationale for his diary:' I was sometimes involved in

###### confidential exchanges with opposed parties during labour and other

###### disputes, or in secret conversations with Ministers. I then felt the need for

###### written proof that I had faithfully interpreted the instructions of my

###### principals.'^126 Neither man disguised the fact that he was keeping a

###### private record of his public activities; Hankey claimed, later in life, that

###### all the Prime Ministers whom he served knew of and encouraged his

###### keeping a diary.^127 The conclusion is inescapable: what a later generation

###### of civil servants viewed with extreme distaste was sanctioned within the

###### context in which Hankey and Jones operated. That the precedent Hankey


###### 140 A man and an institution

###### forged has been disavowed by others ought not to weigh against his

valuable record.

###### In the meantime, Hankey's role deepened when MacDonald - his own

###### Foreign Secretary - turned his attention to the settlement of German

###### reparations as a step towards general European stability. In deciding first

###### to summon the former Allied powers to the London Conference on

###### Reparations, MacDonald hoped to reach an agreement which would in

###### turn be presented to the Germans. The Prime Minister valued Hankey's

###### experienced hand in dealing with such deeply rooted problems; when the

###### Foreign Office insisted that Hankey serve as Secretary-General, he was

###### bound to work closely with MacDonald:

###### I became what I had not intended to become - the principal adviser and

###### counsellor to Ramsay MacDonald. I had gone to the [United Services] Club to

stay during the Conference, as I could not keep my grip on all its activities at home

- and the family had gone to St. David's in August. Ramsay's family had also gone

###### to Scotland; his cook went off, and thereafter we had all our meals together at the

###### Club. Thus it came about that we were thrown together in great intimacy. When

###### Parliament arose his colleagues left town and I was almost the only friend he had

###### left. For the last ten days of the Conference we were almost inseparable.

###### MacDonald worked in almost as irregular a way as Lloyd George - often seeing

###### people early in the morning and late at night. The Foreign Office men, working

###### from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. and then going home, were not much use to him for his

```
erratic methods. I, having nothing else to do, living at the Club, feeding with him
and fully in his confidence naturally became his assistant and abetter. This was all
the more so since he and Snowden, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who was his
```
###### principal colleague in the Conference, did not hit it off and could not work

together. Thus it happened that, while the Foreign Office people did the technical

###### part on Committees and so forth very admirably, the more delicate diplomatic

###### negotiations on points of high policy, and on irreconcilable differences of

opinion, passed more and more into my hands so far as MacDonald let go at all.^128

###### Hankey's role had come full circle: less than two years after the Cabinet

###### Secretary had been relegated to secretarial tasks, he had re-emerged as a

###### close confidant to the Prime Minister, working at a considerable remove

###### from his formal responsibilities. If the crisis of 1922 had contained a

###### lesson, there is no sign that Hankey perceived the wisdom of avoiding

###### conference responsibilities, nor of maintaining a certain distance from the

###### Prime Minister.^129 To the contrary, he was willing again to function as a

###### right-hand man. At the same time, he had again claimed a central role in

###### defence planning: Sir Maurice functioned both as man and as institution,

###### a formidable combination. While the Cabinet Secretariat may have

###### eschewed the 'limelight' in the wake of 1922, the Cabinet Secretary

###### himself did not seek obscurity in the wings.

###### Yet the 'honeymoon' period for MacDonald and Hankey began to

###### dissipate - unnoted at the time - during the Reparations Conference. His

confused, evasive, and misleading response to the unfolding scandal of
the Campbell case - 'the silly little issue of the Campbell prosecution'
was Beatrice Webb's rueful description^130 - discredited and ultimately
felled the first Labour government. The proceedings raised a question
about Ramsay MacDonald's fitness for high office; Hankey discovered
behind the hale exterior of the man risen from the people some troubling
traits. The Cabinet Secretary loyally served MacDonald upon his return
to Downing Street in 1929, but the deep disappointment cannot have
been forgotten.
Only certain features of the Campbell case can be treated, because our
concern remains with the implications for the Cabinet Secretariat of the
actions on the part of the Prime Minister and his colleagues. On 25 July
the Communist party newspaper, Workers' Weekly, published an ' Open
Letter' to the Fighting Services, steeped in revolutionary rhetoric and
appealing for class solidarity.^131 Asking for the organization of'commit-
tees in every barracks, aerodrome, and ship,' as a first step in concerting' a
common attack upon the capitalists and [to] smash capitalism for ever and
institute the reign of the whole working class,' the party letter came to the
attention of the military authorities, who urged an appropriate response.
The Director of Public Prosecutions and the Attorney-General, Sir
Patrick Hastings, agreed that statute law had been broken by the appeal,
and the DPP secured a warrant for the arrest of the person responsible for
the issue in question, one John Campbell.^132 Even before Campbell's
arrest, the episode was raised in Parliament, when the Under-Secretary
for Home Affairs was asked how HMG intended to respond to a
document possessing 'a subversive character and calculated to disturb
and undermine discipline in His Majesty's Service.'^133 With the arrest of
Campbell, acting editor of the Workers' Weekly, several days later, the
government took a flow of questions from the Labour left; noting that
Campbell had accepted responsibility for a breach of the law, the
Attorney-General admitted surprise with the vehemence of the questions
from that quarter; as a result, he consulted with a spokesman for the
Labour left, James Maxton, learning only at that time that Campbell was
only acting editor and that he personally had an outstanding war record.
In the light of this conversation, Hastings regarded his initial decision' an
unfortunate mistake' because prosecution of a political nature' entails the
consideration of a great many elements, not the least being the personality
and antecedents of the individual to be charged.'^134
Nonetheless, formidable obstacles stood in the path of dropping the
charges: Hastings had first to inform MacDonald of this change of
opinion, suffering criticism from the Prime Minister both for the
initiation of proceedings and the willingness to abandon prosecution,
once undertaken.^135 Notwithstanding MacDonald - he explained later -


###### 142 A man and an institution

###### deferred to the Attorney-General, who as a Law Officer bore the

###### responsibility in the case and who had himself taken the initiative in the

###### proceedings. He invited Hastings to a Cabinet meeting later in the day, 6

###### August, because the Campbell case had assumed political importance.

###### Since Hankey was involved in the work of the Reparations Conference,

###### Thomas Jones took the minutes of that Cabinet meeting, and his several

###### accounts leave little doubt that following a full but rambling discussion,

###### the Cabinet was persuaded by the Attorney-General's review of the case.

###### The Attorney-General said he took full responsibility for proceeding with the

###### case, which disclosed a bad criminal offence, but inasmuch as it transpired that

###### the person charged was only acting temporarily as Editor and was prepared to

write a letter to that effect, steps could be taken not to press the prosecution in the

###### circumstances against this particular offender, if the Cabinet so desired.

###### After considerable discussion of the procedure which had led to action being

taken in the Courts without the knowledge of the Cabinet or the Prime Minister
the Cabinet agreed:

###### (a) that no public prosecution of a political character should be undertaken

###### without the prior sanction of the Cabinet being obtained.

(b) that in the particular case under review the course indicated by the Attorney-

###### General should be adopted.^136

###### So much for the Cabinet decision, but in this matter - because Jones

###### preserved the notes which he took during the discussion - we are far

better informed than is usually the case; although these notes are not free

###### from some internal confusion, they are quite consistent with the

###### Conclusions.^137 Prior to the Attorney-General's entering the meeting,

###### MacDonald complained that Hastings ought to have consulted him in an

###### obviously political matter; for his part, Hastings admitted that' in case of

###### great importance' he ought to consult the Prime Minister - the unstated

###### implication was that he had not perceived the Campbell proceedings in

###### this light. Noting the extenuating circumstances which he had recently

###### uncovered, the Attorney-General informed the Cabinet that there

###### existed 'a possible way out if you desire it against this man.' MacDonald

###### countered with a different preference:' I'd rather go through once started

###### than show white feather. If you stop prosecution you will be asked all

###### round what [you are] going to do.' At this point, the Cabinet decided to

###### instruct the Attorney-General to secure its prior approval for political

prosecutions.

###### The Cabinet discussion then returned to Campbell's offence, and

###### Hastings reiterated the extenuating circumstances, including: 'Man

arrested [Campbell] prepared to write a letter say he was [editor] only few

###### days.' On this point, according to Jones' notes, a decision was apparent:

###### Attorney-General: I'll accept his letter - reply being that we had to take

cognisance reluctantly.
Henderson [the Home Secretary]: More questions tomorrow.


```
The Secretariat in the 1920s: policies and procedures 143
```
Attorney-General: Steps have been taken. Nothing to add [presumably to such
questions as were raised in the House of Commons].
(Attorney-General authorised)^138
'Authorisation' in this context almost surely implies the Cabinet's
agreement to drop the prosecution, in response to Campbell's' letter,' but
such an item apparently never existed, and thereafter it disappears
entirely from Hasting's account. Nonetheless, such a document had been
a premise upon which the Cabinet had accepted Hasting's ' possible way
out'; on this point the Cabinet Minute is deficient,^139 although surely the
Attorney-General personally bore responsibility for its subsequent
collection. In the absence of further information, one may speculate that
James Maxton had suggested that such a ' letter' could be secured, which
gave the Attorney-General a rationale for his reversal of field.^140 Yet
another puzzling feature is that the Prime Minister apparently aban-
doned his fear of showing the 'white feather' as the discussion abruptly
ended; perhaps for him too the alleged' letter' represented the ' way out.'
How to explain the Cabinet's action? While one may question the
thoroughness of the discussion and resulting minute, there appears to be
no reason to challenge the explanation adduced three weeks later by the
Home Secretary, Henderson:

```
the Cabinet as a whole felt that proceedings against Campbell... would do more
harm by advertising the Communists than any harm which would follow the
publication of the article, and that it would appear that far more importance was
attached to the views and activities of the Communists than in fact they deserve.
This would have been the attitude taken by the Cabinet had it been consulted
before the proceedings were launched. It was recognized that a withdrawal of the
prosecutions would not leave the matter in the same position as if the prosecution
had not been started; but on the whole it seemed better to adopt this course rather
than let the trial of Campbell proceed to a conviction.^141
```
While the Cabinet asserted its right to intervene in a legal proceeding,
Hastings did not protest the action, nor did the Cabinet over-rule him, as
he had already reversed his position.^142 Management of the proceedings
again fell to Hastings, who properly assigned the task of informing the
court to a Treasury Counsel, Travers Humphreys, who did not care in
the least for his brief. Convinced that the grounds for withdrawal
advanced by Hastings were each deficient, Humphreys chose the least
weak among them, namely that the intent of the letter was not to seduce
men in the services from their duty, an interpretation bolstered by
Campbell's own military record. On 13 August he moved withdrawal of
the charge, accepting representations that Campbell intended only to
comment against the state's use of armed military force to suppress
industrial disputes.^143 Since Humphreys did not publicly link those
' representations' to the queries voiced by the Labour left in the House of


###### 144 A man and an institution

###### Commons at the end of July, the CPGB seized upon his statement to

###### suggest that the ' representations' had been made by such Labour leaders

###### as MacDonald, Henderson, and Clynes, who feared that they would be

###### called as defence witnesses because of their own past statements on the

###### use of military force in industrial disputes.^144

###### Against this backdrop of ambiguous 'representations' The Times'

###### leader of 15 August deplored any such action on the part of a Minister,

###### which would

###### constitute an interference by the Executive with the course of justice which

###### should not be tolerated by the people of this country. To arrest a man on a grave

###### charge and then to refuse, at the instance of someone, presumably in authority, to

###### disclose the evidence when the accused professes to have a good defence, is not

###### consistent with British ideas of justice. It undermines the confidence of the public

###### in the procedure of our Courts of Law.^145

###### Among those who expressed an interest in the case was George V, and in

###### the course of answering his inquiry, MacDonald learned of the Home

###### Office's insistence that they had no official knowledge of the reasons for

###### the withdrawal of the prosecution, because the Cabinet had acted. On 13

###### September the premier sought further information from the Attorney-

###### General, although his own secretarial staff apparently had not consulted

###### the Cabinet records in the interim.^146 Hastings promptly responded to

###### this second request, informing the Prime Minister that he had decided

###### against the prosecution of Campbell; he did not mention the Cabinet's

###### agreement to the action.^147 Armed with the information that Hastings had

###### throughout acted on his own authority, MacDonald chose to challenge

###### the Cabinet Minute in question, when it came to his attention.^148 No

###### coincidence, then, that on 22 September MacDonald, in the presence of a

###### number of Cabinet ministers, asked Hankey to show him the Cabinet

###### Minute dealing with the prosecution of the editor of the Workers' Weekly,

###### according to Hankey,' on reading the minute, the Prime Minister at once

###### challenged its accuracy, more particularly in regard to conclusion (b).'^149

###### As the Cabinet Secretary, who had not attended the meeting in question,

###### recorded no response to this allegation, MacDonald may have concluded

###### that his challenge had been sustained.^150

###### When the House of Commons reassembled a week later, MacDonald's

###### angered but impetuous response to a hostile parliamentary query

###### transformed an embarrassing incident into a budding parliamentary

###### crisis:^151 'I was not consulted regarding either the institution or the

###### subsequent withdrawal of those proceedings. The first notice of prose-

###### cution which came to my knowledge was in the press. I never advised its

###### withdrawal, but left the entire matter to the discretion of the Law

###### Officers.'^152 MacDonald's words left the impression that he had been in

###### no way involved, which his colleagues and the Cabinet Office knew was


The Secretariat in the 1920s: policies and procedures 145

inaccurate, although Hankey put a finer edge on the proceedings by
commenting that his statement was '"a bloody lie".'^153 The Cabinet
Secretary's use of what was for him a strong expletive was matched by a
resolute course of action, based upon a source which MacDonald likely
knew nothing about - Jones' own rough notes of the Cabinet meeting at
issue. Hankey's practice was to destroy such notes when the agreed
version of the Conclusions appeared, in order to ensure the secrecy of
what was said in Cabinet; in this case at least, Jones had acted
differently:
[On] ... 2 October, when Howorth told me that he understood that the Prime
Minister was challenging the accuracy of the Minute I had written on the subject
I dug out my rough notes on which the Minute was based, had them typed, and
went with them to see Hankey. He told me that on 22 September the P.M. had
said to him that the Minute was inaccurate. I asked him in what respect, and
Hankey could not tell me. He and Howorth read my rough notes and agreed that
on the evidence before them, the Minute was, if anything, an understatement. In
particular I had down 'A. G. authorised', whereas in the Minute I had used our
usual formula 'The Cabinet agreed.'^154

```
Strengthened by this particular phrasing - though the distinction is
puzzling - Hankey decided that he had sufficient evidence to press the
premier to make an exculpatory statement, thereby heading off a censure
debate. Concurrently, he sought to protect the integrity of Cabinet
record-keeping by attaching to the Cabinet Minutes for 6 August a note
of the Prime Minister's subsequent challenge.^155 The political storm
clouds gathering round the Labour government threatened to engulf the
Cabinet Secretariat: if MacDonald were to convince the Opposition
parties that he bore no responsibility for the handling of the Campbell
case, that success could come through his challenge to the credibility of
Cabinet Minutes.
To obviate that possibility, Hankey carefully compiled an account of
the way in which Cabinet Conclusions generally, and the Campbell
Conclusion in particular, were approved. To MacDonald's protestation
on 2 October that he could not remember having seen the minute in
question, Hankey reconstructed the events of 6-7 August in such a way as
to convince the premier that he must have seen it. According to Hankey,
Jones sought immediate approval of the draft minutes, since the Cabinet
was on the point of dispersing for holiday; Hankey's account of what
ensued illustrates the care with which the Cabinet Office operated:
Mr. Jones, however, was rather anxious about the particular Minute relating to
the Workers' Weekly, and he handed me a Note ... in the following terms: -
' Secretary.
For Prime Minister's approval. If he cannot look at all perhaps he would look at
No. 5 {Workers' Weekly).
T.J. 11.40 a.m.'
```

###### 146 A man and an institution

###### ... I have no precise note of the moment at which I obtained your approval. My

###### strong recollection is that this occurred at the House of Commons on the

###### conclusion of the Meeting of Heads of Delegations [to the Reparations

###### Conference] at^11 a.m.; that is to say, just before lunch. In fact, it must have been

so... there is a note in the Office that the draft Minutes actually left this Office for

##### circulation to the Cabinet at 3.20 p.m. Allowing over an hour for the final clerical

###### and manipulative stages of the reproduction and circulation of the rather long

###### Minutes of this Meeting, the office must have had authority to circulate

###### somewhere about lunch-time. I do not think there is the smallest doubt that I did

show you this Minute [in a footnote asterisked at this point, Hankey added,' Mr.
Tom Jones tells me that this entirely confirms his recollection, which is that at the

###### time I definitely informed him that the Prime Minister approved this particular

###### Minute.']. It is true that on some occasions, especially when I think there is no

###### matter of a doubtful or controversial character in the Minutes and you are very

###### preoccupied, I issue them on my own authority. But in this case a special form of

###### notice is attached to the draft, which indicates that they have not yet been

##### submitted for your approval. In the present instance, however, I have on the file a

duplicate of the notice which accompanied the Minutes. It is the normal notice for
an occasion on which the Prime Minister has seen the draft, and is couched in the
following terms:

###### 'The attached draft Conclusions are circulated by direction of the Prime

###### Minister. It is requested that any corrections may be communicated to the

###### Secretary not later than 12 Noon on Friday, 8 August 1924.'

###### No corrections were received. The fact that this form of notice was issued is a

###### proof that I was satisfied that you had read and approved the draft Minutes.

###### I would draw your attention to the form of the above notice. It invites every

###### member of the Cabinet to send corrections. The Distribution List shows that it

was sent, along with the Minute on the Worker's Weekly, to the Attorney-General

###### and the Solicitor-General. Neither of them criticized the Minute, nor did any

###### member of the Cabinet.^156

###### While Hankey's primary concern was the defence of his own operation,

###### his exercise also afforded MacDonald a means of dignified retreat from

###### his self-imposed dilemma. Hankey took care to cite the events which had

###### occupied the premier's attention, expressing his sympathy with 'an

###### observation of a general character which I have often heard you make...

###### that you objected to having documents pushed into your hands for

###### approval at a time when your mind was full of other matters.'^157 Was the

###### Cabinet Secretary suggesting in a tactful way that the Prime Minister

###### plead press of other business by way of apology for a faulty recollection?

###### To be sure MacDonald had complicated matters by his denial of

###### involvement, coupled to his challenge to the Conclusion, but an

###### admission of error - plausible in light of the Jones notes - could well have

###### cleared the political atmosphere. Certainly the Tory and Liberal leaders

###### would have been hard pressed to bring down a minority government

###### because of the Prime Minister's faulty memory: such grounds would not

###### give the appearance of a popular electoral issue.^158

###### Unwilling to admit his error, the Prime Minister chose to regard a

###### Liberal attempt to substitute an inquiry for the Conservative censure

```
motion as equivalent to a vote of no confidence in his administration;
when the Tories chose to support that parliamentary tactic, the doom of
the Labour government sounded. Even in the wake of the Conservatives'
return to power, Ramsay MacDonald professed to view the Campbell
incident as an 'extraordinary series of muddles,' lodging the respons-
ibility elsewhere: the Attorney-General had misunderstood his own
assertion that he must carry through any political prosecution, once
launched, and the Cabinet had shied from any attempt to intervene -
although they had discussed the matter 'from various points of view.'
The Cabinet Secretariat had played what was perhaps the key role, he
informed C. P. Scott some months later:

Hankey, the usual Cabinet Secretary, had been unable to attend and a substitute
had been employed to take the minutes who took them all wrong. When Hankey
brought them to MacDonald to be initialled he was in the midst of an important
discussion ... on a proposed London Agreement. MacDonald scolded him for
bringing them at such a time, contrary to his instructions, but Hankey persisted
and said he thought he should look at item 5. MacDonald, still impatient, said,
'Well, is it all right?' [to a man who had not attended the meeting] and Hankey
replied,' Yes, I think so.'' So I just initialled it,' said MacDonald and thought no
more about it. (The other members of the Cabinet all saw the minutes and no one
called them in question.) In fact, said MacDonald, they did not read them.^159

Apart from the slur on Hankey's role and that of the unknown
'substitute,' MacDonald's self-pleading does not convince: that no
member of the Cabinet, even on the eve of summer holiday, would read
the minutes exceeds the bounds of credibility. Yet MacDonald admitted
that his belated attempt to correct the minute appeared to be an after-
thought: ' There is only my word for it that it was not, which people can
believe or not as they please.'^160 Examined in the detail which the
existence of Cabinet records and the Jones notes make possible, it is no
longer possible to 'believe,' and MacDonald's attempt to extricate
himself from muddles and misunderstandings in which he had played a
leading role does not constitute a creditable chapter in his long political
career. The point remains that his actions indicate that he was prepared to
discredit the Cabinet Secretariat for errors committed by the Executive.
Nearly on the eve of their defeat in the Commons, the Labour Cabinet
expressed some bitterness with Cabinet Minutes, which was under-
standable if misjudged. Hankey shared their sentiments with Jones, who
recorded them in his diary:

They [the Cabinet] have been greatly worried not only about my Minute and my
rough notes on which the Minute was based but also on the fact that the Minute
had become widely known in some Departments. Apparently it was 'Roneoed',
i.e. multiplied. One Civil Servant who had seen it and seen the Prime Minister's
reply in the House of Commons... had gone to the 1st Lord and said the P.M.
was lying. This has naturally caused much fear and trembling ... In future I
gather even the summary of the discussion is to be dropped [it was not], and this


###### 148 A man and an institution

```
conclusion is not to be circulated but is to be paraphrased by the Minister to the
officials of his Department concerned. That was the view yesterday, but
Henderson prompted by Hankey urged the Cabinet not to scrap the present
system [because] they had got into trouble over a Minute and not to do so anyway
on almost their last day.^161
```
The Prime Minister too seized upon the circulation of the Cabinet
Minute dealing with the Campbell prosecution in his subsequent
chronicle of the sad affair, and he once more depicted the Cabinet
Secretariat's role as inept, explaining to C. P. Scott:

some military business had been dealt with [at the Cabinet meeting] and the
custom is that where any Departmental matter is dealt with a copy of the minute
relating to it should be sent to the Department concerned. On this occasion the
communication was sent to the Admiralty, but instead of the particular minute
alone the whole of the minutes were communicated including the erroneous one
about the Campbell affair. The Admiralty circulated them among the Navy and
Army chiefs and so the matter came to be known.^162

While internal procedures with regard to Cabinet Minutes at the
Admiralty left much to be desired, the balance of MacDonald's remarks
are nonsense, viewed in the context of Secretariat practices: in the first
place, the military authorities had a vital interest in the case, since they
had first called the Worker's Weekly appeal to the attention of the Law
Officers; surely the War Office and the Admiralty would be informed
concerning the disposition of proceedings. Even more tellingly, Hankey
commented that neither of the Law Officers criticized the terse minute
'nor did any other member of the Cabinet,' which could only mean that
the relevant Conclusion was routinely sent to all members of the Cabinet,
including the First Lord; indeed the whole of the Cabinet Minutes were
sent to all Cabinet ministers at this time. Ramsay MacDonald sought
sympathy at the expense of the truth.
On the day the first Labour government fell, Hankey oddly absented
himself from Whitehall Gardens, and thus Tom Jones wrote to him,
suggesting that he use his influence with the King to deny MacDonald the
dissolution which he was intent upon:' Don't you think in as much as (1)
we have a minority government and (2) no-one (except some Labour
men) wants an election, that the King should refuse a dissolution until he
has exhausted such alternatives, i.e., seen Baldwin and Asquith?'^163 In the
event, time proved too short for Hankey to play the role for which Jones
cast him, but it is not likely that the Cabinet Secretary would have been
well advised to intervene in a matter with weighty political overtones.
Nonetheless, it is interesting that George V felt as did Tom Jones,
privately recording his dismay that another election would be so soon
required.^164 Probably the basis for Jones' appeal was a conversation with
J.H. Thomas, who opposed such an election; as well, the Colonial
Secretary,' with the aid of the lurid language of which he is such a master,

###### possibility that the meeting became a non-event because MacDonald

###### wanted no record of what had been talked about. Beside one suggestion

###### made with regard to parliamentary tactics, MacDonald asserted: ' This

###### was a joke.'^166 No one has ever accused Hankey of an excess of levity in the

###### maintenance of Cabinet records, but it remains improbable that he would

###### not recognize intentional humor within the Cabinet. The Cabinet

###### Secretary recovered all but one copy of the' Minutes,' but the Secretariat

###### authenticated by the premier's own hand, despite instructions to the

###### contrary. Nothing ranked higher in the Cabinet Secretary's precise mind

###### than the integrity of Cabinet Office operations.

###### With MacDonald's subsequent willingness to use the Secretariat's

###### concerns surely mounted: what transpired in these months was far from

###### the overt, well-publicized attack which the institution had withstood in

###### 1922, but in a covert and ill-managed way a premier gave the appearance

###### of discrediting a body which deserved better of him. Precisely for the

###### must be regarded as a significant victory for an agency of Cabinet

###### the events of 1924 confirmed the independence of the Cabinet Office.

###### In the course of the ensuing electoral campaign, Ramsay MacDonald

###### was ill-served by senior civil servants within the Foreign Office.

###### Although the Cabinet Office was in no way involved - in fact, Hankey

###### took his holiday abroad, at a complete remove from the events centering

###### on the publication of the ' Zinoviev letter' - the fullest record of the


###### 150 A man and an institution

###### Cabinet's reaction occurs in Tom Jones' diary. On 10 October a copy of a

###### letter purportedly signed by President of the Comintern, Grigory

###### Zinoviev, and two of his associates on its Executive Committee was

###### received in the Foreign Office; addressed to the CPGB, the letter sought

###### ratification of the Anglo-Soviet trade treaties, an appeal couched in

###### appropriate revolutionary rhetoric. Despite its clearly controversial

###### nature, the bureaucratic mills ground slowly over the weekend, and four

###### days passed before the Northern Department received the copy.^167 In due

###### course it was forwarded, along with other papers, to Ramsay MacDonald,

###### who was electioneering; he rightly asked, on 17 October, for senior

###### Foreign Office officials to confirm its authenticity. Yet views differed: the

###### head of the Northern Department advised that it could not be easily

###### authenticated and advised against its publication; the Permanent Under-

###### secretary, Sir Eyre Crowe, thought it genuine and dispatched to

###### MacDonald his draft of an official protest to Russia. MacDonald revised

###### that draft, which he returned a week later to the Foreign Office, but

###### without his own initials, which he claimed to withhold until he granted

###### final approval. In the interim, another copy came into the possession of

###### the Daily Mail, which threatened publication if the government failed to

###### take action. With the elections only days away, Crowe decided, on his

###### own authority, that immediate publication was the least dangerous course

###### open to HMG, explaining in a letter to MacDonald:

###### What would have been the impression if - as would inevitably happen - it was

###### discovered that the Foreign Office had been in possession of the incriminating

###### document for some time, but had concealed this fact and had refrained from all

###### action? Would it not have been said that information vitally concerning the

###### security of the Empire had been deliberately suppressed during the elections,

###### which were meanwhile to be affected by Bolshevik propaganda?^168

###### So convinced was Crowe on the need for immediate publication that he

###### published the 'Zinoviev letter' and the British protest simultaneously,

###### without again consulting the Prime Minister.^169 Throughout this period,

###### the communications between MacDonald, on the hustings, and Crowe,

###### in Whitehall, were poor, although the Prime Minister later claimed that

###### at the time Crowe decided upon publication he was available on the

###### telephone. Yet Crowe's 'anti-Russian mentality' carried the day: 'He

###### had no intention of being disloyal,' the Prime Minister commented,

###### ' indeed quite the opposite, but his own mind destroyed his discretion and

###### blinded him to the obvious care he should have exercised.'^170 Although

###### MacDonald was prone to find others responsible for matters to which he

###### was a party, in this instance his depiction of his victimization is

###### persuasive: 'Nobody in the F.O. had 'phoned or wired,' he informed his

###### Cabinet,' or in any way communicated the fact of publication to him...

###### " I felt like a man sewn in a sack and thrown into the sea ". '^171


The Secretariat in the 1920s: policies and procedures 151

And for two days MacDonald sank silently in that 'sack,' although he
defended his inaction by claiming that, at this remove from the Foreign
Office, he lacked the information upon which to base a public expla-
nation.^172 As the Tory opposition fell upon what had come to be known as
the' Red Letter' in a flurry of patriotism, the Labour leader gave his party
no lead at all; only on the following Monday did he declare that the British
protest had been mistakenly issued, but by this time Labour's electoral
campaign had ground to a halt.^173 Although the degree to which this
variant on the post-war ' Red scare' influenced the election must remain
an open question, there is little doubt that the Labour Cabinet were
grievously disappointed with the results, which restored to the Con-
servatives a firm majority in the House of Commons. From the suspicion
that Labour had been done in by its opponents among the Civil Service
emerged the desire for an enquiry into recent events:
A group of the Cabinet, led by Parmoor, were ... all the time demanding an
inquiry which would table all the available evidence and expose our Secret
Service... Haldane insisted that if Parmoor had his way the result would be the
assassination of some of the instruments of the F.O. It is plain that Trevelyan [yet
another dissident] believed that Crowe and Gregory had stooped to a mean
political trick in order to damage the Labour Party, but the Prime Minister
rebutted any such suggestion with energy. He was certain that there had been no
bad faith. Subsequently the Prime Minister urged the importance of distinguish-
ing two questions:
a) The conduct of the Civil Servants;
b) The authenticity of the letter.^174
In an angry meeting, MacDonald resisted an examination of the first
matter, but a Committee of Haldane, Parmoor, Henderson and the Prime
Minister took up the second; Jones was instructed to make no reference in
the Cabinet Minutes 'to the Civil Service aspect of the business.' The
enquiry was pursued by the successor Tory regime; in mid-December
the Foreign Secretary, Austen Chamberlain, informed the Opposition in
an assured fashion that the' Zinoviev letter' was genuine beyond a doubt:
'It is suggested that the Foreign Office was hoaxed by some vulgar
imposture such as have been fabricated in various parts of the world. The
Foreign Office and our Secret Service have probably a closer knowledge
of these manufactories and manufacturers of forgeries than even hon.
Members opposite. We know them, and the fact that we know them is a
guarantee that we are not taken in.'^175 Yet the controversy simmered, and
in 1927 the Baldwin administration requested the Attorney-General, Sir
Douglas Hogg, to investigate the matter anew. So sensitive was the
question of authenticity that Hogg submitted no written report, and
Hankey recorded Hogg's conclusions in his own hand and kept that
sparse record in a highly secret category of Cabinet papers. Citing
circumstantial evidence, the Attorney-General expressed his opinion


###### 152 A man and an institution

###### that' the information was genuine,' although it could not be produced in a

###### Court of Law.^176 Obviously HMG relied upon secret sources of

###### intelligence.

###### Yet that 'official' view of the authenticity of the 'Zinoviev letter'

###### remains in dispute, although the recent emergence of variegated sources -

###### but not the actual records of the intelligence organizations - has served to

###### narrow the scope of historical disagreement concerning related matters.

###### While authenticity remains necessarily unproved, there is no longer room

###### for doubt that' the political bomb which exploded in the last days of the

###### Labour government was planted by the intelligence community'^177 - past

###### and present, acting in a common cause. In sum, the ' Zinoviev letter' was

###### deliberately manipulated by a number of hands to secure a political end,

###### namely Labour's defeat at the polls. Yet Foreign Office officials, with

###### several exceptions, and the successor Tory ministry found their belief

###### that the document was an intercepted Russian missive confirmed in

###### November 1924, by a confluence of independent sources of intelligence.

###### Officials of the Conservative Central Office likely found their rush to

###### publish the document justified; without apparent hesitation, they had

###### arranged a staggering payment from party coffers to the informant who

###### had supposedly placed a former MI5 official, Donald im Thurn, on the

###### trail of this piece of Bolshevik infamy.^178 Thus from a historical

###### perspective, the shocking aspect of the sordid electoral proceedings is the

###### joint intrigue of the intelligence community with leading Tory party

###### officials, including the chairman, Sir Stanley Jackson, and the treasurer,

###### Lord Younger, to ensure the publication of a document bound to

###### influence the latter stages of the campaign. Since the Tory officials

###### believed that the 'Zinoviev letter' was authentic, doubtless they con-

###### cluded that the use of party funds was an investment in the national

###### interest. Nonetheless, their machinations - two years after their party had

###### forced Lloyd George from office in part because he had flouted

###### standards of political morality - struck at those democratic institutions

###### which they feared the Bolsheviks would subvert.

###### The concern which gave rise to 'Red scares' accounts for the

###### enthusiastic acceptance of the 'Zinoviev letter,' and the Bolshevist

###### menace preoccupied the watchdogs of MI5 and Scotland Yard through-

###### out the early 1920s. Fear that a General Strike would produce the kind

###### of anarchy and chaos in which Communism would flourish led the

###### Baldwin government' to protect the people against any attempt at direct

###### action by revolutionary methods to put in an anti-democratic body to

###### control the people.'^179 Placed in charge of appropriate measures was

###### Baldwin's close political associate, J. C. C. Davidson, Chancellor of the

###### Duchy, who drew up measures which, in the case of a General Strike,

###### placed a Commissioner in charge of maintaining essential public services

in each of twelve districts. The scheme was a closely guarded secret,
which with the fall of Baldwin's first government posed a problem,
namely whether a Labour ministry could be taken into confidence
concerning the work of the Supply and Transport Committee. A
potentially divisive situation could eventuate:

the Chief Civil Commissioner [of the scheme], appointed under that government,
might well be a prominent trade unionist ... In this event, whoever was
appointed would at once become acquainted with all the machinery for quelling
that very crisis which he himself, when in opposition, may have done his best to
foment. In these circumstances, it is for consideration whether the organisation
had not better be wrapped in temporary obscurity and silence.^180

To circumvent the problem, the file of papers could be handed over to a
civil servant, rather than to Davidson's political successor, 'leaving it to
Hankey to raise the question of your successor [as Chief Civil Com-
missioner] with the Home Secretary of the new government.' Such a
conspiracy of silence Davidson wisely resisted, and he informed his
successor as Chancellor of the Duchy, his old friend Josiah Wedgwood,
that 'whoever was in power, it was his duty to protect the Constitution
against a Bolshevik-inspired General Strike.' He appealed to Wedgwood
not to destroy what he had done, nor to inform his Cabinet. The former
pacifist and radical Labour MP agreed not to interfere with the work
which had been done, and in November 1924 returned the plans to
Davidson:' I haven't destroyed any of your plans. In fact, I haven't done
a bloody thing about them.'^181 Whatever the wisdom of Wedgwood's
acquiescence, Davidson's refusal to use such highly placed civil servants
as Hankey to hide information and contingency plans from members of a
suspected regime is commendable.
The Cabinet Secretary could not have welcomed one of the Labour
government's final actions, when the Cabinet agreed to adhere to past
procedures regarding the custody of Cabinet papers: 'Ministers should
retain such Cabinet documents as they desire, on the understanding that
as ex-Ministers they could have access "to Cabinet minutes and other
documents issued during their term of office.'^182 By this time, Hankey had
on several occasions lost what he considered to be a vital element in the
preservation of Cabinet secrecy, although he noted that CID documents
fell into 'a different category' and were to be recovered. As for his role
during the Labour administration, he continued to function as an ad hoc
censor in the publication of official documents, advising in one case
against a Foreign Office desire to publish two documents dating from the
Paris Peace Conference in a projected Blue Book.^183 The authority of the
Cabinet Office went unchallenged in the historical realm of Cabinet
government.
The ' muddles' of the Campbell case and the hysteria associated with


###### 154 A man and an institution

###### the ' Zinoviev letter' ought not to leave the impression that Labour had

###### proved unable to conduct the affairs of government, but all was not

#### orderly in the last months of the regime - in contrast to the first few. What

###### has been described as ' a dangerous lack of administrative and political

###### cohesion' had been revealed by an investigation which Hankey was asked

###### to undertake into the proceedings of the Home Affairs Committee. In

###### particular the Law Officers were on occasion lost in the shuffle of Cabinet

###### business, but the root cause was political rather than administrative.^184

###### On balance, Hankey's initial satisfaction with the business-like ways of

###### MacDonald's Cabinet is confirmed in several sources; the most ex-

###### perienced member, Haldane, commented that the Cabinet worked hard

###### and was well prepared: 'They made their points briefly and forcibly,

###### trained to do so by Trade Union discipline, and MacDonald was an

###### excellent President. We always got through our business.'^185 Sidney

###### Webb credited the circulation of memoranda in advance of the Cabinet

###### meeting with the positive effect upon discussion and deliberation: ' This

###### practice, no doubt facilitated and developed by the existence of a Cabinet

###### Secretariat, has very largely relieved the Cabinet from speech-making,

###### and apparently enlarged its capacity for getting through business.' Yet

###### Webb's credit was tempered by a description of the Cabinet Secretary

###### which illustrates well how to damn with faint praise:

###### Hankey was admirable in every way; but not quite perfect. He made the Cabinet

###### minutes too full, putting in more than the bare conclusions come to; and not

###### completely realising the danger of their coming to light in politically hostile

###### hands. His knowledge of procedure and constitutional forms, though extensive

###### and ready to hand, was not quite complete. When he did, privately, make a

###### suggestion on policy, it was sometimes quite extraordinarily inept.^186

###### Implicit is Webb's dissatisfaction with the Secretariat's role in the

###### Campbell case, but no one knew better than Sir Maurice Hankey the need

###### to preserve secrecy for Cabinet documents, nor did anyone do more to

###### protect useful Cabinet Minutes from falling into the wrong hands. As for

###### his policy recommendations, several in the defence sphere failed to

###### persuade his Labour masters, but as we shall see they were hardly ineptly

###### prepared or argued.

###### With the return of the Tories to office, there is little need to comment on

###### Cabinet procedures, as these men had not yet been a year in opposition:

###### they were fully aware of the ways in which the Secretariat operated, and

###### in their initial meeting Baldwin's Cabinet specified that the Secretariat

###### should continue under the procedural instructions in effect since October

###### 1922. The regime was hostile to one of Labour's recent innovations,

###### deciding that 'the Cabinet should revert to the earlier procedure of

###### issuing only a list of names of those present, without any particulars of the


```

```
subjects discussed.'^187 In fact, Hankey had brought the press com-
munique to the new government's attention, stating forcefully in a
memorandum that he did not share MacDonald's belief that publicizing
the topics which the Cabinet had considered served a useful purpose. On
the contrary, ' in practice it was hardly ever found possible to do more
than list the subject discussed, but, even so, the list was often defective or
misleading - serious trouble could be caused in India or Egypt just by
mentioning the fact that they had been discussed. The meagreness of
such communiques defeated their purpose and engendered criticism.'^188
Hankey's memorandum secured its desired end.
Baldwin's second administration had to resort to unorthodox means to
deal with an undesirable compromise of Cabinet secrecy, rooted in the
propensity of a prominent Cabinet member to supplement his income by
writing signed articles for the press. While a member of Lloyd George's
coalition, the Lord Chancellor, Birkenhead, had written numerous
signed articles, but Bonar Law's ministry had frowned upon the use of
public office for private gain and 'agreed to refrain from the practice
indulged in by certain members of recent Cabinets, of writing signed
articles on current topics to the press during their tenure of office.'^189 The
Labour government did not contest the validity of the precedent,
although they were content to declare that all ministers should ' use their
discretion as to what they say whether speaking or writing publicly.'^190
Perhaps Birkenhead's keen legal mind fastened upon such an opening,
but he did resume the practice of contributing articles on a variety of
current topics when he assumed office as Secretary of State for India in

1924. Questions were asked in the House of Commons, and Baldwin
reiterated the convention that ministers were disbarred from writing
about public affairs; nonetheless, Birkenhead published further articles,
seemingly in direct defiance of the Prime Minister. Baldwin accepted
these as historical articles which the minister had already contracted to
write, and Birkenhead grudgingly agreed to bring his literary venture to
an end: ' Birkenhead yielded with an ill grace and nourished an abiding
grievance... He was prepared to submit to the ruling against political
articles, but failed to understand why Cabinet rank should disbar him
from writing on general subjects.'^191 Although his biographer-son
recognized that Birkenhead was motivated principally by the fact that' he
had always spent more money than he had earned,' apparently he was
unaware that the arrangement struck with Baldwin had a financial aspect,
namely that since Birkenhead had to give up the £5°°° pension to which
he was entitled as a former Lord Chancellor, Baldwin arranged to
compensate him with a sum of £10,000 from the ever-ready Conservative
party treasury.^192 Two payments were made in the course of 1926, yet in
the spring of 1928 he published an article declaiming against any


###### 156 A man and an institution

###### extension of female suffrage, a topic of current interest and controversial

###### nature. Baldwin managed to fend off parliamentary criticism by ac-

###### knowledging to an 'error of judgment' on Birkenhead's part, but the

###### latter had grown tired of office and politics, and in October 1928 he

###### resigned his last Cabinet post.^193 The immediate problem was eased, but

###### the members of Baldwin's Cabinet subsequently refused to disbar

###### themselves from replying to articles published by Opposition leaders,

###### dealing with domestic political concerns, so long as these ' supplemented

###### means already used for enlightening the public in regard to measures

###### before Parliament and other administrative measures.'^194 Since specific

###### reference was made to the 1923 Cabinet decision, we may infer that such

###### articles were not to be written for remuneration.

###### While Baldwin's second administration opted for Secretariat con-

###### tinuity, one particular innovation may have become institutionalized at

###### this time. Writing in 1927, Tom Jones asserted unequivocally: 'Although

###### Hankey writes a letter offering his resignation as Secretary of the Cabinet

###### when the Government changes, his resignation has never been accepted.

###### Hankey is an established Civil Servant but thinks it right to do this, owing

###### to the intimate personal relations which must exist between a Cabinet

###### Secretary and the Prime Minister.'^195 As Hankey's own diary records no

###### formal written letter of resignation either in 1922 or January 1924 - he

###### had orally announced his willingness to leave - the offer must be

###### associated with Baldwin's return to office. Documentation that such an

###### offer constituted a precedent binding upon his successors is unavailable.

#### One final item serves to link the deliberations of MacDonald's short-lived

###### Cabinet and its successor of much longer duration: on 3 December the

###### Tory Home Secretary, Joynson-Hicks, asked the Cabinet to determine 'to

###### what extent (if any) he and the Attorney-General could make use of the

###### Cabinet Minutes of the previous Government, and other documents in

###### which this Minute was referred to,'^196 in the event that the 'Campbell

###### case' was raised in Parliament. The Cabinet agreed that 'it was highly

###### undesirable and would furnish a most unfortunate precedent, to make

###### public in any form the text of the Cabinet Minute.' Here is the likely

###### genesis of the precedent that a ministry's papers were domestic only,

###### closed as a matter of course to its successors; as recently as 1966 Prime

###### Minister Harold Wilson applied the convention in noting that his

###### government could not even inquire concerning the existence of docu-

###### ments dating to 1956, involving the possible collusion among the British,

###### French, and Israeli governments in the Suez invasion:' the Government

###### can have no knowledge of any engagement of this kind which may have

###### been made by a previous Administration but which, in the nature of things,

###### can no longer be valid or operative.'^197 Yet with regard to the Campbell

###### prosecution, Hankey honored the instructions given him by the late


###### The Secretariat in the 1920s: policies and procedures 157

###### premier, MacDonald, to the effect that he should show his successor

###### certain papers related to the minute of 6 August if that particular minute

###### were discussed by a subsequent government; Baldwin himself read those

###### papers.^198 Apparently MacDonald had no notion that his adminis-

###### tration's Cabinet papers would as a matter of course be closed to

###### successor regimes, but surely the Conservative Cabinet's creation of a

###### convention was sound: to record Cabinet deliberations as grist for future

###### governments to mill for political purposes was not what record-keeping

###### was all about.

###### At this December Cabinet meeting the Baldwin government also

###### overturned their predecessors' hasty decision that prosecution of offences

###### of a political character could not be undertaken without the Cabinet's

###### prior sanction. The Home Secretary was instructed to convey this

###### revocation of 'certain instructions of their predecessors affecting the

###### freedom of action of the Attorney-General' to the concerned parties.^199

###### To the House of Commons, Baldwin criticized the partisan character of

###### the Labour Cabinet's position:' Such an instruction, in the opinion of the

###### [present] Government, was unconstitutional, subversive of the adminis-

###### tration of justice and derogatory to the office of Attorney-General.'^200 In

###### the crucible of this heated parliamentary exchange there was forged what

###### has been characterized as ' the modern exposition of the constitutional

###### position of the Attorney-General.'^201 Thus the otherwise lamentable

###### Campbell proceedings had the unforeseen but salutary effect of clarifying

###### the position of the Attorney-General within the administration and in

###### regard to the enforcement of the criminal law:' In exercising these duties

###### he is wholly independent of the Government, and is responsible only to

###### Parliament.'^202

###### For Hankey personally, the change of regimes opened anew the

###### problems of dealing with Stanley Baldwin other than on an official basis:

###### his deputy, Tom Jones, took his place as the premier's principal

###### adviser.^203 Yet the official relations between the Prime Minister and the

###### Cabinet Secretary showed no signs of strain: although he lacked direct

###### influence on the person, Hankey played a prominent role in the

###### organization of the nation's defences, in the main through the Committee

###### of Imperial Defence. Secretariat practices were by this time well

###### established, and the institution secure. One slight change in practices

###### centered on the occasional initiative taken by Baldwin's Private Secre-

###### taries, instructing the Cabinet Secretary to place certain items of business

###### on the Cabinet Agenda; Hankey continued to maintain that Agenda, and

###### the change reflects no more than requests in lieu of the daily contact with

###### Downing Street which he had hitherto maintained.^204

###### Baldwin was prepared to use the Secretariat in irregular ways; for

###### example, the Prime Minister smarted under the criticism by some Tory


158 A man and an institution

MPs that he had acted weakly in the events centering on 'Red Friday.'
While defending his actions at a party meeting, at the same time he sought
to use the Cabinet Secretariat for what could be called either educational
or propagandistic purposes. Whitehall Gardens was asked 'to prepare a
campaign to educate the country concerning the real issues involved in a
general strike.'^205 Since Hankey eschewed contact with the press, his
reluctance to involve the Cabinet Office must be assumed; because there
is no evidence of a 'campaign' mounted from those quarters, the collapse
of this particular project also appears likely. In the following year, the
industrial scene darkened, a General Strike took place, and the Secre-
tariat played only a minor role in countering the resort to industrial
action. While protracted negotiations were carried on by the mine owners
and the coal miners, Hankey had been at work drafting 'Emergency
Regulations 1926,' which were issued by royal proclamation at the end of
April, when negotiations collapsed. As the Trades Union Congress called
for strike action at midnight on 4 May, HMG responded with an
implementation of the measures which J. C. C. Davidson had developed
for the Supply and Transport Committee. Although these measures were
drawn up 'very much on the lines of Hankey's famous War Book,'^206 the
Cabinet Secretary played no part in their development. In his official
capacity he was thoroughly occupied, taking three crucial Cabinet
meetings on 2 May.^207 Personally he showed an open mind on the justice
of the miners' case, but the resort to industrial action found him resolute,
if hardly Churchillian, in his attitude:' It is going to be interesting seeing
if we can beat these fellows. I think we can, but it involves a big effort.'^208
Where Hankey's involvement was throughout functional, Thomas
Jones became deeply involved in the abortive negotiations, and sub-
sequently he attempted to influence Baldwin to moderate any govern-
mental over-reaction, such as he detected in the proposed Illegal Strike
Bill:
I told him that in my belief Eccleston Square [TUC headquarters] was already
beaten, and knew it was beaten, that it had taken some time to get the country to
appreciate what the General Strike was, but this new Bill would come as a
thunder-clap on the country which was utterly unprepared for it, and would
greatly confuse its mind.^209
In broadening his effort to avoid forcing a profound change in ' the quiet
peaceful temper of the men now on strike,' Jones contacted a number of
influential people, including Sir Warren Fisher and Hankey; the latter' in
his unemotional way said he rather felt the thing was being hurried, but
told me that Saturday's Cabinet was unanimous.'^210 Nonetheless, the
Cabinet did not proceed to immediate legislation, but instead adjourned
discussion for three days, in the meantime stating the belief that existing
law made any general strike illegal. With more legal force, Mr Justice


The Secretariat in the 1920s: policies and procedures 159

Astbury made much the same point in Chancery on the nth, and within a
day the General Council of the TUC withdrew support from the General
Strike, although the miners carried on their courageous albeit futile
struggle for many months. For all his centrality in the Baldwin
administration, Tom Jones preserved a sense of humor and a perspective
on those with whom he dealt, 'warts and all,' on a daily basis; these
features lend a human aura to his dealings and to his diary:

If only I could take myself so seriously [as had Col. House in his published
account] I might persuade posterity of my importance in the scheme of things.
But I can't - that is why there are so many and such long gaps in this story. I have
been consulted in the making of Cabinets. Indeed I am consulted by the present
Prime Minister almost every day on matters small and great ... I've discussed
matters of State in lavatories with three Prime Ministers [MacDonald, it appears,
excluded]. If I scratch my head long enough, I shall be able to recall quite a
number of momentous happenings.^211

Yet his diary supplies such events no less than the every-day business of
government and stands as a vital source for those years when he was close
to the premier.
During the second Baldwin government, a novel form of 'leakage'
threatened the Cabinet Secretariat, as two burglaries of Whitehall
Gardens were attempted; Hankey recorded the apprehension of the
culprit in the second instance,^212 possibly to acquaint the Cabinet with
the need for improved security. Certainly the curiosity of the press posed
the graver threat to Cabinet secrecy, and Hankey still viewed the
individual 'indiscretion' as the most likely source. For him, Lord
Beaverbrook and the Daily Express were prime suspects: in February
1926, Hankey was confronted with a leakage which led him to query the
President of the Board of Trade:' Where did Lord Beaverbrook spend his
weekend?'^213 The corollary is clear: 'And with which Cabinet Ministers
did he spend it?' Yet another threat to Cabinet secrecy stemmed from
revelations of past Cabinet discussions by former ministers, which the
Cabinet Secretary had attempted to stem for the post-war period. In
1927, however, there arose a current issue, namely the question of British
rearmament, which had led to the resignation from the Cabinet of
Viscount Cecil. Convinced of the correctness of his action, the great
League of Nations advocate was determined to justify his resignation by
publishing a letter which drew upon recent Cabinet discussions. Hankey
viewed Cecil's draft letter with extreme misgivings, concerned that it
would damage the present government as well as compromise the absolute
privacy within which Cabinet business ought to be conducted.^214
Typically, Baldwin was reluctant to intervene, but he permitted Hankey
to discuss his views with the elder statesman, Balfour. Encouraged in that
corner, Hankey assumed the responsibility for checking the several


160 A man and an institution

successive drafts composed by Cecil to meet the Cabinet Secretary's
criticisms. After several go-rounds, Cecil decided to forego a discussion
of Cabinet deliberations; Hankey was momentarily disappointed because
he was certain that the government reply, which Baldwin had left in his
hands, along with those of the Foreign Secretary, Austen Chamberlain,
would have 'smashed Cecil's whole case to smithereens,' but he
recognized that Cecil's expurgated version should be accepted 'in the
public interest.'^215 Securing the King's permission to publish the
exchange, Hankey brought the untidy incident to a satisfactory - albeit
temporary - conclusion. Austen Chamberlain perceived the difference
between Hankey's resoluteness and the Prime Minister's inaction:' I can
only say that Hankey was a brick as always, but I do not think it fair of the
Prime Minister to leave a matter of this personal character to be dealt with
by others.'^216
Hankey maintained a full record of the events surrounding Cecil's
resignation, anticipating that the latter might use the traditional forum
for an oral explanation of his resignation, when Parliament reassembled.
From Hankey's point of view, that privilege ought to have ruled against
Baldwin's permitting Cecil to submit a letter of resignation; Balfour had
agreed with the Cabinet Secretary, contending that 'the proper course
was for a Minister to give the reasons for his resignation in Parliament
where he could be answered if necessary.'^217 While Baldwin evaded the
force of that argument, he did take the trouble to commend Hankey for
his efforts in terms which are not typical of the exchanges between the two
men: 'Your delightful letter gave me great pleasure, increased, if
possible, my respect for you, and certainly made me more than ever
grateful, I left you a most tiresome task and nobly have you accomplished
it.'^218

With the Secretariat nearly a decade old, Hankey and the Cabinet Office
derived satisfaction not only from its survival and development but also
from the expressions of interest voiced from abroad. Following such a
show of interest by the French government, Hankey drew up in July 1925
a memorandum on the work of his body, in order to enable the French to
develop a mechanism to ensure liaison among ministries. In recom-
mending that the Prime Minister approve the dispatch of Hankey's
memorandum, which was couched in generalities, Austen Chamberlain
felt impelled to add his own views about the success of the British
prototype, in which he paid warm tribute to the Cabinet Secretary:

The continuance of the Cabinet Secretariat after the war led to some criticism,
but this has entirely ceased. Successive Governments have experienced its utility
and become convinced of its necessity in the ever-growing pressure and
complexity of the work of administration. But the question of its success in the


```

```
initial stage was largely a question of personality. The Secretary of the Cabinet is
now recognized by all Departments as a friend who helps to get their business
properly considered and promptly decided, and by the Prime Minister as an
agency without whose help it would be impossible for him in present-day
conditions to maintain his general right of supervision and control over all aspects
of Government policy. The secret of this success has lain in the fact that the
Secretary 'is never in the way and never out of the way!' He never obtrudes an
opinion unasked and is always helpful when consulted.^219
Baldwin endorsed Chamberlain's ' admirable description,' which became
a part of the cover letter sent to the French along with the memorandum.
Results followed quickly, as The Times reported on 5 October that a
reform of the personal secretariat of the President of the Council of
Ministers 'will make it an exact replica of the British Cabinet Secretariat
in Whitehall-gardens.'^220
Two years later, Hankey and Jones conferred with J. Burgon Bicker-
steth, an associate of Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King,
concerning the establishment of an office to assist the premier in his
duties. When Jones noted that his functions included speech writing for
the Prime Minister - nearly all save what he described as Baldwin's
literary speeches - Bickersteth pointed to the desirability of 'the
distinction between the Cabinet office or Secretariat and the Prime
Minister's personal staff,' a distinction substantially blurred by Jones'
own role as confidant. Hankey did not concern himself with the anomaly;
instead he stressed the need for any such Secretariat to win the confidence
and co-operation of the government departments, specifying the ' ex-
treme care which must be exercised to prevent Permanent Under-
secretaries of the various departments from thinking that the Secretariat
were unduly influencing the Prime Minister or other ministers.'^221 But
Bickersteth remained unconvinced about the speech writing role, un-
swayed by Jones' lame assertion that someone had to write speeches for a
modern-day premier. For his part, the Canadian academic decided
against assuming ' a post new in Canada... which might be described as
Executive-Assistant to the Prime Minister.'^222 In declining the post,
Bickersteth confessed his personal preference for the British model,
which he thought superior to what the Canadian premier had in mind.^223
Owing to his reaction, Mackenzie King's project lapsed at this time, but
in 1939, under King's aegis, a body was established much closer to the
British model in its conception. Reviewing his correspondence with
Bickersteth at a later date, Jones noted in the margin: ' It was the war
which made this Dossible in the same way as theyzm war made possible in
England the first Cabinet secretariat.'^224
Since the reform of 1922, the Cabinet Office had remained a small,
tightly knit body under Hankey's direct supervision. To save on staff, he
had introduced a procedure of co-opting departmental officials for the


###### 162 A man and an institution

###### work of Cabinet committees, a practice initially used for serving the

###### Committee of Imperial Defence. Many Cabinet committees had joint

###### secretaries, one from the Cabinet Office and the other from the

###### department most closely concerned with the committee's charge. Econ-

###### omies were effected, but, as important, departmental suspicion of the

###### work carried on at Whitehall Gardens was alleviated: ideally, the Cabinet

###### Secretariat provided for the co-ordination of the committee's work, and

###### the departmental representative supplied the technical expertise.

(^225) In

##### terms of staff, the reforms of 1922 had bitten deeply, since the

###### complement of the Cabinet and CID Secretariats numbered 44 in 1925,

###### by comparison to some 123 only three years earlier.^226 Yet in the process,

###### the departments had been made responsible for preparing the requisite

###### number of copies of memoranda for Cabinet committees, and the Cabinet

###### Office had resumed the printing of documents with large circulations -

###### the Cabinet Minutes did not fall into this category. Frequently, Hankey

###### looked elsewhere for support: ' On the occasion of a big international

###### Conference or an Imperial Conference we sometimes expand into quite a

###### large Department, with reinforcements from other Departments.'^227

###### In organizational terms, the work of the Cabinet Office at this time was

###### divided into three distinct operations: Hankey of course headed the

###### Committee of Imperial Defence, where he was aided by four Assistant

###### Secretaries, seconded from the Admiralty, War Office, Air Ministry and

###### the India Office. A second responsibility involved the work of Cabinet

###### committees, some few permanent but most transient, responding in an ad

###### hoc fashion to perceived problems; in 1925 two Assistant Secretaries

###### were assigned. Serving the secretarial needs of these two operations were

###### nine stenographers, twelve clerks and nine messengers, directed by an

###### Establishment Officer. The third function was self-contained, namely the

###### maintenance of Cabinet records: either Hankey or Jones alone attended

###### Cabinet meetings, and the minutes were prepared by one confidential

###### short-hand writer and another typist; Hankey's personal secretary was

###### also included in the staff of the Private Office.^228 Nor was there any

###### significant growth in staff during the ensuing Baldwin regime.^229 There

###### were two advantages in such a small-scale operation: within the Private

###### Office the value of tight control in stemming non-ministerial leakages is

###### obvious; and generally the numbers at Hankey's disposal were not such as

###### to suggest involvement in policy formulation. The Cabinet Secretary

###### constantly underscored the latter point: ' The function of the Cabinet

###### Office is essentially one of machinery of Government and not of policy. It

###### cannot be too strongly emphasized that the Cabinet Secretary has no duty

###### of offering advice in any matter of policy or of interfering in any way with

###### the functions of responsible Departments in this respect.'^230

###### A novel, and fourth, responsibility was assigned to the Cabinet


```

```
Secretariat in June 1925, under the supervision of the Deputy Secretary,
Tom Jones. Initially called the Committee of Civil Research, the
operation was patterned closely on that of the CID, designed to function
neither as a conventional Cabinet committee nor as a department:
It is not the first because it can do nothing but investigate and recommend; it is
not the second because it has no fixed numbers or rigid procedures. No executive
officer is under its authority. No department is in obedience. No man sits on it as
of right except the Prime Minister and those who attend on his invitation.^231
Its charge was simply stated yet wide-ranging, namely c giving connected
forethought from a central standpoint to the development of economic,
scientific and statistical research in relation to civil policy and administ-
ration and it will define new areas in which enquiry will be valuable.'^232
This acceptance of such a responsibility by government had been
foreshadowed in the Machinery of Government Report of 1918, for which
Haldane was in the main responsible; thus it was no coincidence that the
project was revived during the Labour regime, when MacDonald's
Cabinet established a Committee of Economic Enquiry, to ensure that
'national problems were actually... being faced and thought out in
advance on a basis of fact.'^233 Yet the short life of the government and the
disposition of the premier meant that Haldane's ideas were not put to the
test; MacDonald took no action to make a reality of what the Cabinet and
the Treasury had endorsed.^234 With Baldwin's succession, the initiative
for the development of a research organization passed into the hands of
A. J. Balfour; not only was the former premier well acquainted with the
elastic nature of the CID, but he also was a patron of science and a pioneer
in the co-ordination of governmental scientific research. Under his
leadership, the Committee of Civil Research strove to combat the harsh
realities of Britain's post-war economic problems: 'Industrial research
ought not to be regarded as a desirable luxury like good motor roads,' he
commented to Hankey; 'can we afford not to spend the sums on research
which the general economic policy of the government and our national
position among world producers seem to require?'^235
Between 1925 and 1929, the main Committee met twenty-six times,
investigating a dozen topics, including such major concerns as the Iron
and Steel Industry, Overseas Loans, Electrical Development and Un-
employment in the Coal Industry; either the Prime Minister or Lord
Balfour chaired these meetings, and a half-dozen ministers attended with
some regularity, although invitations varied with the scope of each
inquiry. In addition, some eighteen sub-committees were established to
investigate technical matters, ranging from the Tsetse Fly to Radium
Supplies; the membership of these bodies usually consisted of dis-
tinguished authorities unconnected with the government, and such
'experts' were on occasion co-opted by the main committee.^236 Despite


###### 164 A man and an institution

###### such activity, the CCR's Secretary, Jones, regarded the analogy to the

###### CID as' apt to mislead,' and he recognized that it failed to realize the high

###### hopes of its founders in its first years of existence. A re-organization in

###### 1930 pointed very clearly to deficiencies in the relationship of the CCR to

###### the executive departments.^237 Yet its existence, within the Cabinet Office,

###### incorporated a measure of'constitutional innovation': 'Conceptually, it

###### was the first attempt to create, along the lines suggested by Haldane and

###### Balfour, a "research department" at the highest level, able to recruit

###### economic and scientific specialists to tackle problems outside the

###### jurisdiction of particular government departments.'^238 Admittedly, there

###### developed a considerable gap between the concept and the practice,

###### which another Labour regime attempted to narrow in 1929.

###### Hankey's own hand did not loom large in the work of the Committee of

###### Civil Research, and his biographer's assertion of his 'great interest' in its

###### labors must be viewed as an uncharacteristic exaggeration.^239 Surely he

###### regarded the use of the CID analogy as a compliment, and he expressed

###### the hope that the CCR would be useful in strengthening imperial

###### bonds.^240 We do not know if Hankey relished the lodging of such an

###### operation - minute though its scale - within the Cabinet Office, which

###### contradicted the Tory demands to restrict the scope of his operations

###### voiced only several years earlier. His operation continued to discharge a

###### number of responsibilities in the co-ordination of Cabinet government.

###### While the Treasury remained the central department of government, the

###### Cabinet Secretariat had maintained its function as the primary agent of

###### the Cabinet.


## Twin institutions

###### During the second Baldwin administration, Hankey remained a leading

###### military adviser, whose counsel was nearly always sought albeit not in all

###### cases heeded. Nor did Hankey shy from obtruding that advice where he

###### thought the national interest at stake. Generally he maneuvered with his

###### fabled tact, as we shall see in our conspectus of Hankey's activities:

###### Hankey had himself become an institution, above and beyond the

###### Cabinet Secretariat. As his contemporaries could not separate the twin

###### institutions, some account of his personal involvement is needed to

###### supplement consideration of his secretarial labors. While Hankey as

###### Cabinet Secretary influenced ministers who were now, by and large, far

###### less experienced in affairs of state than he, his own institutional strength

###### derived from his position as Secretary to the Committee of Imperial

###### Defence, which co-ordinated the defence arrangements of the United

###### Kingdom and the British Empire. We need recall Hankey's own

###### assertion, dating to 1927:' I do in fact give more time to the affairs of the

###### C.I.D. than to the Cabinet,' an allocation of time and effort which he

###### preferred.^1 Hankey's involvement with the CID stemmed at least in part

###### from the lessened scale of Cabinet activity in Baldwin's regime; since

###### Hankey continued to take Cabinet Minutes unless otherwise occupied, he

###### had more time for other concerns than had been the case during the Lloyd

###### George coalition.^2 Yet the major reason for his priority remained his

###### interest in military and defence questions; whether as mediator or, on

###### occasion, as an activist, Hankey strove to prevent any relative weakening

###### of Britain's overall military posture and strength.

###### Of course, Hankey's fears that a Labour government would undermine

###### the CID's work had not been realized: from the first, MacDonald had

###### assured the committee that 'there would be no break in the harmony

###### which had previously existed.' He observed that differences of opinion

###### concerning details of expenditure might arise, but more ominously, the

###### Labour leader suggested that 'public opinion was as important as

###### 165


```
166 A man and an institution
```
military considerations in formulating sound strategical plans.'^3 Granted
that the force of' public opinion' may have represented novel input for
the military leaders; nonetheless, its impact might well be blunted by the
assuring presence of Haldane presiding over the CID in the Prime
Minister's absence. For his part, Hankey quickly acquainted the new
members of the CID, which remained the Prime Minister's own, with the
work carried out by its standing sub-committees, and he addressed the
problems which the CID had to confront.^4
The Admiralty first felt the force of' public opinion' when the Labour
government refused to carry on construction of the Singapore naval base.
The Colonial Secretary, J. H. Thomas, acknowledged a 'most admirable
case' made from a strategic perspective, but the Cabinet gave priority to
the concern for 'international co-operation,' hoping that Britain's
evident restraint would contribute to ' the creation of conditions which
will make a comprehensive agreement in limitation of armaments
possible.'^5 As an advisory body, the CID could do no more than review
the broad implications for British naval dispositions east of Suez posed by
Labour's commitment to test the waters of disarmament.
In the course of announcing to the House of Commons the Singapore
decision, MacDonald appeared to call into question the role of the CID in
co-ordinating defence policy; he inferred that the committee was too
narrowly based to reflect a balanced view of British interests:

```
I put in a plea for a wider co-operation of national policy with national defence
schemes... Sooner or later this country will have to devise some means by which
that co-ordination is to affect our defensive military manoeuvres. So far as
Singapore is concerned I say that we have created a Defence Committee with the
Prime Minister as Chairman [i.e., the CID]. That is an excellent idea, and an
excellent machine if it could work. But it cannot work! It shows certain
weaknesses... the extension of Singapore is one of the most magnificent test
cases demanding that wider co-operation of any that has happened in our
lifetime.^6
```
```
Hankey immediately protested what he regarded as aspersions upon the
CID: 'There may or may not be weaknesses in our present system of co-
ordination, but I submit that Singapore is about the worst case that can be
taken to illustrate them ... no question has been more exhaustively
studied in the last twenty years.' The CID Secretary maintained that the
Singapore base had been abandoned because of Labour's 'foreign
policy'; such a rationale, he insisted, did not invalidate decisions taken
by previous governments, nor did it point to faulty co-ordination. His
passion was such that he had recourse to a tactic which had worked to the
Cabinet Secretariat's advantage two years earlier, suggesting an enquiry,
'if only in justice to those who have been trying, as they thought with
success, to make it work.' MacDonald eschewed any such investigation,
```

###### Twin institutions 167

###### nor did he avail himself of Hankey's offer to review the CID records

###### himself; instead, he commented lamely that 'the weakness is in the P.M.

###### himself and that is what I had in mind ... I shall have a talk with you one

###### day soon. Meanwhile leave it where it is.'^7 The exchange was private, but

###### Hankey had vindicated the committee as the agency for the co-ordination

###### of defence.

###### Admiralty anger with the Singapore reversal was somewhat assuaged

###### by the Cabinet's decision to proceed with the construction of five large

###### cruisers, although that decision owed more to Labour's preoccupation

###### with relieving high unemployment in ship-building centers. Hankey

###### accommodated himself to these Labour initiatives - his sympathies lay

###### with the Admiralty throughout - and his influence was not forceful, save

###### in defending the CID. Almost certainly Hankey had decided not to press

###### his new masters, but in general he preferred what his biographer has

###### rightly called 'the method of indirect approach' to attain his ends.^8

###### Indirection requires time, and Hankey was inclined to patience: time was,

###### after all, on his side. With the return of the Conservatives to office,

###### Hankey's need to defend the CID lapsed, and he found Curzon,

###### Haldane's replacement, 'extraordinarily prompt in dealing with busi-

###### ness,'^9 no small virtue in his book. As encouraging was the interest which

###### Stanley Baldwin showed in the CID and in defence problems, as Hankey

###### recorded in March 1926: 'he is taking as great a personal interest in the

###### Committee as any Chief I have ever had... since he has been in office, he

###### has, I think, missed only one Meeting. In addition to this, he sees me

###### every day.'^10 In this coupling of an official role and a personal presence,

###### Hankey exercised an influence over ministers which reminds one of

###### Bagehot's description of the rights of a constitutional monarch, namely to

###### be consulted, to encourage, and to warn.^11 No monarch he, but Hankey

###### followed the institutional route to influence, and his centrality in defence

###### matters was the result.

###### In the mid-2os, Sir Maurice not only recorded the proceedings of the

###### COS Committee of the CID, but he also mediated the tension-laden

###### meetings of that body, in which the three service heads maintained an

###### intense rivalry. Nonetheless, they were charged with giving collective

###### advice, and Hankey exercised his conciliatory talents in helping to forge

###### some twenty 'joint appreciations'; by no means did he reconcile the

###### senior services to the extravagant claims of the RAF concerning its role in

###### any future war,^12 but relations among the services would likely have been

###### noticeably worse had it not been for his efforts.^13 Hankey's mediative

###### skills were also fully extended by the willingness of the Conservative

###### regime to delegate to the CID the taxing question of' the rate at which the

###### Singapore base should be proceeded with,' since they had agreed on

###### renewed construction. A sub-committee was appointed, ultimately under


###### 168 A man and an institution

###### Baldwin's lead, with Hankey as secretary: the services disagreed about

###### the type of fortifications desirable for the base and Hankey dealt with the

###### conflicting claims advanced by the Admiralty, the Air Staff, and a

```
Chancellor intent upon economies, Winston Churchill. Hankey's efforts
to achieve a compromise foundered on the prejudices of the rival services:
```
###### with the Treasury's opposition added to the balance, the Admiralty had

###### to settle for substantial reductions in expenditures.^14 Influence, in short,

###### did not always produce the desired results; Singapore is a case in point.

Naval expenditures proved another contentious topic, because

###### Churchill was anxious to curb excessive expenditures, assuming, as he

###### did, that there was no serious prospect of war with Japan within his life-

###### time. In this matter Hankey engaged in an exchange of divergent views

```
with his deputy, Tom Jones, revealing the gap which had opened between
the two. The Cabinet Secretary advanced an economic rationale for arma-
ments expenditure, which in the past had constituted ' a gigantic subsidy'
```
###### which met the overhead expenses not only of the armaments firms but

###### also of a vast network of suppliers. Cuts in defence spending undercut

###### this subsidy, and, in Hankey's view, 'the consequence is that in all the

###### centres of our vast shipbuilding industry and of the other connected

###### industries, thousands of men are walking the streets and half-starving on

###### the deadly demoralizing dole.'^15 In a memorandum sent to the Prime

Minister, Jones bluntly disagreed with Hankey's thesis: 'Disarmament is

###### not a root cause of unemployment. It is a contributory cause in particular

###### centres and temporary circumstances.' Nor were there simple solutions

###### to the problem of unemployment:

###### There is only alleviation. The real issue is: Which is the less harmful way of

###### alleviating - building battleships which by hypothesis are not wanted and would

rapidly disappear or increasing our permanent productive assets by constructive

###### measures of alleviation. We can spend the money either way but which would

###### have the more beneficent reaction is obvious.

###### What was obvious to one was contested by the other: 'Expenditure on

###### Defence is better than Doles ... which rot the morale of the people and

promote the interest of the shirker.'^16 Strong disagreements these, as two

###### nominal civil servants contested for influence upon the Prime Minister:

###### in the era of Hankey and Jones, the Cabinet Secretariat was not a

bloodless bureaucratic institution.

###### Through these years, the CID had re-emerged from wartime eclipse,

###### once again to play a dominant role in defence: the Labour party in

###### opposition expressed concern that it constituted a hindrance to the

###### exercise of democratic government.^17 MacDonald had direct experience

###### of its operation, but he nonetheless queried Hankey concerning the

###### subordination of the CID to the Cabinet. Hankey reminded the former

###### premier that the CID shunned the word 'decision,' since its 'conclu-


###### Twin institutions 169

###### sions' or 'recommendations' would 'always be brought to the Cabinet.'

###### Admittedly the CID might resolve technical matters, but with regard to

###### policy the Committee remained a consultative body; in fact what Hankey

###### referred to as ' the improved organization for the transaction of Cabinet

###### business' ensured that recommendations concerning policy had to come

###### before the Cabinet. Although MacDonald accepted the description

###### forthwith, Hankey took further pains to compile a lengthy memorandum,

###### based upon the experiences of the late Labour government, demonstrat-

###### ing that 'the strength or weakness of the CID at any moment is entirely

###### under the control of the Prime Minister and the Cabinet.'^18 Characteristi-

###### cally, Hankey asked only that his own name be kept out of whatever use

###### MacDonald might choose to make of the document; again we see him

###### moving behind the scenes, following the ' indirect approach,' in order to

###### defend the defence organization with which he above all others was

###### directly identified.

###### The point of departure for Hankey's exercise of influence in defence

###### policy lay in his functional responsibilities as Secretary of the CID: on

###### any such issue, Hankey could establish a preliminary direction of inquiry,

###### through his circulation of relevant materials from two decades of the

###### committee's deliberations. While memoranda could be drawn up anew,

###### often they were simply updated for the occasion; in either case the

###### conservative basis of materials reflecting above all else experience

###### remained intact. In councils of defence, whatever the forum, Hankey

###### could bring his vast experience and sets of records quickly to bear upon

###### the discussion. His ' expert' status was denied by no one; however, where

###### defence concerns intersected with foreign policy, Hankey had to move

###### more warily, because military considerations were but one source which

###### the Cabinet had to take into account. Not only might suspicions based

###### upon past criticisms of the role of the Cabinet Secretariat resurface, but

###### also party ideology could be placed above the most thoroughly researched

###### defence inquiry: Singapore underscores the point.

###### Given these limitations, what attitudes did Hankey show towards issues

###### of foreign policy in the post-war era? How did he bring his influence to

###### bear in matters where he was not conceded 'expert' status? It is

###### instructive to compare his reaction to the proposed Geneva Protocol with

###### his subsequent posture towards the Locarno pacts. In the former he

###### played a role, precisely because he was able to establish a functional

###### responsibility, which he discharged with conviction and vigor. The

###### Labour government had wrestled with but had failed to resolve the

###### question of Britain's adherence to the Geneva Protocol, and so it was left

###### to Baldwin's Cabinet to settle; from within, Lord Cecil pressed, with the

###### conviction of the true believer, to secure British assent. To do otherwise,


###### 170 A man and an institution

###### he argued, would undermine British obligations under the Covenant of

###### the League of Nations; in particular, the continental nations looked to

###### Article 16, which stipulated automatic sanctions, as the 'sheet anchor^5 of

###### peace. Hankey dissented from British acceptance of such 'impracticable'

###### commitments, which history - and the American refusal to join the

###### League - had outpaced: 'My own fear is, and always has been, that the

###### League may become discredited by these repeated efforts to achieve the

###### impossible, and that the priceless work it is doing in the direction of

###### peaceful settlement of disputes and the creation of a better feeling in

###### nations may for this reason be hampered.'^19 Cecil was not deflected from

his advocacy of the Protocol, although he must have been disheartened by

###### his exclusion from a CID sub-committee - chaired by Sir Maurice

###### Hankey - appointed in December 1924 to consider amending the

###### Protocol. In its deliberations, Hankey minced no words with fellow

###### leading civil servants who comprised the sub-committee: automatic

###### sanctions carried with them nothing less than the ' surrender of the rights

of national sovereignty.'^20

###### Yet in this instance the CID Secretary did not carry his colleagues to

###### the point where he could sign the sub-committee's report; however, the

###### Baldwin government took the position which Hankey had advocated in

###### rejecting British participation in the Geneva Protocol. They had then to

deal with the unresolved problem of European security. Talk of a security

###### pact among Britain, France, Germany, and Belgium persisted with the

###### Foreign Office, but Hankey lobbied the contrary case with the former

###### Foreign Secretary, Lord Curzon, as well as with Lord Balfour and

###### Stanley Baldwin: ' I pointed out that the average Englishman... would

###### never consent to guarantee the German frontier against France, because

###### this could never be really a British interest.'^21 He believed that there was

###### no substantive reason - save the need to remain on cordial terms with the

###### French - to support a four power pact.^22 Curzon's death removed his

###### principal ally from the scene, but Hankey approached the Foreign

###### Secretary, Austen Chamberlain, who had in the interim convinced the

###### Cabinet to negotiate such a pact. In this case, Hankey's post as Cabinet

Secretary secured him access to Chamberlain, whom he asked to approve

###### minutes of a Cabinet meeting at which the latter had presided, and he

proceeded

to point out that the question had not been considered from the point of view of

###### [military] commitments... Some day the cheque might be presented, and we

###### should have to honour it. Had he considered the desirability of having the

```
question of the commitments involved in his policy considered by the [Fighting
Service] staffs and the CID?
The tactic is familiar: Hankey hoped to re-open the question of a security
```
###### pact within a military context. Chamberlain, however, did not take the

bait:


```
Twin institutions 171
```
He thought that by this quadruple pact he might secure a permanent peace, and
get rid of the war spirit which is so rife in Europe. If he failed he thought that
Europe would inevitably drift in time into another war. He did not wish to wreck
his policy on the technicalities of military considerations. Military men were
bound to look at the question from rather a narrow point of view - and so forth.

Hankey had to settle for Chamberlain's willingness to enlist the 'good
will' of the COS in this course, but such an outright dismissal of 'the
technicalities of military considerations' troubled Hankey, and he
confided to his diary:' I am unhappy about this Four Power Pact. It is not
as bad as the Geneva Protocol, but it will be unpopular... But I have
done as much as I ought, and shall now leave them to work it out.'^23 In this
episode, Hankey had recognized the limits to his influence and steered
within them: where the issue was not a military one, he could proceed no
further than his influence would take him. As far as the four power pact
was concerned, Chamberlain was not prepared to be diverted; he had
embarked on the diplomatic path which led to Locarno.
Since Hankey could welcome the absence of compulsory military
sanctions in the Locarno pacts, he came to support those arrangements.^24
As well, he commended Chamberlain's efforts in a way which came
readily to him: ' I have been something more than a spectator of all the
efforts made since the war to bring about a durable peace, and I know that
very soon after you took office you drew your course on the chart and that
you have pursued it unerringly to your destination.'^25 Doubtless the
compliment was an honest one, but Hankey, at the same time, cultivated
future influence where he had been unable on this occasion to exercise it.
The era of Locarno produced insistent demands for substantial
reductions in British armaments, but in no quarter more strongly than
Lord Cecil's. Hankey kept a measured distance from Cecil, even in the
latter's service as chairman of a CID Sub-Committee dealing with
disarmament.^26 In 1927 Cecil came into sharp disagreement both with the
Admiralty and a number of his Cabinet colleagues, in a dispute whether
Britain had accepted the principle of parity in the cruiser category at the
Washington Naval Conference in 1922.^27 When the successor Geneva
Conference broke up in August 1927, Cecil resigned, owing to his belief
that the Cabinet was opposed to additional measures of naval disarma-
ment. Frustrated in his attempt to force the issue by a letter addressing
the Cabinet discussions, Cecil chose the occasion of Parliament's
reassembly to speak his mind; his revelations far exceeded the bounds
within which Hankey had attempted to maintain the secrecy of Cabinet
deliberations. As a result, the Cabinet Secretary prepared a lengthy
memorandum which cited the various distortions, misleading state-
ments, and inaccuracies which Cecil had, in his view, inflicted upon the
House of Lords; it is difficult to determine whether the disclosures or the
inaccuracies disturbed Hankey more, but Baldwin took no further

```
action.^28 Hankey's several exchanges with Cecil serve to strengthen an
understanding of Hankey's own beliefs, which amounted to a philosophy
of what could be called 'military necessity'; for instance, he wrote to the
dedicated pacifist in August 1925:
I confess that I cannot go all the way with your view that war is necessarily evil in
itself... War is one of the forces by which the powers of evil have been
combatted. But my earlier paper was not written as an opposition to peace, as you
suggest. I tried to show that, whatever you do, war will come sooner or later, and,
if you carry disagreement too far and crush the military spirit, your civilization
will go under... My argument, then, is not for war, but for caution, lest we bring
down civilization with a crash.^29
In truth, Hankey was no opponent of peace, but even in the Locarno
years, the menace of war confronting an unprepared Britain was ever
present in his mind.
Throughout the period, Hankey remained a firm opponent of any idea
involving the creation of a ministry of defence: CID files swelled with
accumulated arguments against even such a variation as an amalgamation
of the supply services of the forces. He contended that the COS
Committee of the CID determined priorities which would facilitate the
Treasury design to impose a maximum figure for all defence spending,
writing to Churchill: 'For modern war we have to organize the whole
resources of the nation. At the CID this has been done to a considerable
extent, and the process is going on without involving any special
expenditure.'^30 In 1928 Hankey had to defend the extant defence
organization from the views of his former chief, Lloyd George, who
suggested that a single minister could impose 'a much more cost-effective
system.'^31 Fearing for the independence of the CID with a defence
minister in place, Hankey couched his impressions of Lloyd George's
scheme in terms that it appears were designed to catch Baldwin's eye,
advising him that the proposal was not necessarily 'impossible or
unworkable... but it rather assumes the "super-man" - a dangerous
assumption.'^32 Since the Prime Minister did not look with any favor upon
that rara avis, Hankey blunted the force of Lloyd George's criticism and
held the fort for the CID, very nearly to the end of the Baldwin era.
Secure in the military sphere, Hankey maintained throughout the
decade a successful defensive perimeter in an issue with foreign policy
repercussions, namely the projected construction of a Channel Tunnel:
he wanted no part of any scheme which would directly threaten Britain
with a continental incursion. Defence considerations in fact carried the
day when Prime Minister MacDonald and an all-party committee
supported by some four hundred MPs favored its construction.^33 On one
extraordinary occasion in July 1924, four former premiers - Balfour,
Asquith, Lloyd George, and Baldwin - met with the CID in order to


Twin institutions 173

remove the issue from the realm of partisan politics. Military opinion,
past and present, ran heavily against a continental connection, to which
Hankey appended his own conclusion:' there appears no room for doubt
that the existence of a Tunnel would be bound to add something to the
anxieties of those responsible for national defence, to our commitments,
and to our expenditure.'^34 MacDonald reluctantly accepted the unanim-
ous view of the CID, although he thought that the' military mind... has
got itself and the country as well in a rut where neither fresh air nor new
ideas blow.'^35 Hankey remained ever vigilant against a revival of the hoary
proposal, exulting in 1930 that the 'weak and sickly' project had been
' killed,'^36 as it had - at least for his lifetime.
On another matter Hankey felt so strongly that he would not entertain
compromise, despite the fact that what its partisans called ' Freedom of
the Seas' involved much more than what Chamberlain had dismissed as
'the technicalities of military considerations.' Hankey's aversion to any
compromise of Britain's long-standing claim to 'Belligerent Rights'
stemmed from pre-war CID doctrine that, in the event of war with
Germany,' the utmost possible economic pressure' should be brought to
bear. When in February 1915 Col E. M. House raised the question of
'Freedom of the Seas,' Hankey minuted Asquith 'not to take any action
which would fetter our use of the weapon of starving Germany unless
overwhelming advantages are to be gained thereby.'^37 His feelings did not
abate with the years, as a torrent of memoranda written in 1927-8, when
the matter was re-opened, indicate: the Cabinet Secretary strove to
counter the contention that Britain ought to improve her relations with
the United States through the surrender of portions of her claim to
'Belligerent Rights.' When Austen Chamberlain appeared to be so
inclined, Hankey - ill and absent from London - mounted one of his
'campaigns':^38 not only did he write Chamberlain, but he also urged his
deputy, Tom Jones, to intercede directly with the Prime Minister in
order to impress upon him that:

```
(1) Austen's paper ought not to be taken by the Cabinet until the Admiralty have
been given time to prepare something.
(2) If the Cabinet decide upon an inquiry it should be a CID inquiry, as the
matter is vital to Imperial Defence.
(3) My experience in this matter is so unique that I ought to be a member of the
CID inquiry.
I decided years ago that if ever 'Freedom of the Seas' went through I should
resign, as Imperial Defence would then become a sham.^39
Remanding the question to the CID was the usual tactic, but the depth of
Hankey's commitment quite exceeds that of the other causes which he
served;^40 he found it ironic that this sad state of affairs should come about
with the 'patriotic' party in power.
```

174 A man and an institution

Tom Jones immediately called Hankey's views to Baldwin's attention,
although in a fashion which the Cabinet Secretary likely did not
anticipate:

Saw the P.M. alone. I gave him Hankey's letter on blockade to read, remarking
that it seemed to me a wrong conception of a Civil Servant's function to threaten
resignation on policy and that in any case there was no immediate danger of a
change of policy by the Cabinet. The P.M. agreed to the latter remark, and added,
'After all, the Cabinet must discuss issues of this kind.'^41

Since Hankey had not specified that his letter should be shown to
Baldwin, in one sense he was not threatening resignation; on the other
hand, he would expect Jones to convey the strength of his convictions to
Baldwin. Thus Roskill's judgment that the incident 'was not exactly a
display of loyalty by Hankey's deputy'^42 impresses as harsh: it was not
exactly a display of disloyalty, either. Nonetheless, Jones' comment that
Hankey held a 'wrong conception' of the civil servant's role seems
gratuitous7T)ecause no one knew better than he that such frank
confidences were the rule, not the exception, in the exchanges between
premien^andleading Secretariat personnel. After all, Baldwin apparently
registered no surprise - let alone outrage - that Hankey had written in
such terms. Nor was such passion novel among the major government
advisers of the inter-war period, whatever glossy fictions may be
advanced concerning the neutrality of civil servants: Hankey's advocacy
of 'Belligerent Rights' remains a particularly telling example.^43
Nor did Hankey make any effort to mask what he described as his' bias'
from those who knew him well.^44 Though he was not appointed a member
of the Belligerent Rights Sub-Committee of the CID, chaired by
Salisbury, Hankey was given status as an 'expert assessor,' with the
Prime Minister's authority ' to depart from the usual rule of not offering
comment on matters before the Cabinet.'^45 Although this body continued
its discussions for the balance of the Baldwin regime, at no time did it
forward recommendations to the CID or the Cabinet. Hankey's position
throughout was to maintain in an absolute fashion Britain's claim to
' Belligerent Rights,' avoiding any discussion of the matter which in itself
posed a danger: 'the nations of the world,' he wrote, 'would be well
advised at the present time to leave alone the international study of war
and its rules (which are apt to prove a cause of friction and irritation) and
to devote their energies to the promotion of peace, security and
disarmament, which when accomplished, will render war and its rules a
thing of the past.'^46 In this advice, Hankey conveniently suspended his
own belief that nothing could render war an anachronism: if during peace
there was no discussion of the' rules' of war, Britain would be free in time
of war to impose a blockade of her enemies.
Discussions of Britain's naval role served as well to focus Hankey's


```
Twin institutions 175
```
thoughts concerning relations with the United States, another matter in
which he and Tom Jones differed. In October 1928 Hankey wrote
caustically that a recent' offensive and provocative' communication from
Washington had accepted the notion of' special needs' for the French and
Italian navies, while ignoring altogether those of the British Empire. In
replying to his chief, who was abroad at the time, Jones disclaimed any
expertise in naval matters but contended that the British position was
difficult to comprehend; Hankey's own views he thought in effect ignored
America:' It is idle to pretend that America isn't there, or is not ten times
richer than we are, and that in a struggle the behaviour of the Dominions
would at least be doubtful. But this will seem awful tosh to you so I'll
switch off.' And 'tosh' it proved to Hankey, who revealed in his reply a
deepening animus towards America:

We have been practising your policy for 10 years, and it has been a dead failure.
We have played up to America over the Covenant of the League, abandonment of
the Japanese Alliance, Washington Treaties, debt settlement, Irish settlement,
liquor treaty (limit of territorial waters); always making concessions and always
being told that the next step would change their attitude. Yet they are, as the
result, more overbearing and suspicious against us than anyone else.
I am, of course, not for an aggressive attitude. But I would make no more
concessions to the Americans, and I am convinced we cannot' square yardarms'
over the naval agreement... You can't do business with them.

Hankey reminded Jones that Britain had unique naval responsibilities:
' Our communications, vital to our existence, run through the deep seas
and the narrow seas. We must be able to defend either. Global tonnage
parity is therefore impossible to us.'^47 The 'special needs' of the British
Empire, in sum, dictated for Hankey a superior Fleet.
Hankey's comments, to be sure, came at the nadir of Anglo-American
naval relations in the inter-war years, and his dislike of American conduct
must be viewed in that context. On the other hand, the tides of history
were running against Hankey's vision of the world order, and he shared
the strategic astigmatism which Tom Jones detected in the Foreign
Office: 'The F.O. is still dominated by the 19th Century tradition of
dealing with Europe through France and forgetting the existence of the
U.S.A.'^48 Hankey had not forgotten the United States, but he gave the
impression of not forgiving America its emergence as a world power.
The question of naval relations remained an open one when, in June
1929, Ramsay MacDonald again exchanged places with Stanley Baldwin;
the Labour leader lost little time in agreeing to preliminary conversations
in Washington. Since informality was to mark the discussions, Hankey
was left behind because, he explained to his son, he was considered too
much 'the pundit' in defence matters.^49 Alas, Hankey's suspicions about
the Americans were reinforced by the events across the Atlantic:


###### 176 A man and an institution

```
First, MacDonald is told in June that the question ' Belligerent Rights' is off.
Then he comes to Washington and gets a tremendous reception. When drunk
with success he is brought to the lumber camp [of President Hoover], and without
any experts to consult with - for there was an understanding that he should take
no experts to Washington - the question is sprung on him in a most acute and
contentious form.^50
```
###### Hoover had proposed the issuance of a communique, announcing

###### ' conversations to be begun on Belligerent Rights... and... the hope

###### that foodstuffs would ... be excluded from the scope of blockade,

###### foodships being treated like hospital ships.' In London there was

###### consternation with this turn of events: the Chancellor of the Exchequer,

###### Philip Snowden, was 'intensely irritated.' For his part, Hankey resorted

##### to a familiar tactic: he rallied the Chiefs of Staff, conferred as well with

###### Snowden and the other leading ministers in London, and personally

###### warned MacDonald that danger flags were flying as a result of what he

###### characterized as 'in 21 years at the C.I.D.... the most controversial

###### subject of all:.. .a storm would arise if the food paragraph appeared;...

###### the national support he was receiving would disappear and be replaced

###### with a sharp controversy.'^51

###### In receipt of what Hankey thought' a pretty hot telegram,' MacDonald

###### denied that he had agreed to the exclusion of foodstuffs from the act of

###### blockade; whatever the reality, his confreres had advised that no mention

###### of blockade be made, less 'tacit acquiescence' be attributed to

###### MacDonald's role in the discussions. When the much-feared com-

###### munique was issued on 10 October, those paragraphs which had

###### provoked London were nowhere to be seen: Hankey even checked the

###### contents of the communique as it appeared in The Times, and its absence

###### there as well produced a state of euphoria in the dyspeptic Snowden, who

###### according to Hankey was 'astonished at his own success in getting the

###### objectionable paragraphs deleted.'^52 To consolidate the position, Hankey

###### subsequently sought to convince MacDonald that the topic of 'Belli-

###### gerent Rights' ought not to be raised at the forthcoming London naval

###### conference, in view of the contretemps at Washington.

###### To this point Hankey's actions fell within his adviser's role, but so

###### deeply did he feel about the matter that he took a nearly unprecedented

###### step, in order to complete the rout of the American position: he agreed to

###### an interview with a newsman from The Times, sent to him by the editor

#### ' to ask my views, which, for the first time to a newspaperman, I gave. As a

###### matter of fact he was quite sound on the subject and the Times leader was

###### admirable.'^53 The Cabinet Secretary had every reason to be pleased with

###### The Times' contribution to the cause, since the journal wrote in an

###### optimistic vein about the likely success of the London conference,

###### precisely because Hoover and MacDonald had created a favorable


###### Twin institutions 177

###### atmosphere in their discussions. One conclusion in particular represents

###### vintage Hankey: 'No one can discuss belligerent rights unless he is in

###### imagination already at war, and therefore too easily a prey to the old ideas

###### and the old temper.'^54

###### So vital did Hankey judge Britain's right to blockade that he violated a

###### self-imposed rule of the office, namely that the Cabinet Secretary 'never

###### communicates with the press in any shape or form.'^55 Hankey clearly

###### knew what he was doing, because his identity was masked in the leader.

###### At the same time, Hankey abandoned the 'indirect approach' which

###### usually marked his dealings with ministers. In effect, MacDonald

###### remarked upon Hankey's departure from the civil service role in directing

###### a remark his way in the presence of the Cabinet: 'Here is Sir Maurice

###### Hankey,' he commented in apparent good humour,' as long as he remains

###### in office there are two institutions which are quite safe. One is monarchy.

###### The other our Maritime Belligerent Rights.'^56 Seemingly the Prime

###### Minister bore Hankey no animosity for having mustered the forces which

###### brought him to heel: perhaps he thought that a function of advisers.

###### In fact there was a very close connection between the institutions

###### which MacDonald rightly perceived Hankey's determination to uphold,

###### because George V was equally insistent concerning 'Belligerent Rights':

###### the monarch had expressed 'violent' opinions about Hoover's proposal,

###### and he showed great confidence in Hankey's judgment in matters

###### associated with Britain's claim to exercise such rights.^57 Yet the Cabinet

###### Secretary's adherence to a policy - however meritorious his commitment

###### to the maintenance of Britain's naval strength - impresses as essentially

###### ministerial, rather than bureaucratic, in nature. By present-day stan-

###### dards, Hankey exceeded the bounds for civil servants. Yet the point

###### remains that Hankey's activities served in his own time to define what was

###### proper for him as a civil servant, so long as the Prime Minister and the

###### Cabinet accepted such a role for him, or for other servants of the Crown,

###### such as Tom Jones, whose wide-ranging functions were definitely not

###### unique.^58 Neither Baldwin nor MacDonald challenged such activities on

###### the part of leading civil servants: for that reason, Hankey's role must be

###### viewed as constitutionally proper.

###### With a modest electoral swing to the left in 1929, MacDonald once again

###### led a minority government; no questions were raised about the survival

###### either of the Cabinet Secretariat or the Committee of Imperial Defence.

###### With the Prime Minister's approval, Hankey circulated a Memorandum

###### on Cabinet Procedure to the relatively inexperienced Labour ministers,

###### and the Cabinet agreed that the responsibility for effecting Cabinet

###### decisions lay solely with ministers: thus, at each department the minister

###### alone could open the envelope which contained Cabinet Minutes, with


178 A man and an institution

full responsibility for preserving secrecy devolving upon him. Yet such a
practice could not be sustained, as the information required to implement
Cabinet decisions could not be so drastically curtailed: at the second
Cabinet meeting of the new regime, the Prime Minister was given
authority to instruct the permanent head of a department to communicate
to that department a relevant decision.^59 Three weeks later, ministerial
discretion widened: ministers were henceforth free to take the senior
permanent officials and the Principal Private Secretary into full confi-
dence, after ' warning them of the particular importance of secrecy in
regard to Cabinet proceedings.'^60 Clearly more officials had a 'need to
know' than the Labour Cabinet had first recognized. At no point did
Labour attempt to re-introduce the detailed press communique of 1924;
they accepted instead the Baldwin practice of releasing to the press the
names of those who had attended. Almost surely with the events of 1924
in mind, the relationship of the Law Officers to the Cabinet was redefined
by a stipulation that Cabinet proceedings would be reported to the
Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General only through the person of
the Lord Chancellor; they were to be advised prior to the circulation of
memoranda which involved legal matters, as was the case with the
Treasury and new expenditures. The distinction between the legal
functions of the Law Officers and the political concerns of the Cabinet
was ensured by this procedure.
The Cabinet also agreed that the Cabinet Minutes (they were once
again so characterized) were' to avoid any reference to opinions expressed
by any individual and to limit the Minutes as narrowly as possible to the
actual decisions agreed to.'^61 As a result, the Cabinet Minutes for the two
successive MacDonald ministries, through 1935, are tne most austere,
even sparse, for the whole of Hankey's tenure: with the ironic exception
of several periods when Hankey was abroad while the Cabinet met
regularly, Cabinet Minutes of this period lack the flesh of individual
contributions: ministerial titles disappear, and references to conflicting
views are masked by such phrases as ' after considerable discussion.' Only
in the case of ministers who had circulated a Cabinet memorandum is the
notice given that they initiated discussion of the topic.
Hankey's assistants apparently paid less regard than he to these
strictures about identification of individual views: while Tom Jones
remained at the Cabinet Office, he sometimes recorded specific attri-
butions of comments made in Cabinet.^62 Following Jones' retirement in
1930, he was succeeded by Rupert Howorth, Deputy Secretary until
1942, who recorded more comprehensive minutes for the important
Cabinet proceedings of August 1931. Yet Hankey maintained the lean
style until, with Baldwin's succession in 1935, he began again to record
the views of individual ministers. Why the terse style during


###### Twin institutions 179

###### MacDonald's return to Downing Street? That he desired to maintain the

###### 'ridiculous fiction... that Cabinet decisions were invariably unanim-

###### ous'^63 is far from sufficient, in light of the public breach of Cabinet

###### collective responsibility dating to that period.^64 Surely the explanation is

###### that MacDonald's memory ranged back to 1924, when the existence of

###### fuller Cabinet records, supplemented by Jones' draft notes, had from the

###### Prime Minister's perspective contributed directly to the fall of his first

###### government. The point remains: Hankey prepared the minutes in

###### accordance with MacDonald's wishes.

###### Nonetheless, the Cabinet Secretary continued to maintain a separate

###### file of Cabinet Minutes dealing with sensitive matters; those minutes, few

###### in number, are fuller both with regard to the range of discussion and

###### attribution of individual views.^65 At no time was the accuracy of Cabinet

###### Minutes challenged; thus, the complaints with present-day Secretariat

###### practices voiced so strongly by R. H. S. Crossman lack any parallel in

###### Hankey's tenure.^66 Nor in any accounts or documentary collections is

###### there any allegation that Hankey engaged in a practice which Crossman

###### attributes to Sir Burke Trend's operation,' constantly transform [ing] the

###### actual proceedings of Cabinet into the form of the Cabinet minutes (i.e. it

###### substitutes what we should have said if we had done as they wished for

###### what we actually did say).'

(^67) In the years from 1929 to 1935, only one

###### instance of a requested alteration in the wording of a Cabinet Minute has

###### come to light, which very nearly confirms the recollection of Hankey's

###### Secretariat associate, Lawrence Burgis, that 'never once in my ex-

###### perience was a draft decision questioned or not acted upon.'^68 Crossman's

###### observations are those of one contentious observer and will require

###### substantiation, but the integrity of Hankey's operation withstands

###### historical scrutiny.

###### In the memorandum which Hankey circulated to the Labour ministers

###### concerning Cabinet procedures, he went to some lengths to outline the

###### work of the various Standing Committees which had functioned under

###### the predecessor regime. Since MacDonald had played a key role in what

###### had been formally constituted in 1925 as the Committee of Civil

###### Research, Hankey's review of its work, first among Standing Commit-

###### tees, does not appear coincidental. Basically, his treatment of the CCR as

###### analogous in structure and procedures to the Committee of Imperial

###### Defence was valid, because both were advisory bodies with no ad-

###### ministrative or executive functions.^69 However, one senses in Hankey's

###### description an equivocal view of its actual achievements, though some of

###### its sub-committees clearly had made advances within limited areas of

###### scientific inquiry. In co-ordinating diverse scientific projects, Thomas

###### Jones had served ably as the CCR Secretary, but his contemporaries were

###### agreed that the CCR had not evolved in such a way as to encourage those


180 A man and an institution

who hoped to develop a mechanism along the lines of an 'economic
general staff.'^70 Far from functioning as an overseer of the relations
among government, industry and science, the CCR's work remained
fragmented from the first. Indeed, any claim to synoptic planning
emanating from within the Cabinet Secretariat would have been strongly
resisted by the Treasury.^71 That the shortcomings of the CCR were
evident is clear in the comment of the Labour premier in November 1929:
'when we came into office we found absolutely nothing of the least use to
us -no statistics prepared, no experience codified.'^72 As clearly, Hankey's
description of its activities had not hidden the fact that as an agency of co-
ordination, the CCR left everything to be desired.^73
The Cabinet Secretary continued his review of the work of Standing
Committees by noting that during the Baldwin administration the Home
Affairs Committee had assumed a functional responsibility ' to examine,
particularly from the legal point of view, Government Bills and other
important Bills, and to make recommendations to the Cabinet on drafting
the other questions of detail, reserving all major questions of policy for
Cabinet decision.'^74 Hankey's thrust was to establish that the Home
Affairs Committee did not function as an inner Cabinet but rather
provided a technical scrutiny which he judged particularly valuable in
removing by committee discussion ' difficulties... which would other-
wise involve considerable departmental correspondence, loss of time and
Parliamentary embarrassment.' As an aid to the Cabinet, the full minutes
and recommendations of the committee were printed and circulated to all
its members: these items were subsequently placed upon the Cabinet's
Agenda, and each formed the subject for a distinct Cabinet Conclusion.
In 1928 the committee had met thirteen times to discuss between forty
and fifty draft bills, but certain of the new ministers inferred that its
functions had been unduly narrowed to the point where it was deficient in
preparing the Cabinet's business. In December 1929, Beatrice Webb
noted that Arthur Henderson had lamented ' the lack of any organization
of Cabinet business especially with regard to finance. Ministers come,
one by one, with demands for money to successive Cabinet meetings -
There is no kind of survey of their respective demands with a view of
discovering which of the proposals are most important.'^75 Since
'Treasury control' supposedly operated with regard to such expendi-
tures, it is not clear why Henderson expected the Home Affairs
Committee to operate in a policy-making fashion, but economic prob-
lems were to plague the second Labour government to the end of its days.
A product of such dislocation was the standing Unemployment
Committee, first constituted in August 1920 and reappointed by each
successor government; adopting the procedures of the Home Affairs
Committee in circulating full minutes and recommendations, its mem-
bers had been drawn from departments grappling with aspects of the


###### Twin institutions 181

###### problem. The second Baldwin government had approached the problem

###### differently, establishing a number of specialized Cabinet committees, and

###### as a result the Unemployment Committee had not met since the autumn

###### of 1925. To this small number of Standing Committees the Baldwin

###### government had added a Naval Programme Committee to consider such

###### questions as fleet construction, fleet manning, and oil fuel supplies; after

###### issuing several reports, it had been reconstituted as a CID sub-

###### committee, and thus its survival as a Cabinet committee appeared

###### problematic. Still on the books was an Expenditure Committee, charged

###### in 1925 with 'reviewing] the estimates of National expenditure with the

###### object of making substantial reductions of the charges on the tax payer.'

###### As this group had not met since 1927, its existence too was tenuous.

###### Nonetheless, along with the CID and the Committee of Civil Research,

###### which were not strictly speaking Cabinet committees, these five standing

###### bodies represented the institutional inheritance of the Labour regime.^76

###### That administration reconstituted the Home Affairs, Unemployment,

###### and Civil Research Committees, although the Prime Minister's dis-

###### satisfaction with the last led to a re-organization; the Expenditure

###### Committee was quietly interred, and a new Committee on the Fighting

###### Services established, although this innovation did not encroach upon the

###### activities of the CID. As had been the case with its predecessors,

###### MacDonald's second government appointed a number of ad hoc, short-

###### lived committees to consider specific problems: some led an active

###### existence, some few never met. In the period 1923-39, some 379 Cabinet

###### committees have been enumerated, along with 275 CID and 70 for the

###### CCR and its successor.^77 Obviously, their work, and their demands, were

###### variegated, but each represented a charge upon the Cabinet Office, and

###### the burden surely was considerable, especially with the proliferation of

###### committees examining aspects of foreign policy in the later 1930s.

###### Labour accommodated itself with ease to the Secretariat routine,

###### which renders MacDonald's subsequent conduct in the House of

###### Commons, at first glance, puzzling. In response to a question concerning

###### the role of the Cabinet Secretary, the Prime Minister announced that

###### Hankey's appointment had been continued and that no alteration was

###### planned in his duties; what ensued reads strangely, for Macdonald

###### replied to a supplementary question whether the Cabinet Secretary

###### 'attends Cabinet meetings and makes out the minutes':' I am very much

###### obliged... The statement appeared in some newspapers the other day,

###### and it is absolutely without foundation.'^78 If MacDonald's reference was

###### to the Morning Post's assertion that the Secretary no longer attended

###### Cabinet meetings, his statement can be explained: such an explanation is

###### plausible in view of the lack of any reaction among politicians or

###### journalists, who knew better.

###### Hard pressed by economic events for which they had developed no


###### 182 A rrian and an institution

###### solutions, the Labour government exhibited nagging difficulties in

###### meeting the procedural requirement that Cabinet memoranda be cir-

###### culated with ample time for ministerial deliberation. Again and again the

###### Prime Minister complained about the circulation of documents on the

###### very eve of a Cabinet meeting,' in entire disregard of the rules laid down

##### by the Cabinet itself.'^79 Hankey moved to tighten procedures by

###### circulating a Treasury Minute dating to April 1924 which mandated a

###### Treasury review of any proposal involving new expenditures, although

###### the problem persisted.^80 While MacDonald protested the hasty submis-

###### sion of Cabinet memoranda on at least three occasions in the following

###### year, his colleagues claimed that ' the exigencies of political life' often

###### made it impossible to comply with the terms of the minute; the

###### Chancellor of the Exchequer countered that release from its terms could

###### come only from the Prime Minister.^81

###### From time to time the Labour regime was troubled by ministerial

###### indiscretions, which exceeded in scope the information conveyed in the

###### Cabinet Minutes. Tom Jones recorded such an instance in his diary,

###### pointing to a source within the Cabinet:' Cabinet had, on November 3rd

###### 1929, discussed retirement Pensions and on December 24th an accurate

###### record appeared in the Manchester Guardian and the Yorkshire Post,

###### though there had been no detailed record in the Minutes. No action,

###### warning to Ministers to behave themselves.'^82 Several months later,

###### Jones cited an example that such leakage could be inadvertent as well as

###### intentional or self-serving: the unwittingly Home Secretary, J. R. Clynes,

###### enabled the press to conclude that the government had decided to arrest

###### Gandhi, the Indian nationalist leader, some forty-eight hours before the

###### fact. His lack of circumspection in handling press queries after a Cabinet

###### meeting merited the embarrassment which he must have felt in ascertain-

###### ing through unofficial channels from the proprietor of The Daily

###### Telegraph that 'he had better call off his sleuths' because the Home

###### Secretary himself was the source of the 'leak.'^83

###### In some cases, however, leakage was clearly deliberate, and recrimi-

###### nation followed, as Jones noted in May 1930:

###### The Report of Snowden's Committee on Unemployment turning down the

###### Lansbury, the Commissioner of Works; Thomas Johnson, with Mosley not a

###### Cabinet Minister] as being implicated, at which Lansbury lost his temper. At this

###### stage Hankey put his pencil down, and took no notes.^84

###### Lansbury's close ties to the Daily Herald were known to all his colleagues,

###### and the leakage of the contentious memorandum does not appear an

###### accident. By 1931, following a rash of disclosures concerning the break-


###### Twin institutions 183

###### up of the Labour government, Hankey had grown sufficiently concerned

###### with leakages to take a new tack by attempting to deal with the problem in

###### a humorous vein. Acting at the Prime Minister's behest, Hankey

###### compiled a collection of classical aphorisms and exhortations that might

###### well have been entitled 'On the Need for Cabinet Secrecy.' Perhaps the

###### most incisive reminder came from Bacon's essay, 'Of Counsel': 'But let

###### Princes beware that the unsecreting of their affairs comes not from

###### themselves. And as for Cabinet counsels, it may be their motto "Plenus

###### rimarum sum" (I am full of leaks): one futile person, that maketh it his

###### glory to tell, will do more hurt than many, that know it their duty to

###### conceal.'^85 The Cabinet was amused, and possibly instructed, but George

###### V queried upon reading his copy whether it would have any effect; Hankey

###### too must have entertained doubts about the leaky barque of state.

###### The year 1929 did not pass without another personal triumph for Sir

###### Maurice Hankey, who played a central role at The Hague Conference,

#### which seemed at the time to portend a final settlement of the reparations

###### problem. Initially, Hankey had protested his inclusion in the British

###### delegation, explaining that he had forgotten 'the tricks of the trade'; he

###### expected that 'in these days the F.O. would take it on themselves.'^86

###### Involved in the British contingent at the urging of the Chancellor,

###### Snowden, and the Foreign Secretary, Arthur Henderson, Hankey was

###### appalled to discover that the Foreign Office had not acquired any

###### expertise:' I only had a week's notice,' he explained to his son Robin, just

###### beginning a long association with the Foreign Office,' and found the F.O.

###### had done nothing: - no organization, no interpreters, no [illegible]

###### stenographers, no roneo machines, no accommodations booked, no

###### nothing.' Mechanical difficulties were one matter, but Hankey recog-

###### nized that a more intractable problem could prove to be the relations

###### between the leaders of the British delegation:

###### Snowden and Henderson are not only rivals politically, not only are they

###### personally uncongenial to one another; not only have they poor ideas of team-

###### work; but in addition they were diametrically opposed on the policy to be adopted

###### at The Hague... The officials were ranked behind their respective chiefs, and

###### were barely on speaking terms ... I conceived my main job to be to keep our

###### Delegates together and to make them work as a team.^87

###### Hankey foresaw a task not unlike that which he regularly played within

###### the Chiefs of Staff Committee; he ensured that he would be able to

###### influence the Prime Minister, on holiday in Lossiemouth, by asking Tom

###### Jones to abandon his vacation and return to the Cabinet Office, from

###### which post he would have ready access to MacDonald.^88

###### At The Hague, Hankey's helping hand soon became a guiding one,

since the Dutch were no better prepared to host than the Foreign Office
was to participate; still it was his mediative, rather than his organiz-
ational, talents which were stretched thin: as Secretary-General of the
conference and within the British deputation, Hankey strove to establish
productive relationships. Ironically, one of the most difficult to secure
was that between Snowden and his absentee premier:' Temperamentally
he and Snowden are poles asunder and neither could possibly conduct the
affair on the same lines as the other ... I set myself to support Snowden
for all I was worth... This meant long letters to the P.M. to try and keep
his nose straight.'^89 Thus Hankey found himself in a position to influence
Britain's diplomatic stance, and, characteristically, he chose the approach
which reflected his passionate belief that Britain's world role could yet be
restored. Nor was his support of Snowden's posture simply of the moral
variety, as he worked diligently to free the Chancellor from the shackles of
a Cabinet mandate which threatened the success of the conference.^90 As
his view prevailed in London, and Snowden persisted in his hard line at
The Hague, Hankey could subsequently exult: 'we turned the corner last
night we did': Britain secured terms which Snowden considered
equitable, although the major beneficiary was the Weimar regime.^91
Since Hankey again bestrode the international stage as he had in the time
of Lloyd George, it was appropriate that he revived a' Welsh connection'
in order to defeat any Dutch attempts to intercept phone conversations: a
Welsh-speaking Foreign Office staffer at The Hague accounted for that
end, and Tom Jones took the line in London.^92 Hankey took the extra
precaution of asking that all Welsh or Welsh-speaking tourists then in
Holland be investigated for security purposes,' through channels we do
not mention.' Such precautions, which extended to sending his letters
concerning proceedings to his wife in the diplomatic pouch, reflected the
determined hand of the preserver of Cabinet secrecy.^93
In the meantime, the long association of Hankey and Jones was
drawing to a close; the latter spent much of his last year in government
service re-organizing the Committee of Civil Research, whose efforts
MacDonald had recently criticized. MacDonald's intention 'to examine
the proposals ... for an Economic General Staff somewhat on the
analogy of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee of the Committee of
Imperial Defence' Jones thought a misleading model: 'Preparing for the
next ten years of economic life requires different methods. '^94 Hankey was
if anything less impressed with the possibility of such staff work within
his small office:' It looks to me like a feckless duplication of work already
being done quite efficiently by departments. I hope the Cabinet Office
will be able to keep clear of it.'^95 He cautioned that an expert body
independent of the departments could produce another, undesirable,
analogy to the early days of the CID, when it had stepped on


```
Twin institutions 185
```
departmental toes: 'The result was something approaching a boycott of
the Committee, which I found in full operation when I joined the
Secretariat in 1908.' Instead he proposed that the so-called Economic
General Staff be composed of the permanent heads of all departments
concerned with the economic side of national life, which would have at its
disposal 'the vast administrative machinery of the British Government.'
After a series of meetings attended in the main by outside 'experts,'
Jones concluded that the outlines of an 'Economic General Staff' were
emerging, albeit not on the lines which Hankey had advised. Instead, a
nucleus of civil servants would meet frequently with an advisory
committee of outside ' experts' - economists, industrialists, trade union
leaders - together constituting a body which, in the Prime Minister's
words, ' does more to co-ordinate Departments... not a super Depart-
ment... We should learn by the experience of the CID.'^96 MacDonald
insisted throughout on the parallel, but in fact the new body arose from
what its historians characterize as ' the experience of a wide spectrum of
serious observers of the economic scene throughout the 1920s.'^97 The re-
organization accomplished, the Economic Advisory Council began to
function early in 1930. Jones briefly served as Secretary, and his views on
the new body were these:
It will differ from the CCR in that there will be, in addition to a group of Ministers
primarily concerned with economic policy, six or eight outsiders who will be full
members. Then I, as secretary, shall have with me a small staff of trade
economists whose activities will be directed by the Council and who will report to
the Council on the situation. I am all for this development but I cannot expect
from it as much as the P.M. does. The amount of prediction possible in economics
is not great and it is even less in politics.^98
Such 'predictions' did not much help as Britain's economic picture
darkened in 1930: unemployment mounted, Snowden's Treasury policy
remained steadfastly orthodox, and the Economic Advisory Council
proposed no solution for the problems stemming from the collapse on
Wall Street. Thomas Jones grew disenchanted with its role, a factor
which contributed to his decision to leave government service later in the
year, when he marked his sixtieth birthday. Marginal topics came the way
of the EAC, but there was little direct liaison with the departments;
Oswald Mosley described it as ' a discussion group revolving ideas in a
void.'^99 Jones himself stopped just short of making the same observation
to MacDonald, because he found the Labour government ' dodged the
points' of the ' brass tacks' which the Council was beginning to insert in
the political landscape.^100
As to some degree Jones' functions had deviated from those of his chief,
Hankey, so too had his preoccupations. Nonetheless, when they worked
in tandem - Hankey at The Hague, Jones in London - there is no sign of


```
186 A man and an institution
```
anything less than teamwork; to read the confidences which the two
exchanged is to survey a relationship of trust and tact. Their political
sympathies were by no means close: Hankey walked warily where
Labour's policies were concerned, and Jones, although a confidant of
Stanley Baldwin, remained unimpressed with Tory domestic policies,
especially with regard to the working class.^101 These political differences
were not often articulated - an incident dates to 1925 - and their relations
appear not adversely affected by the few exchanges. In this light, it is
difficult to understand why Sir Maurice Hankey, who nearly without
exception tendered a courtesy to those who left government service or
retired from public life, failed to convey any written tribute to his own
deputy, in contrast to the sentiments of Ramsay MacDonald:
In the public service you have won a very distinguished place - and not only that,
but also the most sincere personal regard of all those with whom you have come
into contact and whom you have served. With me, you have played many parts

... You go and leave a vacancy which cannot be filled up.^102
Hankey's biographer observes that the two had not been intimate friends
and had drifted apart on political and defence issues.^103 True enough, but
the whole truth encompasses more: the two men had, over the course of
nearly a decade and a half, moved in step on administrative matters;
together they had accounted for the institutional development of the
Cabinet Secretariat. What bonded them together was far stronger than
the forces which pushed them apart. Yet in 1930 Jones left the scene, and
the absence of Hankey's regrets impresses one who has chronicled their
interdependent relationship as altogether odd. The two exchanged little
correspondence for the balance of Hankey's tenure of office, and their
meetings after 1930 - judging by their respective diaries - were few in
number.^104

```
Hankey's defence interests did not slacken in these years; of particular
concern was the convening of the London Naval Conference in late
January 1930. In his efforts, Hankey stayed well within the lights by
which he had steered since the conclusion of the war twelve years earlier:
he defended Britain's world-wide naval role and the continued exercise of
her rights upon the high seas, although he did not fare well with his
Labour masters in regard to the construction of the vast and expensive
naval base at Singapore, a development cancelled by the first Labour
government but renewed by their Tory successors. With Labour's return
to office and what MacDonald characterized as their 'general re-
examination of the problem of defence in relation to the political state of
the world,' he had concluded that the possibilities of naval agreements
loomed large. While eschewing any policy which aimed only at 'hasty
"scrapping"' of British forces, MacDonald informed the CID that 'as
```

```
Twin institutions 187
```
security is found, stage by stage by the establishment of sure means of
peaceful settlement, so military organization will accommodate itself to
the new circumstances.'^105
Though Hankey immediately countered with reminders of strong
dominion support for the base - including the promised defraying of
nearly half its total cost - MacDonald and his colleagues were not
deterred: the Cabinet chose, in October 1929, to slow down the pace of
construction wherever possible and to embark upon no new work.
Buoyed by the agreements reached at the London Naval Conference, the
Labour government confirmed the 'all engines slow' signal to the
Admiralty in May 1930, pending a permanent settlement of the question,
to be reached with the dominions at a forthcoming Imperial Con-
ference.^106 Hankey found the Labour scheme 'a bitter pill,'^107 but there
remained the imperial gathering. In preparation for that meeting, the
Oversea Defence Committee of the CID circulated to the dominions
what the Prime Minister described as ' the history of the undertaking' at
Singapore.^108 That Hankey had personally prepared the accompanying
memorandum is unlikely, but he judged that the document neither made
a case for nor against the base.^109 Consequently, he did not in the least
expect a strongly worded assault on the credibility of the CID mem-
orandum, which came from a dangerous quarter, namely Downing
Street. C. P. Duff, Private Secretary to MacDonald and an experienced
hand, minuted to the Prime Minister that the conflicting positions had
not been equitably stated: 'the large space given to recommendations of
the CID or its sub-Committee in regard to the arming of Singapore, etc.,
definitely load the dice against the Labour Party Govt's decision in 1924
and even against the decision to go slow in 1929.' Duff tempered his
outspokenness in writing to Hankey that the Prime Minister was
displeased with the paper, which 'gave rather a pro-Singapore impres-
sion'; he suggested the deletion of much of the detailed historical review.
Hankey countered that to delete the arguments which had in the past
been advanced on behalf of the base would bias the paper wholly in favor
of the present government's position. A bit tartly, Hankey reminded Duff
that' during the last eight years the Conservative Party has been in power
about four times as long as the Labour Party, and it is therefore
inevitable, in any historical review covering the period, that there should
be more decisions made by the former party than the latter, to be
recorded.'^110
Hankey's view had much to recommend it: it is difficult to find
anything in the body of this 'colourless resume' to which legitimate
exception could be taken; on the other hand, a heavy-handed' Annexure'
was a different matter, because it quoted portions of a speech made by
Lord Curzon in 1925 in favor of the base, which played directly to


188 A man and an institution

```
dominion sentiments. Duff weakened his case by failing to take specific
exception to these opinionated paragraphs. More tellingly, perhaps,
Hankey established that the memorandum had been approved by the
government before its dispatch to the dominions; its withdrawal would
pose serious questions. In procedural terms, Hankey was fully in the
right, as Duff admitted that the Prime Minister had 'ticked it off without
comment when it was first circulated as an Imperial Conference paper.'
Without admitting to a faux pas, MacDonald minuted: 'As the paper has
been issued it must stand.'^111 Whatever satisfaction Hankey may have
derived from the capitulation was of little account balanced against the
Labour determination to reduce expenditures upon the Singapore base.
And for his part Hankey had reason to recognize that a shot had been fired
across his bow and that of the CID. Duff's complaint proved a harbinger
of criticism to come, directed against Britain's higher defence
organization.
At the London Naval Conference, where complex multi-lateral
negotiations among Britain, the United States, Japan, France, and Italy
aimed at carrying forward the work undertaken nearly a decade earlier at
Washington, Hankey again served as Secretary-General. What trans-
pired in due course was that America and Britain settled their long-
standing differences first; Japan subsequently accepted a compromise to
broaden the base of agreement to three powers; however, France and
Italy remained in fundamental disagreement concerning any extension of
the Washington ratio system to categories of warships other than those
specified eight years earlier. As a result, the London agreement pre-
scribed new limitations in size and type of armament only for the three
leading naval powers. For Britain, the price of the three power agreement
consisted of a' paper' reduction in the number of cruisers carrying eight-
inch guns from seventy to fifty, at a time when Britain actually manned
only forty-five such ships. Although the Sea Lords resisted the scaling-
down of the cruiser program, the Labour government insisted; the Board
of Admiralty extracted a commitment to cruiser construction and
acceded to the arrangement. Nonetheless, they maintained their position
that '70 cruisers present the minimum for our full [imperial] defence
requirements,' while accepting the lesser number 'for a strictly limited
period.'^112
Beyond criticism were the organizational mechanisms which Hankey
supervised; in contrast to the recent conclave at The Hague, the
arrangements were well-prepared and fully satisfactory. Four separate
series of conference proceedings constitute a full record of the cross-
currents at St James's Palace, and Hankey supplemented these with a
record of informal.discussions among the several parties.^113 At its
conclusion, the Secretary-General received both public and private

###### to warn the Labour government of the grave risks inherent in 'the

###### compromises reached in order to achieve a treaty.'^117 What the bio-

1931 removed from the last phase of this era of European conciliation.^118
The naval threat lay elsewhere, in the Far East, but even there the
Japanese did not move against Shanghai until early 1932.
Two other major concerns occupied Hankey in the sphere of defence
policy in the early 1930s. In one, he deployed forces to protect what might
be called a defensive perimeter; in the other, he took the first steps in what
was to prove a major campaign. In the latter effort, spurred by reports
reaching the Foreign Office and there assembled by Sir Robert Vansit-
tart, Hankey circulated to the CID in May 1930 a document which
questioned the Weimar regime's continued acceptance of the restrictions
placed upon German armaments at Versailles. In a talk later in the year
with Vansittart, Hankey's fear that Germany was intent upon rearma-
ment he found fully confirmed; nor did he think that the forthcoming
Disarmament Conference would provide a solution:' it appeared the very
reverse. It was unlikely that France would disarm down to anything
approaching the German level, or allow Germany to arm up to her level.'
The likely result was German rearmament, and for Hankey the conclu-
sion was inescapable:' the outlook in Europe was very much worse than it
had been ten years before the late War, and to base our Imperial Defence
on a ten-year date advancing from day to day appeared to me to be living
in a fool's paradise.'^119 From this pessimistic conversation stemmed
Hankey's effort to repeal the Ten Year Rule, which dated to 1919, had
been reformulated on a self-perpetuating basis by the CID in July 1928
and had been validated by that body as recently as June 1930. To
document his case, he prepared a survey of military developments in
Germany and sent his tightly argued twelve page review to the Prime
Minister in January 1931; three weeks later, he received a far from
encouraging reply from that office, informing him that although Mac-
Donald did not dissent from his conclusions, he felt that no action should
be taken, pending the work of the Disarmament Conference.^120
Frustrated in his initial effort, Hankey next undertook to ascertain
whether the outbreak of war in the Far East dictated the cancellation of
the Ten Year Rule. The COS argued it should; they also sought provision
for purely defensive commitments, with the Far East given first priority;
and they also warned that their recommendations ought not be held
hostage to the outcome of the Disarmament Conference. On 22 March
1932 the CID accepted the recommendations of the COS, 'at least in
theory.'^121 Yet in short order the Cabinet drastically compromised these
recommendations: they insisted that the acceptance of the COS report
could not justify increased expenditures on defence without regard to the
depressed economic and financial situation which the country still faced;
second, they mandated further exploration of the relationship to disarma-
ment prospects. As a result, twenty months passed before the COS


```
Twin institutions 191
```
recommendations were put into effect, in the main because the National
Government held that national finances posed a greater threat to security
than did foreign aggression.^122 The period between March 1932 and
November 1933 was doubtless a frustrating time for the CID Secretary:
in theory the Ten Year Rule had been abandoned, but in practice its
constraints were operative.^123
He did not shy from the struggle: as the situation ' in the Far East and
Europe crumbl[es] before our eyes,' Hankey carried the case for
rearmament directly to the Chancellor, Neville Chamberlain. At this
time he expressed particular concern with the ' moribund' state of the
British armaments industry: 'Unless... action is taken fairly soon to
place more Government orders foreign orders would seem indispensable
to its survival.'^124 While Britain's capacity to rearm stood as a genuine
concern, one senses that Hankey followed such an approach because he
recognized that the Cabinet was unlikely to endorse rearmament in its
own right. If this surmise is correct, Hankey practiced the ' indirect
approach' with regard to yet another issue.
The events of 1933 - Hitler's emergence, and the dwindling hopes for
disarmament at Geneva - proved decisive in altering the British
government's calculation of the priorities of financial and external
threats: in November 1933 the Cabinet formally accepted the COS
recommendations, and at the same time authorized the CID to establish a
Defence Requirements Sub-Committee which would prepare a program
for repairing the 'worst deficiencies' in Britain's armed forces, measured
against the military commitments addressed in the COS Annual Review
of October 1933.^125 That latter report had not differentiated among the
priorities of those commitments, and thus the DRC, composed of the
three Chiefs of Staff, Sir Warren Fisher of the Treasury, Sir Robert
Vansittart of the Foreign Office and, as Chair, Sir Maurice Hankey,
began to sort through the various short-comings in Britain's arsenal.
While the Cabinet reserved the right of ministerial review which was to
cause further delay, Hankey had nonetheless won a powerful forum for
the pleas which to this point had gone unheeded.
In the meantime, Hankey had held firm to the belief that the
mechanism afforded by the CID held decisive advantages for the
organization of defence efforts over the suggestions which surfaced from
time to time concerning a ministry of defence. In 1931, he developed a
novel brief for the CID, contending to the cost-conscious members of the
May Committee on National Expenditure that the CID was inherently
more efficient than a large department:
Beyond a certain point over-centralization defeats its own object. The head of the
Department and his principal officials lose their grip and there is loss both of
efficiency and economy... From personal experience ... I can say that there is a


```
192 A man and an institution
```
limit to wise rationalization in a Government Department. In my opinion that
limit would be passed by an attempt to fuse the three Service Departments into a
single Ministry of Defence.^126
While the May Committee recommended a reduction in benefits paid to
the unemployed, they did not find reason to advise the creation of a
defence ministry as an effective economy. In a novel fashion, Hankey had
once again prevailed as an advocate for the status quo in defence.
The appointment of the May Committee reflected both the pressing
economic problems which beset Britain in 1931 and the inability of the
minority Labour government to deal successfully with them, since they
had been required to accept such an independent inquiry as the price of
parliamentary survival. The May Committee reported at the end of July,
when Parliament had already risen for the summer recess; the
committee's deflationary recommendations were viewed by a number of
Labour ministers as draconian. We need only consult the Cabinet
Minutes - which were kept by the Deputy Secretary, Rupert Howorth,
until Hankey returned to London at the very end of the political crisis - to
establish the divided reaction of the Labour government to the proposals
of the May Committee. The full Cabinet did not meet until the 19th, by
which time the Prime Minister and the Cabinet's Economy Committee
had met with interested parties, most contentiously with trade union
leaders; at that time, MacDonald discovered that, in Howorth's words,
'the Cabinet were not prepared to entertain the main recommendations of
the May Committee in regard to Unemployment Insurance, including
the proposal (rejected by the Cabinet Committee) for a 20% reduction of
benefits, and also a suggestion that persons who have fallen out of
insurance should be handed over to the Public Assistance Committees.'
Two days later, however, the Cabinet agreed, at MacDonald's behest, to
continue the search for economies sufficient 'to restore public
confidence.'^127
The conflicting pressures, from financial circles on one hand to the
Labour movement on the other, are not here relevant, although they are
clear in Howorth's rather full minutes. The result is relevant: on the
evening of 23 August, MacDonald decided that the Cabinet's refusal to
agree to economies less than those proposed by the May Committee left
him with no choice but to resign as the leader of the Labour government.
He concluded his remarks by stating that he would tender the
government's resignation and 'assist in the formation of a national
Government on a comprehensive basis for the purpose of meeting the
present emergency,' but his colleagues had no reason to anticipate that his
'assistance' would take the form of his continuing on as premier of a
coalition. By midday on the 24th, MacDonald - responding to a belief
that party loyalty had to yield to the higher national interest of saving


###### Twin institutions 193

###### sterling^128 - had taken the fateful decision to accept the King's commis-

###### sion to form a National Government, and shortly thereafter, he conveyed

###### the news to his Labour comrades, many dismayed, and one at least

shocked beyond words.^129

###### Setting aside the question of the political upheaval of 1931, what role

###### did the Cabinet Secretariat and Hankey, who returned to London only

###### hours after the course of events had been decided, play in working once

###### again with a Coalition government? The Cabinet Secretary certainly was

###### influenced in his dealings with the new regime by his own sympathy for

###### what MacDonald and his counterparts in the Tory and Liberal parties

###### had done, in major part because he did not doubt that the drain on British

###### resources had proceeded' catastrophically'; he accepted as reasonable the

###### conditions for a loan set by the American bankers, 'who were most

###### anxious to help.'^130 His basically benign view of the role of the financial

community in the events which had led to political crisis in fact reinforced

###### the hopes which Hankey had entertained of attacking the problem of

###### unemployment which had for so long plagued Great Britain. Nearly a

###### year earlier he had pointed to the need to overcome 'defeatism' about

unemployment as a step towards Britain's recovery of her world standing:

###### 'All classes must tighten their belts and discipline themselves to live and

###### enjoy a cheaper, though not necessarily a lower, standard of living.' An

###### analogy had come to his military mind at that time:

The problem of unemployment is like that of the submarine campaign in the war.

###### It was not defeated by any single measure - though the adoption of the convoy

###### system was the turning point. The facts were put plainly before the nation, and

disaster was averted by a vast national policy in which every individual played his

###### part by accepting temporarily the lower standards consequent on reduced

###### imports, rationing... and so forth. If unemployment is faced in that spirit.. .we

can win through.

###### In August 1931 Hankey was disposed to view the formation of the

###### National Government as potentially the 'turning point' in Britain's

###### struggle for recovery, since he had maintained that no one political party

###### How appropriate, then, that Hankey was asked to draft a statement of

194 A man and an institution

The new regime set to work, meeting in Cabinet for the first time on 25
August, but its Secretary was organizing its activities in the hope that the
'turning point' was at hand: describing himself as 'desperately busy,'
Hankey recalled the days of yore: ' It is a Cabinet of Ten with a lot of
outside Ministers, and has to be run like the War Cabinet, but I am
allowed to send the Minutes to most of the outsiders.' In fact, a
procedural anomaly had occurred at its outset, when a Conference of
Ministers held less than an hour before the first meeting of the new
Cabinet decided that the Cabinet would follow established procedures:
men who were not themselves in the Cabinet helped to determine how the
Cabinet would function.^133 Prepared to defer to the small Cabinet, the
Conference nonetheless specified that each Minister was to receive all
Cabinet Minutes and Agenda, thereby 'enabling Ministers who were
outside the Cabinet to notify if their Departments were concerned with
any subject on the Agenda Paper and to raise for consideration any
question on which they required a Cabinet decision.'^134 Under the
circumstances - Hankey described the new Cabinet, drawn from three
parties, as an ' awkward machine' - such a procedural arrangement made
good sense, but the manner of settlement appears constitutionally
dubious: only a Cabinet, possessed of collective responsibility, ought to
decide its procedures.
The Conference of Ministers also asked the Cabinet Secretary to
circulate a memorandum dealing with Cabinet procedure and commit-
tees, as had become customary. At this time, Hankey was still flush with
the discoveries of Sir John Fortescue, and so cited the irrelevant
eighteenth-century precedents for the work of the Cabinet Secretariat.^135
In other respects, the form of this informative memorandum had not
significantly altered since 1929, although new materials were added
concerning the Economic Advisory Council, which had recently acquired
responsibilities new to those Conservatives and Liberals joining the
MacDonald administration. Yet the transition from one government to
another is not complete, in procedural matters, without some decision on
the part of the outgoing ministers as to the disposition of Cabinet papers.
At Labour's final meeting, they had agreed to adhere to what was
described as ' the procedure of their predecessors in regard to Cabinet
documents: that is to say, Ministers should retain such Cabinet docu-
ments as they desired, on the understanding that as ex-Ministers they
should have access to Cabinet Minutes and other documents issued
during their period of office.' The precedent cited was that of the Labour
government in 1924, because the recent Baldwin government had not
held a ' final' meeting after their electoral defeat in 1929 - Howorth, who
took the 1931 minutes, added a note stating that there was no reason to
think that Baldwin's Cabinet would have acted differently. Finally, the


###### Twin institutions 195

###### second Labour Cabinet went so far as to request that each Cabinet

###### minister retain his own copy of two highly secret memoranda dealing

###### with financial matters; the rationale was that any minister, lacking these

###### documents, would have difficulty in establishing his degree of commit-

###### ment to the economy proposals which had divided and brought down the

###### government.^136 Since these controversial documents had already been

###### returned to the Deputy Secretary precisely because of their nature, this

###### late Cabinet decision involved the deliberate dissemination of volatile

###### materials, although the Cabinet certainly had the right so to act. The

###### result of the decision was that erstwhile colleagues in government, now

###### turned political foes, had armed themselves to continue in Parliament the

###### rancorous argument hitherto confined to the Cabinet. Hankey had good

###### reason to fear for the secrecy of Cabinet deliberations, when the next,

###### public, round was fought in a few weeks' time.

###### A decision taken by the new government also deserves note, since it was

###### concerned with Cabinet procedure: the question was raised whether a

###### minister who was not in full agreement with the Cabinet in a particular

###### matter should be allowed to record his dissent in the minutes. Mac-

###### Donald, perhaps recalling that such a practice had been sanctioned as his

###### Labour regime had begun to unravel, argued that such a record was a sign

###### of Cabinet weakness; the Cabinet 'accepted the view of the Prime

###### Minister that the recording of notes of dissent or reservation was contrary

###### to the general principle of Cabinet unity.'^137 In so asserting, MacDonald

###### acted as if the whole of the Cabinet was greater than the sum of its

###### coalition parties, because they had been unable to agree on an electoral

###### program to put forward in the name of the National Government; at that

###### time the Prime Minister instead asked for a 'doctor's mandate.'^138

###### Although he soon had to abandon the pretense of Cabinet unity,

###### MacDonald's attempt may well have been regarded as a precedent:

###### whatever the source, in August 1950 the Secretary to the Cabinet, Sir

###### Norman Brook, refused to record Aneurin Bevan's professed 'oppo-

###### sition' to measures of rearmament, explaining that such a term undercut

###### the Cabinet's collective responsibility.^139

###### In short order, the National Government divided over the question of

###### the fiscal measures needed to combat the adverse balance of trade;

###### Hankey had done his best to prevent such a rupture in October 1931,

###### through the expedient of slowing down the circulation of Cabinet

###### Minutes.^140 In so acting, the Secretary played a political role, albeit in the

###### hope of preserving both Cabinet unity and the government. Three

###### months - and an immensely successful general election - later, the

###### arguments centering on the imposition of a revenue tariff resumed.

###### Though the Cabinet recognized that collapse from within would have

###### deplorable consequences, that spectre did not suffice to produce agree-


###### 196 A man and an institution

###### ment. In the impasse, Viscount Hailsham suggested that 'in the

###### exceptional circumstances of the day some relaxation might be made of

###### the ordinary rule of collective responsibility.' Those who did not agree

###### with the majority's revenue tariff would record their dissent and express

###### freely their opposition to the policy. Precedent Hailsham dismissed as of

###### no moment: 'That [National] Government having, by its formation,

###### provided one new precedent, need not be afraid of creating a second.' The

###### rationale was specious - whatever the talk of special character, the

###### National Government was another Coalition government - but

###### Hailsham's proposal, seconded by an appeal to the minority by Sir John

###### Simon, proved decisive: the minority agreed to retain ministerial office,

###### their political consciences spared by the agreement that' members of the

###### Cabinet should be entitled to record their dissent from Conclusions of the

###### Cabinet.'^141 The waiver applied only to import duties and cognate

###### matters; on this point Philip Snowden and three Liberals - Samuel,

###### Sinclair, and Maclean - availed themselves of the opportunity.

###### What was at issue here was not the recording of dissent in Cabinet

###### Minutes - that had been done in the past, and MacDonald's earlier plea

###### against the practice had proved inefficacious - but the breaching of the

###### doctrine of collective Cabinet responsibility. In this regard, the National

###### Government's action departed from past practices, although it was

###### within the Cabinet's prerogative, provided Parliament did not object.

###### The Labour Opposition, reduced to minuscule proportions in the

###### General Election of 1931, properly if futilely challenged this departure

###### from collective responsibility. In attacking a government whose leader

###### had commented that when his Cabinet ceased to work 'as a whole' it

###### ought not to continue,^142 the Labour leader, George Lansbury, reminded

###### the minority in the Cabinet that the doctrine of collective responsibility

###### involved more than words: 'no one can absolve another person's

###### conscience. The fact that 16 people have told these four other right hon.

###### Gentlemen what they can do, does not absolve them from respons-

###### ibility.'^143 Lansbury's appeal to political conscience proved, predictably,

###### in vain, and the now-divided National Government went their several

###### ways, in the process establishing a precedent invoked as recently as

###### I975-^144

###### In the first weeks of its existence, the National Government had been

###### ably served by the Cabinet Secretary, whose actions reveal why

###### ministers, particularly the premier, had come to rely upon him. Even

###### before the reassembly of Parliament, Hankey had foreseen that problems

###### might well arise when embittered members of the Labour Opposition

###### faced their former leader across the floor of the House; he confided to his

###### wife that 'there are going to be frightful reactions when Parliament

###### meets.'^145 As the coalition had not yet resolved on calling an election, the


###### Twin institutions 197

###### Labour Opposition was still formidable, and Hankey took the initiative in

###### consulting with other leading civil servants and several ministers to

###### calculate an agreed impact upon Britain's world standing of any

###### abandonment of the gold standard, which the government had been

###### formed to uphold. As early as 28 August, Hankey sought the Prime

###### Minister's approval for his co-ordinating the parliamentary defences of

###### the government,' to ensure that the Departmental brains will be at work

###### on the subject but that material will be collected and will be available

###### whenever you or the Cabinet decide to ask for it.' He noted the talk in

###### Labour ranks of a' bankers' ramp' and advised MacDonald that' if.. .it

###### can be shown beyond dispute, first, that the crisis was imminent and

###### second, how serious it effects would have been, I believe that half your

###### difficulties will vanish.'^146 The Prime Minister was appreciative: 'Most

###### grateful. Make these suggestions into official instructions.' While Hankey

###### sincerely believed in the correctness of MacDonald's actions, his taking

###### the initiative reveals again his personal and institutional value to any

###### government he served.

###### He had anticipated correctly as well, because Labour leaders strongly

###### attacked the government's economy proposals when Parliament re-

###### assembled. There was however, an initial lack of recrimination between

###### MacDonald and his former colleagues: the concept of MacDonald's

###### ' betrayal' was not immediately voiced by the Opposition. In the course of

###### debate on the government's Economy Bill, J. H. Thomas, one of a

###### handful of Labour politicians who had followed the premier's lead,

###### sought to expose what he regarded as the false issues of choices among

###### various cuts in expenditure: 'No one liked the cut, no one desired the

###### cuts, but the choice was not teachers', a cut in police pay, the unemployed

###### cut; the choice was whether we would take the responsibility of a certain

###### cut or of a disaster to the working classes that would have been

###### irretrievable.'^147 To bolster his case, 'Jimmy' Thomas had recourse to

###### what politicians like to describe as 'the record,' in this case Cabinet

###### Minutes dealing with the late Labour government's attempt to impose

###### economies. Lansbury challenged Thomas' account of those proceed-

###### ings,

148

###### and the combative Dominions Secretary retorted in a way which

###### posed a problem for the custodian of Cabinet secrecy. Hankey's diary

###### entry reflected his own ambivalence, because he found the Opposition's

###### attempt to dissociate themselves from most of the economy measures

###### 'disingenuous,' designed 'to curry favour with the electorate.'

###### The Prime Minister had to show this up... and J. H. Thomas hammered it home

###### with overwhelming power in winding up Friday's debate and discomfited the

###### opposition to an extent such as I have never before witnessed in Parliament.

###### Unfortunately he had to base himself on the Cabinet Minutes of the late

###### Government and this produced great indignation. Both the Prime Minister and I

```
had seen him separately and urged him to be discreet. He accomplished this (a) by
sticking to points which Henderson had been the first to refer to ... (b) by
mentioning only matters which had been communicated by decision of the late
Cabinet to the other party leaders. Still, he sailed very near the wind in his very
remarkable speech, and I am nervous for the whole secrecy of Cabinet Minutes.^149
Thomas' speech was hardly 'discreet/ and in certain particulars he
exceeded the limitations which Hankey had likely urged. The Cabinet
Secretary's anxieties were not realized, as the partisan use of Cabinet
Minutes faded into insignificance in the midst of angry and personal
recriminations loosened, in part, by those disclosures.
In early October, the new government decided to appeal to the nation,
ironically enough in view of the failure to maintain the gold standard
which they had undertaken to defend little more than a month earlier.
The political calculation was shrewd, although their claim to stand as
something other than a coalition 'in the usual sense of the term' was no
longer valid, save for the fact that MacDonald, virtually bereft of party
backing, was deeper in parliamentary bondage to the Tories than ever
Lloyd George had been. The staggering parliamentary majority given the
government removed the last obstacle to what Hankey had personally
sought, namely a 'national agreement on principle,' and Hankey's
thoughts in September 1931 were consistent with those he had held for
years:
```
```
While our fighting strength had been reduced by repeated ' cuts' - relatively to
foreign nations - there has been an orgy of extravagance on social reform. Old age
pensions have both increased and extended; widows' pensions have been adopted
and absorb the whole of the money accruing from the diminution of war
pensions; wages have risen... and are much higher than they are abroad; the cost
of education has been prodigiously increased; unemployment has risen to about
i\ million; but the doles have been increased by the Labour Government and the
precautions against fraud reduced.
In reflecting on Britain's downward spiral since 1919, Hankey associated
the items of Britain's economic faltering and the dole as if the latter were
the cause of the former, rather than the other way round; he also deplored
' our insistence on maintaining a much higher standard of living than our
economic circumstances justify.'^150 All of this incorporates an orthodox,
deflationary approach to complex economic matters. Though no econ-
omist, Hankey was very much a man of his times: the long lines of the
unemployed shuffling towards the dole did not impress him as a problem
rooted in the capitalist economies of the west. There is no point to
lamenting his narrow vision; what is of import is that these views
disposed him to co-operate closely with a National Government whose
arrival upon the scene Hankey had to invest with the character of a
'turning point.'
```

Twin institutions 199

His biographer remarks upon what we might describe as the social
sclerosis which had set in by this point in his career, insisting that it was
not a question of capacity:

no visible sign of any decline in his astonishing stamina and vitality had yet
become apparent... Intellectually he was still at the peak of his powers... Yet
something of warmth and spontaneity in his feelings and reactions, not to mention
the compassion he felt for suffering - notably that of the soldiers of World War I -
is no longer so evident ... he never seems to have appreciated what to-day
appears to be the astonishing patience of the vast army of the unemployed of the
period, or to have understood how very hard the economies introduced in 1931 hit
those who were least able to withstand the shock.^151

Hankey, it is clear, had lost his ability to empathize, particularly outside
the military sphere. Yet even in that domain, where Hankey once had
been a force for change, in the 1930s he appeared to many to be the
opponent of reform. Obviously, Hankey discharged his duties in pointing
the country towards rearmament in a meritorious fashion, but even
within the CID there was criticism of his 'inaccessibility,' a product of
the fact that he had 'far too many irons in the fire.'^152 Testimony exists
that Hankey was resistant to proposals to improve the 'system' of CID
record-keeping: 'It is all very well to rely on people's memories, as is
mostly done here. However good the memories, that is not a system ... I
am told Hankey is utterly averse to all change in anything, that he
wouldn't consider for a moment any system for the whole office.'^153 Four
years later - at a time when any margin for error had narrowed greatly -
Hankey failed to respond to criticism from within the committee that
coverage of the economic situation abroad was inadequate.^154 If there is
an explanation for Hankey's distance, even aloofness, surely it is that as a
person - a man of fifty-odd years - and as Cabinet and CID Secretary he
had become an institution: governments came and went, but Hankey
remained, careful not to exceed his charge but determined to serve vital
national interests. Yet institutions tend to lose contact with popular
concerns and common people, and Sir Maurice Hankey proved no
exception. In the 1930s Hankey dealt with issues and judged men
through the lens of his own vast experience; not surprisingly, he lost his
mastery over men.

```
One such issue which Hankey was bound to deplore was the
development of pacifism in the post-war years, because it led to a
weakening of patriotism domestically and of prestige abroad. Such
manifestations of weakness as the past efforts to secure disarmament and
the dangerous plight of the RAF had, according to Hankey, convinced
foreigners that Britain suffered not from an excess of idealism, but rather
'our realisation of our exhaustion and economic weakness.'^155 In such a
fashion he tied together his hopes for a reversal of the drift and weakness
```

###### 200 A man and an institution

###### of Britain's foreign policy with his conviction of the need for 'belt-

tightening ' domestically. That association led to an unusual expression of

###### his sentiments, when in 1931 he cast his first ballot since the war, on

###### behalf of a National Government candidate; even odder, Hankey's vote

###### was canvassed by none other than his monarch, George V, in a

###### conversation which illustrates the peculiar flavor of 1931:

###### [Hankey]: 'As a matter of fact, since the war I have rather made a point of not

###### voting. I have my views, of course, but I like to keep a very detached point of

###### view.' 'But this time it is different' said his Majesty 'I want the National

###### Government to get every vote possible.'' Is that a command, sire?' I asked.' Yes.

###### You really ought to vote.' 'Very well, Sire.'^156

The sentiment, we have noted, was widely shared: even Tom Jones, late

###### of the Cabinet Secretariat and never a Tory sympathizer despite his

###### relationship with Baldwin, admitted to a departure from form: ' I voted

###### Conservative for the first time in my life... Labour had to be thrashed,

###### but it cannot be destroyed.'^157

In the wake of the' thrashing,' the Cabinet Secretary, closeted with the

###### Prime Minister, turned his hand again to Cabinet-making, both in

###### general and in specific. As for the former, he advised against

###### MacDonald's passing the leadership of the House of Commons to

###### Baldwin, since a similar transfer had not worked well for Lloyd George.

```
Further,
I also strongly advised him to have a large Cabinet again. After the huge number
```
###### of Conservatives had been elected, he could hardly keep his three [National]

```
Labour colleagues in a Cabinet of 10, but could do so in a Cabinet of 20. He agreed
and said he had come to the conclusion that this country could not be governed
```
###### permanently with a Cabinet of io.^158

Concerning the specifics, he directed strong remarks against the possible

###### appointment of Walter Runciman as Chancellor of the Exchequer; nor

###### could his approach in this case be described as anything but direct, even

blunt:

###### I recalled Kitchener's verdict that Runciman was always very impressive in

###### Cabinet, but failed to deliver the goods. I added that LI. G. (who, of course did

###### not like Runciman) often quoted this. I added from experience R. was not an easy

man in a Cabinet. He was, like McKenna, Donald Maclean or Samuel (to a lesser
extent), that hard uncompromising radical mind that bases itself on principle, and

###### is not easily moved.^159

###### Strange criticism to voice to the war-time pacifist leader and socialist

###### premier, but Hankey must have known his master by this time; he

###### tempered his criticism with reference to Runciman's 'gift of exposition'

###### and 'competence,' but there was nothing improper about his advice so

###### long as the Prime Minister accepted it, as he did. Nor did Runciman

###### secure the coveted post, which instead went to Neville Chamberlain,


Twin institutions 201

whom Hankey recognized as ' an extreme Tariff Reformer.' Tariff reform
followed in his stead, much to the discomfiture of the 'hard un-
compromising radical minds' who stood, as we have seen, for Free Trade.

Although no major changes were made in the way in which the Coalition
Cabinet conducted its business, the procedural problems which the
Cabinet Secretariat had to deal with in the years when MacDonald
headed the National Government are instructive. Hankey won one major
victory in this period, although his gaining Secretariat possession of
Cabinet papers will be treated in the next chapter. For the most part, in the
Secretariat it was 'business as usual': the tardy circulation of Cabinet
memoranda proved a nagging, if minor, irritant. With such incidents in
mind,^160 MacDonald acknowledged that the Cabinet was unlikely ever to
adhere entirely to the practice of adequate prior circulation; nonetheless
he sought an even earlier submission of most memoranda by setting the
Cabinet Agenda six days before the scheduled meeting. Strict observance
of the rule that memoranda should be circulated at least five days prior to
the publication of the Agenda - in other words, eleven days prior to the
Cabinet meeting - became more difficult, which is likely why the Prime
Minister could not expect full compliance.^161 Where Treasury consent
was involved - in February 1934 MacDonald specified that no proposal
for defence expenditure should be submitted to the Cabinet until it had
been discussed with the Chancellor^162 - the cycle took a considerably
longer period of time before coming to the Cabinet.

The leader of the coalition personally felt the pressure of the vast range
of topics covered by the Cabinet papers; when Hankey was informed that
MacDonald had too much reading to do, Hankey replied that the
problem stemmed entirely from the practices of the present government
rather than, as had been maintained, a proliferation over the years in the
volume of Cabinet business.^163 MacDonald did not mend his ways or
those of his regime, according to word which had come Tom Jones' way:

Ramsay was feeling the pressure last week [November 1932] also and... dictated
a Memoir of protest at the number of Memoranda sent up to the Cabinet by the
Departments, and suggested that no Memorandum should be put up without his
first reading and approving. And this with his eyesight! It was sent to Hankey who
told him, politely, that it was nonsense. He has never really had the charge of a
Department.^164

Whatever Hankey's reaction, MacDonald's request was not cavalierly
dismissed: Hankey's instructions with regard to Cabinet procedures
hereafter advised that it was usual for any minister 'to consult with the
Prime Minister and to send him an advance copy' before circulating any
memorandum to the Cabinet.^165 For his part, MacDonald, ever beset by
such memoranda, insisted that a memorandum in which a minister did no


###### 202 A man and an institution

###### more than signify his agreement with the views already expressed by a

###### colleague was, in a word, unnecessary.^166

###### Two distinct categories existed for the classification of Cabinet papers,

###### although the vast majority - more than nineteen in twenty - were

###### circulated as had been the case since the inception of the Secretariat, with

###### multiple copies sent to ministers and senior civil servants; in 1934

###### circulation of such Cabinet papers averaged 400 copies. Much more

###### limited circulation and far stricter control was given to Cabinet papers

###### dealing with 'specially secret and confidential matters,' a determination

###### made by the Deputy Secretary, Sir Rupert Howorth, who for many years

###### had been responsible for the circulation of Cabinet documents.^167 Papers

###### classified as' exceptionally secret' bore a label including the inscription in

###### red print placed upon each of the forty copies:

###### This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's Government

```
TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY
It is requested that special care may be taken to ensure
the secrecy of this document.
```
###### Only one copy was sent to each Cabinet minister; departmental dupli-

###### cation of the memorandum, for internal purposes, was specifically

###### forbidden. Each copy was placed in a sealed envelope addressed to the

###### recipient and bearing the printed instruction,' To be opened only by the

###### person to whom addressed'; these envelopes in turn were placed in locked

###### 'red boxes.' Such time-consuming controls were placed upon only 2-3

###### per cent of all Cabinet papers, by Howorth's estimate.^168

###### The circulation of Cabinet Minutes was tightly controlled, although

###### not quite to the extent which marked 'exceptionally secret' Cabinet

###### papers. MacDonald cautioned his colleagues to warn any departmental

###### personnel who were given access to the minutes that 'they must be con-

###### fined within the narrowest possible circle consistent with administrative

###### efficiency.'^169 It deserves notice that in one especially sensitive matter,

###### the Chancellor's Budget speech, no Cabinet record was made of the

###### proposals: though the Cabinet was informed about and, in fact, approved

###### the budget before the annual announcement in the Commons, his

###### remarks to the Cabinet went unrecorded.^170 Though Baldwin's return to

###### the premiership in 1935 brought slightly fuller Cabinet Minutes, Hankey

###### resisted efforts to increase their circulation significantly for the balance of

###### his term as Cabinet Secretary.

###### The secrecy both of Cabinet Minutes and Cabinet papers had been

###### challenged during the early years of the National Government, and in

###### both instances Hankey rose to the defence of the established arrange-

###### ments. Oddly, the first challenge had come from the man who with


###### Twin institutions 203

###### Hankey had done so much to forge the system, David Lloyd George, who

###### was prepared to breach the secrecy of Cabinet Minutes in order to make

###### political points at the expense of certain Tory leaders. The former

###### premier took exception to the claim by Sir Robert Home, who had been

###### sent to Washington by Lloyd George's coalition to discuss debt

###### settlement, that he had possessed ' full discretion' in the negotiations; not

###### so, according to Lloyd George, because Home was bound by the Cabinet

###### to base any settlement upon the Balfour Note's principle of all-round

###### repudiation of war debts. In joining the fray, Lloyd George quoted

###### verbatim from the Cabinet Minute in question, justifying his use of that

###### document because Home had already raised the matter in a letter to The

###### Times, he completed a parliamentary rout of Home's position by

###### revealing that Home had been one of two Cabinet members who had

###### initially dissented from the Balfour Note. Home protested: he had not

###### disagreed with its substance, only from the manner in which the coalition

###### chose to send that note 'out to the world,' which he had thought would

###### irritate America. To judge this claim, Lloyd George called for the relevant

###### Cabinet papers, and Home agreed to their publication; more important,

###### he secured Stanley Baldwin's agreement that 'the whole of the discus-

###### sions of the American Debt' should be published.^171 In a calculated way,

###### Lloyd George had taken a major stride towards securing 'a full note' of

###### what had transpired in Cabinet, which had decided upon a full record

###### precisely because 'the discussions were of such vast moment.' The

###### former coalition leader recognized the need to secure the consent of the

###### present Prime Minister and the King for publication, but surely Baldwin

###### was in a position to influence both.

###### Hankey quickly recognized the audacity of Lloyd George's proposal,

###### and Baldwin himself had second thoughts, because on the following day -

###### without prompting from the Cabinet Office, according to Hankey - he

###### assured the Cabinet Secretary that' I could feel assured that the Cabinet

###### Minutes would not be published.' Given this assurance, Hankey

###### assembled a legal case intended to prevent Lloyd George from himself

###### publishing the materials, as he threatened now to do without consent, if

###### need be.^172 Hankey also contacted his former associate, A. J. Sylvester,

###### now Lloyd George's secretary, to convey the word that publication

###### would render his old chief liable to prosecution under the Official Secrets

###### Act as an illegal act contrary to the public interest. MacDonald exercised

###### moderation in conveying word unofficially to Lloyd George that 'he was

###### actuated by no hostile motives... but that it would be a deplorable

###### precedent; that there would be a dozen questions on which publication of

###### Cabinet Minutes might be demanded if this precedent were set.'^173 Lloyd

###### George persisted to the point of asking Baldwin in a parliamentary

###### question whether the government were prepared to publish the Cabinet


###### 204 A man and an institution

###### Minutes relating to the debt settlement, but the latter replied on behalf of

###### the Prime Minister, 'the custodian of Cabinet archives,' that he was not

###### prepared so to advise the King.^174

###### Having failed to achieve his coup, Lloyd George claimed to derive

###### satisfaction that he had called attention to the ' reality' of the Balfour

###### Note, nor could he resist chaffing Hankey about the threat directed

###### against him, as he turned to a journalist, in Hankey's presence, and

###### remarked,' in a bantering way, " if I give you the Minutes of the Cabinet

###### to publish you will be subjected to the most terrible penalties".'^175 He

###### was less amused, however, when what amounted to a review of the

###### incident occurred in the debates of his old bugbear, the House of Lords.

###### His threat to publish was the implicit subject of an inquiry raised by Lord

###### Rankeillour 'whether the business of the King's Ministers... shall be

###### conducted under an implication of secrecy or not.' Although Rankeillour

###### recognized that the character of modern government made secrecy more

###### difficult to maintain, he insisted that it was essential to preserve secrecy of

###### Cabinet deliberations by recording only Cabinet decisions, and not any

###### opinions or divisions within the discussion.^176 Another peer went further:

###### the Marquess of Salisbury insisted that any record at all compromised the

###### essentials of Cabinet government, namely 'freedom of discussion,

###### freedom of opinion and freedom of decision, formed upon that freedom of

###### opinion and discussion.'^177

###### In responding for the government, Viscount Hailsham pointed to the

###### lesser danger of keeping a record only of Cabinet Conclusions, as at

###### present, but he added that he ' should be very sorry if a system of keeping

###### Cabinet minutes were ever to grow up.' Contending that the recent

###### episode was a product of certain 'misunderstandings,' he accepted the

###### view that full records would stifle what Salisbury had referred to as

###### 'freedom of discussion':

###### It would be an intolerable position if in discussions in the Cabinet individual

###### Ministers had to remember that whatever they said in the course of a discussion,

###### the thoughts which they may have expressed aloud on matters which they had not

###### thoroughly thrashed out, and opinions which they had put forward for discussion

###### and consideration, would be allowed to be brought up against them with charges

###### of inconsistency if they departed from them.^178

###### While Hailsham's remarks blunted the force of any nostalgia for a

###### Twin institutions 205

###### coalition had wished a full record of their deliberations on the American

###### debt settlement.

###### For his part, Lloyd George was infuriated with the aspersions cast his

###### way by way of 'misunderstandings,' and he informed the House of

###### Commons that the present government's position was distorted:

###### The question is not whether a Minister is entitled to give publicity to what

###### happens inside a Cabinet. The question is, when a Minister or ex-Minister does

###### publish a one-sided account of a transaction [e.g., Home's letter to The Times],

###### whether the other Ministers concerned are not entitled to publish the whole of the

###### proceedings in order to make quite clear what did happen... especially if there is

##### documentary proof.

###### What then, the war leader inquired, if the Sovereign, who was consti-

###### tutionally obliged to take the advice of his chief minister - ' bound to be

###### more or less partial in the matter' - refused permission to publish? ' The

###### person who is damnified, as it were, by the partial disclosures has no

###### remedy at all - none.' Lloyd George threatened in such a case to proceed

###### independently: 'if partial disclosures of this kind are given again of

###### transactions which occurred during the time when I was at the head of a

###### Government I should, without any hesitation, take the responsibility of

###### publishing the whole transaction.'^179 Thus the threat to reveal Cabinet

###### deliberations persisted, even if only in one well-informed quarter.

###### Yet Hankey could look upon the incident as a closely contested victory

###### for the secrecy of Cabinet proceedings, since Lloyd George had not

###### pressed his case to the point of publishing Cabinet Minutes. Perhaps

###### more symbolic for the Cabinet Secretary was his discovery, in the midst

###### of the incident, of Sir Robert Home 'refreshing his memory for the

###### second time on the Cabinet Minutes'^180 held at Whitehall Gardens. The

###### Cabinet Office was precisely the location where Hankey wished to lodge

###### all Cabinet documents, for one and all former Cabinet ministers, and

###### shortly Hankey was to renew his efforts to secure that control in the name

###### of Cabinet secrecy.

###### On the other hand, Lloyd George's threats to publish must have been

###### associated in Hankey's mind with the criticisms he had articulated

###### concerning the partial, distorted, misleading, and occasionally false

###### memoirs and autobiographies written by military leaders in the attempt

###### to vilify the civilian war leaders, most conspicuously himself: he had oft

###### times announced his intention to write war memoirs in order to correct

###### the record left by others. And now Lloyd George was bringing to fruition

###### the decade-old project of writing those memoirs: his interest, which had

###### been sporadic, revived during his illness in 1931 - intimation of

###### mortality? - and he had instructed several of his assistants to begin to

#### prepare materials for the first volume.^181 It is clear that the passage of time

###### had not lessened the hostility and contempt which Lloyd George felt for


206 A man and an institution

those memoir warriors who for fifteen years had directed against him ' a
stream of criticism polluted with much poisonous antagonism... the
books published by Generals and Admirals and their minions have all
quoted - or summarized very unfairly - official secret documents. My
shelves here [at Churt] groan under their mutilated, bowdlerised,
distorted quotations.'^182
In view of the former premier's commitment 'to tell the entire truth,'
Hankey's involvement in' vetting' these memoirs proved to be a sensitive
task. Although the Cabinet Secretary's view of Lloyd George as 'the man
who had won the war' had held firm,^183 he had to protect what tatters were
left of the secrecy of war-time Cabinet deliberations, if only to bolster the
case for the preservation of post-war Cabinet privacy. Second, Hankey
was sincerely anxious, as we have seen, to spare the historical reputations
of all Cabinet ministers from attacks by their former colleagues; he
deprecated the practice of hauling ' national heroes' from their pedestals.
For this reason, he had urged Winston Churchill to temper his criticism
of Lloyd George in his memoirs; now in a sense he returned the favor,
since it was at Hankey's behest that Lloyd George revised some passages
in the third volume of his memoirs which were critical of Britain's future
leader, producing what Lloyd George called 'a refurbished Winston.'
Hankey's criticisms of the six volumes of war memoirs show his close
attention to the text, his careful checking of documentation against
records and recollections, and his scrupulous attempts to secure a fair
measure of objectivity in Lloyd George's memoirs: very nearly all his
influence was concentrated on the' official' dimension of the memoirs, for
the over-riding purpose of'vetting' was to protect Cabinet proceedings.
The interpretive aspect of the war memoirs was another matter, but
Hankey hazarded criticism, in the main to temper some outburst on
Lloyd George's part. Then too, he supplied some aid, in the form of
documents lacking in Lloyd George's extensive collection, for clarifi-
cation of certain matters; Hankey asked only that certain CID papers
which he forwarded be returned, since they were file copies. One
discovers these in the Lloyd George Papers with a sense of irony!^184 For all
his efforts, the Cabinet Secretary played only an advisory role, and Lloyd
George had to seek release from the Privy Counsellor's Oath and guard
against violation of the Official Secrets Act.^185
MacDonald's refusal to publish a post-war Cabinet Minute may have
raised a question in Lloyd George's mind concerning official approval of
his memoirs, but there is no evidence that any obstacles were placed in his
path; nor is there any reason to think that MacDonald himself played
anything other than a pro forma role in approving publication. In fact,
Stanley Baldwin assumed the responsibility of approving the memoirs,
although he deferred to Hankey's scrutiny; nonetheless, Baldwin's


Twin institutions 207

comment upon reading the first volume captures the mixture of official
propriety and personal animus which consistently marks Lloyd George's
work:

I agree with Hankey: for him it is restrained. But there are plenty of back-handers
in it. Grey is evidently one of his bete-noires, and he has a nasty chapter on him.
McKenna is another, and he gives a good claw. The Brass Hats get it all through.
His chapter on Bonar is good and very fair. He has been quite judicious in the use
of State papers and again I agree with Hankey that he has used nothing to which
exception can be taken. Others have sinned more in that respect.^186

Keeping Lloyd George on the straight-and-narrow was not without
difficulties, Baldwin informed Tom Jones a year later:' Hankey is having
an acrimonious, no, not acrimonious, correspondence with L.G. over the
third volume of the Memoirs - they are friendly, of course, but Hankey
is trying to keep him to the facts.'^187 After he became premier, Baldwin
continued his official scrutiny, and although Lloyd George became even
more contemptuous of the military leadership - '"The soldiers are
getting it in the neck on every other page'" Baldwin commented about
the fifth, penultimate volume^188 - he did not transgress the bounds of
propriety. Nor did the severe tightening of Cabinet Office control of
Cabinet papers, accomplished by Hankey in 1934, pose any problem for
Lloyd George, although he had feared at first that his use of documents,
which were usually incorporated within his account without indication of
quotation or even attribution,^189 would be curtailed; in that event, Lloyd
George had in mind' taking all the stuff abroad and publishing it there.'^190
The Secretariat's recovery of Cabinet papers, described below, did
serve to make more prominent the King's ultimate sanction in publishing
official papers, which Hankey had hitherto taken quite for granted,
assuming that 'when the Prime Minister gives permission without
submission to the King, such permission is in effect being given on His
Majesty's behalf.'^191 MacDonald, however, took the royal sanction as a
literal requirement,^192 and although Lloyd George felt differently on that
point, he did submit to George V a chapter, written at Hankey's
diplomatic request,^193 concerning the King's contribution to the war
effort. That effort sat well with George V, but he was less than pleased
with certain derogatory references to MacDonald's war role and re-
quested that the offending passages be deleted; Lloyd George, according
to Frances Stevenson, was

furious and says he will certainly not do this, and that H.M. has no right to make
the request. The only effect of the King's interference is to make D. rewrite the
passage on R.M. in the chapter on Labour Unrest, and strengthen the case against
Ramsay in doing so - make it more hostile and more vehement.^194

Royal sanction did not translate into royal influence over David Lloyd
George.


###### 208 A man and an institution

###### Hankey served his former chief in another unofficial way by suggesting

###### that he invite a military authority, Basil Liddell Hart, to review his

###### manuscript from the standpoint of strategy and tactics; at Lloyd George's

###### expense, Liddell Hart worked with the war leader for several years. Since

###### Lloyd George's memoirs have drawn historical scorn - and they no doubt

###### contain significant errors of commission

(^195) - Liddell Hart's opinion is

###### interesting, and it is very probable that Hankey would not have disagreed

###### with Liddell Hart's view:

the data for his war memoirs was extraordinarily full and accurate - far superior to
that of his critics. Its presentation in final form was his own, but I saw so much of
the process of composition at close quarters ... as to appreciate that it had
deviated far less from the trend of the evidence than most of the memoirs
produced by statesmen and soldiers, while providing a much more solid basis of
factual evidence on the great decisions.

###### Why then the controversial nature of the War Memoirs} Liddell Hart

###### thought the problem Lloyd George's inability to use 'restrained lan-

###### guage': ' It was the pungency with which he drove home his points that

###### produced such violent reactions both during his ministerial career and

###### when he came to write his account of the war.'^196 Of course Lloyd George

###### had the advantage of utilizing official materials within the text, so long as

###### they were not identified as such; such was by no means an even-handed

###### practice, because those who had been outside the Cabinet, yet figured in

###### the war events, lacked any means of access to the former premier's source.

###### The first former official to complain of such discriminatory treatment

###### was the erstwhile Treasury adviser, John Maynard Keynes, who

###### protested the inclusion, in Lloyd George's second volume, of extracts

###### from a memorandum attributed to him and allegedly circulated to the

###### Cabinet in September 1915; he noted that he possessed no copy and had

###### 'little or no memory of its contents.' Keynes insisted that he was entitled

###### to a copy: ' Since it has been quoted from fairly extensively in print, and

###### made the basis of an attack on a Civil Servant by a Cabinet Minister of the

###### day, presumably it is regarded as a public document.'^197 Hankey

###### sidestepped that issue, explaining that no government had come to terms

###### with it, but he showed little sympathy for Lloyd George's old detractor:

###### 'The War Cabinet Office was not started until December 1916, and

###### although I have had our records searched, I can find no trace of the

###### document you mention. I suggest you try the Treasury.'^198

###### Evidently Keynes fared better there, since he showed a familiarity with

###### the document when, a month later, he aired his grievance in The Times:

###### Keynes protested that Lloyd George had excerpted a ' few sentences of a

###### lengthy document, detached from their context and from the setting of

###### the facts to which they were directed.' His own hands were tied, since an

###### ex-civil servant was free ' neither to publish nor to defend what he wrote


###### Twin institutions 209

###### in an official capacity,' despite the fact that a former premier had quoted

###### from it. Keynes did not dispute the soundness of the principle involved,

###### which he thought' in the interests of the Civil Service,' but he contended

###### that the government had created an anomaly by publishing memoranda

###### signed by civil servants among Foreign Office papers.^199 Now the

###### situation had worsened: 'The publication ... by an ex-Prime Minister

###### with abusive comment of a selected extract from official advice given by a

###### Civil Servant to another Minister seems to carry the doubtful precedent

###### somewhat farther.'^200 The anomaly persisted: cries of discrimination,

###### whether voiced by interested parties - former civil servants - or by

###### disinterested historians, both denied access to documents used by former

###### ministers in the preparation of their memoirs, fell upon deaf ears for

###### another thirty-odd years. As for Keynes' foray, Lloyd George did not

###### spare him when, later in the decade, he turned his historical attention to

###### the Paris Peace Conference. While' vetting' that particular book, Hankey

###### conveyed the Treasury desire that reference to Keynes by name ought to

###### be avoided, explaining that 'Keynes was discharging his duties as an

###### official; that as such he was bound to do his best to comply with the

###### general wishes of Ministers; and that he had a right to official

###### anonymity.' Yet he failed expressly to add his own weight to that request:

###### 'I expect that your reply to this would be that Keynes forfeited his

###### privilege as a former official by hastily retiring to write his book.'^201 The

###### specific reference stood.

###### Whatever criticism may be directed against Lloyd George for his

###### partisan use of official documents, there can be no doubt that he drew

###### more extensively upon the full range of war-time Cabinet documents

###### than did anyone else, Churchill included, and his mastery of those

###### sources was not rivaled until Hankey himself published his memoirs of

###### the war years - and Hankey, by what proved to be a bitter irony, was

###### denied permission until 1961 to publish his account. Ultimately,

###### however, the opening of the Cabinet papers afforded historians a similar

###### opportunity to draw upon relevant sources in order to assess the conduct

###### and concerns of the British government during the Great War.


## Hankey's last years

###### If Sir Maurice Hankey needed a reminder that a recurrence of the

###### disclosure of Cabinet business which had followed the Great War would

###### undermine the secrecy built round that body in the post-war years, the

###### exchange with Lloyd George surely served that purpose. Yet during that

###### time his attempts to gain Cabinet Office custody of the papers of outgoing

###### administrations had met with frustration. In 1934 the story proved to

###### have quite a different ending, as the National Government acted upon the

###### Secretariat's request to regain custody of those Cabinet papers. Though

###### Hankey of course needed Cabinet approval to initiate his 'paper'

###### campaign, the mandate for governmental secrecy generally had

###### strengthened of late: in particular, the Official Secrets Act had emerged

###### from the shadows of its post-war revision - in 1920 undertaken almost

###### entirely as a means of combating espionage and terrorism - as legislation

###### with broad implications for the maintenance of government secrecy.

###### On one occasion in 1925, the Home Office had threatened prosecution,

###### citing section 6 of the Official Secrets Act, brought against the author of a

###### book about the Anglo-Irish patriot, Roger Casement, executed for

###### treason in 1916; the book was based in part upon diaries which the

###### government refused to allow publication, then and for decades to come.

###### The Home Secretary, Sir William Joynson-Hicks, cited the situation in

###### Ireland as the rationale for his decision; when the would-be author

###### countered that future Home Secretaries might feel differently, 'Jix'

###### countered with a determination that his successors were to share for a

###### half-century: cbut the Act remains.'^1 Yet the regime which changed the

###### tenor of the Official Secrets Act was MacDonald's second Labour

###### government, which had recommended its ad hoc use for purposes

###### removed from the Act's original intent. The Labour leader of the House

###### of Lords, Parmoor, explained in this regard:

###### After an act has been passed, on the question as to what it means, how it should be

###### interpreted and how it should be used we are guided by the words of the Act itself

210


Hankey's last years 211

and not by statements made by either one side or the other at the time the Bill was
before your Lordships' House or another place.^2

Whatever the legalistic merits of this approach, shared by successor
regimes, it is in sharp conflict with the principle that criminal law ought
not be adapted for purposes for which it was not originally intended.^3
Nonetheless, the Official Secrets Act of 1911 and 1920 became law
widened by usage; in 1932 its terms were directed at the well-known man
of letters and former British intelligence agent, Compton Mackenzie.
Since Mackenzie had previously published two volumes of war memoirs,
he had no reason to fear that a third volume - dealing with intelligence
coups and fiascos - would be received differently by the authorities;
rather naively, he anticipated that he would be warned if that were the
case, since his intentions had been announced in advance; he ac-
knowledged that much of the third volume amounted to first-time
revelations.^4 Even after a summons was served in rather an off-hand
fashion - his prosecution had first been announced to the press -
Mackenzie did not take too seriously the prospect of facing a jury, but the
good humor rapidly dissipated as he was enmeshed in the absolute rigor
of the Official Secrets Act: on advice of counsel, he pleaded guilty, as
there was no question but that, at law, he had committed an offence.
Subsequently, he was told in several quarters that the government had
used his case' in order to warn Lloyd George and Winston Churchill that
they can go too far in using information they could only have acquired in
office'; Harold Nicolson wrote to Mackenzie that he had been victimized
as 'a scape-goat... to cover the potential crime of others in the future.'^5
Mackenzie learned as well that the Secret Service had deeply resented
the damage which his memoirs had rendered its reputation and had
initiated the actions taken against him, but the warning was clear to those
who might proceed to compromise government secrecy: the Official
Secrets Act had seriously to be reckoned with.^6 Embittered by the
experience Mackenzie wrote in 1939

that the tendency of our democratic rulers moves steadily towards repression, and
the Official Secrets Act is a convenient weapon for tyranny... there is no clearer
sign of the decay of statesmanship in this country than the eagerness of second-
rate politicians to preserve the secrecy of their own place-hunting and time-
serving.^7
These comments of Mackenzie mark a dawning recognition, widely
echoed in the years after the Second World War, that the Official Secrets
Act, once intended to combat espionage, could be invoked for purposes
less worthy than the protection of the state.
To return to the concerns of Hankey in connection with the business of
the Cabinet: in 1933, a son of Lord Lansdowne sought permission to
publish a Cabinet document which shed light upon his father's famous


```
212 A man and an institution
```
'peace letter' of 1917. While Hankey credited himself with 'a rather
latitudinarian view' in connection with the events of the war years, he
advised consultation in this case both with the Foreign Office and the War
Office; the latter ministry objected to the publication of the document
because of several direct references to the advice of the-then CIGS,
'Wully' Robertson; Hankey agreed with the War Office that such
references were 'unfair to the C.I.G.S.'s successors for they are entitled
to feel that the advice that they give to a Cabinet is given for the
information of the Cabinet alone.'^8 Of course the irony is that, for the
most part, the military leaders had not hesitated to publish such advice as
they had given, but Hankey looked only to the protection of sources of
information given to the Cabinet. Thus the case was very different from
that raised by Lloyd George, but the two together had strengthened the
concept of Cabinet secrecy and extended its scope.
So far as the recovery of Cabinet documents was concerned, events
played directly into the Secretariat's hands. An article printed in the
Manchester Guardian of 6 March 1934, 'Last Labour Cabinet: Papers
Disclosed.. .' caught the eye of the Deputy Secretary, Sir Rupert
Howorth. The anonymous columnist assessed the import of the bio-
graphy written about Labour's leader, George Lansbury, by his son
Edgar:

The difficulties, internal and external, of the Labour Cabinet of 1929-31 are a
matter of history, and of well-known history at that. In spite, however, of the
extensive leakages, so far none of the Cabinet documents bearing on the
dissensions, not even the Mosley Memorandum, has been disclosed. Mr. Edgar
Lansbury... gives long extracts from memoranda submitted to the Cabinet by
the First Commissioner of Works [his father], which cast a little light on its
internal struggles.^9
The implications for Cabinet secrecy were obvious, and Howorth
immediately collated the extracts cited in the Guardian article with their
sources in the Cabinet papers; he discovered that one document had been
classified as 'strictly secret and confidential,' because of its sensitive
nature. Howorth knew from the article that Lansbury had lent certain
papers and letters to the son but had not himself seen the manuscript of
the book: whether or not willfully, Edgar Lansbury had breached the
bastion of Cabinet secrecy.^10
In reacting to what he viewed as a grave offence, Howorth expressed a
rigorous point of view concerning the use of Cabinet documents:
While no formal rule has, so far as is known ever been given [presumably a legal
opinion] the customary, well established and well recognised practice has been
that the contents of a Cabinet document must not be disclosed to any
unauthorised person without the consent, both of the Prime Minister in Office
when the document was prepared, and of the Prime Minister in Office at the time
of the proposed disclosure... The practice has been uniformly followed in


###### Hankey ys last years 213

###### modern times and, as a rule, when consent has been asked for it has been given,

###### the last time being in October 1933, when the present Lord Lansdowne obtained

###### permission ... to publish one of his father's War Cabinet memoranda.^11

###### Howorth's brief did not record the long-held distinction between the use

###### of such documents for the war years, which Hankey had viewed as sui

###### generis, and the post-war era; yet this lapse may be explicable because

###### Churchill's memoirs had served to regularize the procedures involved.

###### More conspicuous is the absence of any reference by the Deputy

###### Secretary to the fact that in 1927 Stanley Baldwin had voiced a 'formal

###### rule' by informing the Commons that those who had held high office

###### under the Crown were obliged to consult the government of the day

###### 'upon the publication of any confidential matter of which they may have

###### acquired official knowledge which may affect the public interest.'^12 It is

###### improbable that Howorth acted in ignorance of this convention; more

###### likely is an unspoken determination to afford the protection of the Official

###### Secrets Act to the preservation of Cabinet secrecy. Such a suspicion is

###### strengthened by the language which Howorth used in his reference to

###### ' any unauthorised person,' a concept drawn from the Official Secrets Act.

###### Baldwin's convention apparently no longer sufficed, if a formal law of

###### official secrecy could be brought to bear, given the Lansbury disclosures.

###### In this instance, the Deputy Secretary was convinced that permission

###### to publish would have been out of the question: 'The subjects discussed

###### in these two memoranda deal with extremely controversial issues of very

###### recent date and still very much alive.' That question aside, the publi-

###### cation of verbatim extracts involved a breach of George Lansbury's Privy

###### Counsellor's Oath and an infringement of the Official Secrets Act,

###### committed in common with his son, the publishers, and the Manchester

###### Guardian.^1 * Immediate action was imperative, 'either under the Official

###### Secrets Act or in some other way,' if a further compromise of Cabinet

###### secrecy were to be prevented. Hankey responded with alacrity, and

###### within a day, at the Prime Minister's behest, Howorth had held

###### conversations with the Attorney-General.

###### In contrast to a number of accidental leakages since 1919 - some forty

###### instances in all, most due to ' a combination of unguarded conversation,

###### and sharp ears supported by astute questioning'^14 - Howorth had argued

###### that the present case was qualitatively different, although not un-

###### precedented. A ' flagrant' leakage had occurred once before, when with

###### the break-up of the Labour government in 1931, the Daily Herald had not

###### only summarized the fateful Cabinet meeting but had given the names of

###### those ministers who had voted against the reduction in unemployment

###### benefit. At that time, he had informed Hankey: ' I think that the Prime

###### Minister knows the name of the person who, there is the strongest reason

###### to believe, must bear responsibility for this act.'^15 Howorth surely had


214 A man and an institution

then alluded to Lansbury, who had a long and passionate relationship
with the Daily Herald: throughout his career the Labour leader had
displayed naivete, a characteristic evident three years later in his allowing
unrestricted access to his Cabinet papers. While Howorth did not specify
an unequivocal connection between the two flagrant violations of Cabinet
secrecy, surely he and Hankey recognized that Lansbury represented the
weakest link in the chain of post-war Cabinet secrecy forged over the years.
The legal wheels were set in motion: at the instigation of the
authorities, the publishers of the Lansbury biography recalled all copies,
and Edgar Lansbury in short order was convicted on two misdemeanor
counts under the Official Secrets Act. The Attorney-General, Sir Thomas
Inskip, did not suggest that he had sought to do anything ' contrary to the
interests of the country,' but Inskip held that he had received information
'with reasonable ground to believe when he received it' that it had been
given him in contravention of the Act. The Crown also contended that a
failure to prosecute would be irresponsible: ' It is obvious that... the
Official Secrets Act must either as far as possible be enforced or it must be
treated as a dead letter.'^16 The latter argument impresses as specious,
since the prosecution was designed to extend the scope of the Official
Secrets Act by judicial interpretation: it had survived for three decades
without such an application.
The presiding magistrate found for the Crown, assessing a fine of £20
and court costs of 25 guineas attached to mark 'the seriousness of the
offence'; he left no doubt of the implications of the case, remarking that
'the main object of this prosecution is to establish the principle that
Cabinet documents... are confidential documents, and must not be
disclosed to any persons other than members of the Cabinet.'^17 Yet an
anomaly persists in these proceedings: why was George Lansbury not in
the dock with his son? Perhaps the problem was legal, because the Act
nowhere defines who is empowered to authorize 'communication.'^18
Possibly political concerns were decisive: might HMG have been
embarrassed at the sight of a former Cabinet minister and present Leader
of the Opposition prosecuted by his political foes? If, as appears to be the
case, the legal action was undertaken solely to establish a legal framework
for the protection of Cabinet secrecy, the conviction of Edgar Lansbury
served the purpose. Whatever the rationale, the selective prosecution
constituted a precedent which has held over the years: no former Cabinet
minister has ever suffered the weight of the Official Secrets Act.^19 The
threat of such prosecution nonetheless remained; for its part, the
Secretariat had clearly won a 'formal rule' on behalf of secrecy.
In short order, the Lansbury leakage was turned to a purpose which
Hankey had long held in mind, namely Secretariat retention of all Cabinet
documents. Howorth prepared a memorandum on the topic for the


```
Hankey's last years 215
```
MacDonald Cabinet: he reviewed the historical dimension, noting that the
Committee of Imperial Defence papers had since 1908 been recovered
from ministers who were leaving office; further, the War Cabinet had, in
effect, decided that upon leaving office ministers should either hand their
Cabinet papers to their successors or return them to the Cabinet
Secretariat. However, the first post-war Cabinet had abandoned that
practice in November 1919, and since then the various administrations
had retained their papers upon vacating office, although the actual
practice varied among ministers:

A small minority retain no Papers and return all their Papers to this Office, either
periodically when in Office, or in bulk when they leave Office. The usual practice,
however, is for Ministers to return certain Papers and to retain others; the
retained Papers being as a rule those of the greatest importance and of the greatest
interest to the particular Minister. It is, however, by no means usual for Ministers
to retain all their papers, and this practice seems to have been generally followed
by the Ministers in the late Labour Government.

Howorth examined what he described as the ' only argument advanced
for the retention of Papers,' namely the convenience of ex-Ministers in
referring directly to the records, but he countered that such convenience
was better served by the use of the Secretariat records, with its indices,
cross-references and general system; he advanced as a case in point Lloyd
George's reference to those records, despite his own collection.
Having dismissed ministerial convenience as an issue of substance, the
Deputy Secretary mounted an array of arguments against the practice of
retention:

(1) There is no certainty, even in the lifetime of an ex-Cabinet Minister, that his
papers may not fall into wrong hands and be put to improper uses. The
Lansbury case is a striking example of what may happen with the acquies-
cence of the ex-Minister himself. In some cases, no doubt, an ex-Minister
will be able to arrange for the satisfactory safe custody of his Papers, but in
many cases this will not be done, and there is a grave risk of Cabinet Minutes
and other extremely secret documents getting by accident, theft, or design,
into the possession of unscrupulous persons who would have no compunction
in selling them to the highest foreign, or other bidder. Many of these Papers
would fetch very high prices from foreign agents, newspapers, and others,
and when, as is bound to happen sooner or later, it becomes generally known
that they are held in large numbers by ex-Ministers (or their representatives)
in their homes, there will be a loss of Papers, a grave public scandal, and the
public interest may be acutely prejudiced.
(2) Every precaution is taken to safeguard the secret character of these Papers so
far as this Office and the Departments are concerned. Elaborate measures
are taken to secure that, even after very many years, these Papers will not be
available for public inspection with other Government records preserved in
the Record Office. The object of these safeguards will be wholly frustrated if
other copies of the Papers are to be left in the hands of private persons unable
to protect them.^20


```
216 A man and an institution
```
Of particular interest is Howorth's untroubled assurance that Cabinet
records were not, in contradistinction to other government records, to be
made available, but rather would remain permanently closed; in fact, the
prohibition held through 1966.^21 Howorth as well pointed to 'the difficult
question of the outstanding Papers in the possession of living ex-Cabinet
members, all of whom will have taken them away under the express
authority of the Cabinets of which they were members.' In short, the
Cabinet Secretariat hoped - with the provocation of the Lansbury case -
that the National Government would undo what its predecessors over a
period of fifteen years had agreed upon.
The Deputy Secretary did not underestimate the difficulty of that task,
what with the numbers and the diverse personalities of those men who
had served in Cabinets since 1919; he acknowledged that some would
'doubtless refuse,' but he thought that most would gladly shed the
burden, and, as a result, 'the area of possible mischief would be reduced.'
Howorth underscored the fact that the numbers refusing would be
reduced given the non-partisan nature of a request from the National
Government, which would also constitute a precedent for any future
party government. On the day after Edgar Lansbury's conviction, after a
short discussion, the Cabinet asked Hankey to request all living members
of post-war Cabinets to return to the Cabinet Office all Cabinet papers in
their possession and to do the same with the representatives of deceased
Cabinet ministers; that the Lansbury case was decisive is clear in the
Cabinet Minute: 'No doubt... difficulties must be expected in carrying
out the present proposals. The moment, however, was considered
opportune for taking action owing to a recent case in the Law Courts.'^22
The Cabinet specified that its ministers were free to retain documents
while they occupied office.
Despite the swift success in a matter which had frustrated Hankey
since 1919,^23 his office was concerned with several cognate matters. In a
note which followed the Cabinet's decision, Howorth commented that' it
seems very desirable to know what is the precise legal position in regard to
the property in these [Cabinet] documents,' in view of the practice since
the war of heading them:' This document is the Property of His Britannic
Majesty's Government. Secret, Cabinet.'^24 In 1931, however, certain
'inter-departmental discussions' had led to a ruling by the Law Officers
which strongly suggested that such a heading had legal deficiencies,
because the two had jointly opined:

```
We are of the opinion that the statement that a document is the property of His
Majesty is more accurate in law than the statement that it is the property of His
Majesty's Government. We think that, from the point of view of possible
proceedings under the Official Secrets Act, the words ' Secret and Official' would
be the most satisfactory to employ.^25
```

```
Hankey's last years 217
```
Yet no action had been taken to implement this opinion, and no change
had been made in the heading of Cabinet documents. The conventional
heading had not been questioned when prosecution was brought under
the Official Secrets Act, but Howorth now thought that the matter should
be explored. Hankey, however, was not sympathetic, because he had
throughout resisted the notion that a change in phraseology was needed.
Characteristically, the Cabinet Secretary thought that the practices of
some thirty years' duration constituted sufficient sanction, and he added:
'it is better to leave sleeping dogs lie.'^26 Howorth could not arouse the
dormant beasts in 1934, and the conventional heading survived as long as
Hankey held office as Secretary to the Cabinet, and, in fact, beyond.^27
A more unsettling discovery was the fact that the Cabinet's pronounce-
ment could not be enforced, because the National Government lacked the
legal power to recover Cabinet papers from former ministers. The Law
Officers ruled that the minute adopted at final Cabinet meetings of all
post-war governments save Baldwin's second 'entitled Ministers to
retain possession of the documents if they exercised the right of
retention.' However, only the minister personally possessed the right,
and any attempt on the part of an executor or an heir to retain the
documents constituted an offence under section 2 of the Official Secrets
Act^28 - yet another example of its enlarged scope. Apparently this latter
point constituted the rationale for the seizure of George Lansbury's
Cabinet papers nearly a decade later, although in defending that seizure
Clement Attlee remarked that the papers were 'Crown property' - a
position belied, as we have seen, by the heading attached to all Cabinet
documents for the inter-war years. George Lansbury himself misjudged
the property of these documents in assuring his biographer that they were
'the property not of the Crown but of the Government of the day, [and]
no legal question could arise.'^29 The question of property in these docu-
ments certainly befuddled contemporaries, but what does seem certain in
these events of 1934 is that Cabinet papers in no sense can be regarded as
the 'property' of individual Cabinet ministers, to dispose of as they
wished; nor were they free to utilize them in publications.
Despite the legal barrier to enforcement, the Cabinet Office nonethe-
less mounted a campaign to secure all outstanding Cabinet papers; the
Cabinet were not informed of the Law Officers' opinion, although
Baldwin knew, and likely as well the Prime Minister and the Lord High
Chancellor, through whose office the Law Officers dealt with the
Cabinet.^30 In fact, the distinction between the rights of former Ministers
and their heirs was tacitly incorporated in the texts of the two letters
which were sent out from the Cabinet Office, respectively ' inviting' the
former and ' requesting' their executors to co-operate in the recovery of
Cabinet documents. In nearly all other regards, the letters were identical,


###### 218 A man and an institution

###### as Howorth generously characterized the recent decision of the National

###### Government, in light of the legal situation: ' the Cabinet in fact decided

###### that members of former Cabinets shall continue to have the right of access

###### to the record copies of all Cabinet Minutes and Papers issued to them

###### during the time they were members of the Cabinet.' As a result, he wrote

###### to former ministers,' these records will always be available to you at this

###### treat his papers decently,' but deferring to the other's seniority:' I should

###### be glad if you will tell me what your view is and what action, if any, you

###### propose to take. I can imagine what Winston said.'^33 Abroad at the time of

###### Howorth's request, Churchill replied in November that in his case the

###### Secretariat's concern was misplaced: acting as had his father before him,

###### Churchill had provided for his papers under a deed which specified that

###### no state papers might be published without the consent of 'the

###### reluctance verged on refusal: he had also encountered a less than

###### universally favorable response among 'the members of the late Socialist

###### Government [who] wish to discuss the matter among themselves before

###### taking any action.'^36

###### The 'difficulties' assumed a more formidable guise when the


Hankey's last years 219

Secretariat's recovery effort was reported in the News Chronicle of 5
October; Howorth, in charge of the office during Hankey's absence on a
Commonwealth tour, protested the' outburst' with which that paper had
cast suspicion upon the National Government's action.^37 Surely some
former minister had sought to enlist the News Chronicle in an effort to
resist the attempt and question the government's purpose: 'Is it an
attempt to muzzle criticism of the complicated political moves of 1931?
Or is it intended to prevent former Cabinet Ministers from using official
documents for the purpose of memoirs and newspaper articles?'^38
Confronted with public suspicions, Howorth moved to inform press and
public of the real purpose of the action - the protection of the secrecy of
Cabinet deliberations. To accomplish this end, Howorth had recourse to
the extraordinary device of meeting the press, a means which Hankey had
utilized on only three occasions.^39 The Acting Secretary contravened a
' standing order' of the Secretariat in meeting with the press to explain -
though without direct attribution - the true purpose of the recovery
attempt and to inform them that 'by far the greater number' of ex-
ministers had already willingly complied. In remarking that' no Minister
has refused to comply with our request,'^40 Howorth's enthusiasm
outpaced reality, as Addison had already indicated a tentative refusal. He
disputed the notion that the request was directed against the preparation
of memoirs, noting that the Official Secrets Act already guarded against
undue disclosure of official materials.
For his newly acquired audience, Howorth stressed that the issue was
the prevention of state papers falling into strange hands:

While there is no suggestion of imperilling national safety or anything romantic
like that, it is obviously not in the public interest that State papers should, for
instance, find their way to the stalls of second-hand book dealers.
That has happened more than once. Usually the responsible Minister has died,
and either his executors have not recognized the importance of official documents
or have not looked after them properly [paragraph in boldface type].
All the well-known book dealers in London and the provinces know what to do
with such papers when they are found. On several occasions this department has
been extremely grateful to London book-dealers for promptly returning to us
State papers which have inadvertently come into their hands.
At other times when State papers have been seen lying on second-hand
bookstalls reports have been sent to us, and officials of this department have had to
go and get them back. In one or two instances they have actually bought official
documents for a few coppers [sentence in boldface type].

Oddly, this explanation had not surfaced in any of Howorth's earlier
memoranda concerning Cabinet documents, nor had it entered into the
Cabinet's deliberations. The ring of 'coppers' is implausible in view of
the apparent legal title to documents clearly headed 'Property of His
Britannic Majesty's Government.'^41 Whether Howorth had tailored his


###### 220 A man and an institution

###### rationale for a mass audience is problematic, but certainly he hoped to

###### secure public understanding of the Cabinet's action: why else talk to the

###### press? The likelihood that the Deputy Secretary was consistently loose

###### with the facts is increased in view of his attempt to scuttle the notion that

###### the recent Lansbury biography had 'prompted' the action; even the

###### Cabinet knew better. At the very least, Howorth had shifted the grounds

###### for the recent decision, although the press clippings which he kept

###### indicate that public interest was neither wide-spread nor long-lasting:

###### The Times afforded the interview virtually no coverage, as its par-

###### liamentary correspondent remarked only that 'dissatisfaction has been

###### felt for a long time by members of the present Cabinet at the use which

###### has apparently been made of Cabinet documents.'^42 The Deputy

###### Secretary had made no impression in this key forum.

###### Notwithstanding Howorth's efforts, the News Chronicle persisted in its

###### speculation about the appeal, commenting that' the intention is to clip the

###### claws of Lord Snowden and Lloyd George, both of whom are writing their

###### memoirs.' The journal did report restrained reactions from several

###### former Labour ministers: J. R. Clynes wished only to know' whether this

###### demand has been made to all ex-Cabinet Ministers irrespective of party,'

###### as was the case, and Arthur Henderson accepted the government's

###### explanation, although he had not taken any action about his papers; the

###### outspoken former Chancellor, Philip Snowden, reportedly welcomed the

###### relief from responsibility afforded by the call,^43 a good omen for the

###### Secretariat in view of the potentially controversial character of his

###### memoirs. Fittingly, it remained to George Lansbury to denounce in

###### strong terms the action which he had done so much to precipitate:

###### This Cabinet has no moral or legal right to tell the members of previous Cabinets

###### what they shall do with their papers or to interfere with the discretion of previous

###### Governments with regard to public documents. I have not the slightest intention

###### of complying with the request. Parliament is the only authority which has the

###### right to decide on such an issue.^44

###### Though Lansbury's initial assertion was, unknown to him, borne out by

###### the opinion of the Law Officers, the latter reference appears to be to the

###### Official Secrets Act, which he had reason to acknowledge. His determi-

###### nation to resist was unequivocal, but there exists no evidence to establish

###### that the Labour leader concluded an agreement with the equally resolute

###### Lloyd George to defy any demands from the Cabinet Office for the return

###### of Cabinet papers still in their possession.^45 Nor was there any agreement

###### between Lloyd George and Churchill, although their secretaries had

###### arranged for the two men to meet to discuss the question upon

###### Churchill's return from abroad.^46 The three men remained individually

###### adamant, with very different results ultimately.

###### Churchill and Lloyd George, at least, prevailed, retaining custody of

their Cabinet papers to their deaths and beyond; contrary to the 1934
opinion, their executors were evidently not required to return inter-war
official documents to the Cabinet Office upon their death. Only the Irish
Treaty, a document of considerable historical importance, was recovered
from the hoard of Lloyd George's papers.^47 At the time when those papers
were incorporated into the holdings of the-then Beaverbrook Library, a
representative of the Cabinet Office took a note of the holdings of official
documents, ' ticked' against a list of Cabinet papers, but no request to
transfer those items followed.^48 Of course the availability of Cabinet
papers at the Public Record Office since 1966 has made the question of the
Lloyd George holdings academic, and the same consideration applies to
the Churchill papers, now in private hands. Churchill himself had
resisted the importunings of the Cabinet and Secretariat with a mixture
of diversionary tactics and ill humor directed MacDonald's way,
although in April 1936 Hankey thought that he had managed to secure the
return of' the whole of the Minutes which he had retained,' but he was to
be disappointed in that regard as well as in his hopes ' to recover a great
part, if not all, of the Cabinet Papers in due course.'^49 In the latter quest,
Hankey deputed his own secretary, Lawrence Burgis, who as a near-
neighbor of Churchill was invited to luncheon and a monologue at
Chartwell: 'I had arrived at 12.45 and it was now 2.45 and I had not
mentioned those damned papers - the collection of which was the object
of my visit. At last I summoned up courage to do so and all I got was
"Don't you bother about them my dear boy; I'll give you the abridged
version of my World Crisis instead."'^50
Though these several collections proved elusive, Howorth had every
reason to be pleased with the results, which he reviewed about a year after
the initiation of the recovery attempt: with regard to 'the safeguarding of
the public interest,' he judged the situation' infinitely better' than earlier.
Following upon an initial calculation of likely removals of Cabinet
papers, the Secretariat had addressed some eighty-seven inquiries,
seventy-one to living ex-ministers and the balance to the representatives
of their deceased colleagues. In the latter category, resistance had come
only from Lady Curzon, who had not replied to official inquiries; since it
was thought unlikely that Curzon had held any post-war Cabinet
documents at the time of his death, the request was not pressed.
Among living former ministers, sixty-two had agreed to the request,
and papers were being recovered from all but seven of these, who had
accepted the principle but had not yet begun to deliver their holdings.
The 'difficulty' had come to center on nine individuals, and as one of
these, Clement Attlee, had not served in the Cabinet and held only certain
'unimportant' Cabinet Committee documents, Howorth recounted the
attitudes of the eight hold-outs:


222 A man and an institution

Mr. Arthur Greenwood. No reply has been received to the original circular or to
the reminders which had been sent to him. It is inferred that he is unwilling to co-
operate.
Dr. Addison has written declining to co-operate.
Lord Cecil. After the whole position had been fully explained to him in
correspondence, Lord Cecil declined to co-operate.
Mr. Lloyd George. At an interview with Mr. Lloyd George's private secretary
some months ago, it was learned that, while Mr. Lloyd George was willing that
his papers should be returned after his death, he was not prepared to surrender
them during his lifetime. There is no reason to think that Mr. Lloyd George will
reconsider this decision.
Mr. George Lansbury. Apart from a bare acknowledgement no reply has been
received, but statements have appeared in the newspapers to the effect that he has
no intention of returning his papers.
Mr. Lees Smith has declined to co-operate.
Mr. Winston Churchill, after considerable correspondence, has in effect declined
to give up his Papers.
Lord Moyne has declined to give up his Papers.^51
Only Lord Moyne, who as Walter Guinness had served as Minister of
Agriculture in Baldwin's second government, lacked ties either to the
Lloyd George post-war coalition or to the second Labour government.
Even with the refusals, Howorth found solace in the fact that 'the
majority are probably as fully safeguarded against improper access by
unauthorised persons as if they were in official custody' - a qualification
which had gone unmentioned earlier. He suggested that no further action
be taken while these men lived, which impresses as a gratuitous
suggestion, although the papers should be recovered following their
deaths. The Cabinet shortly approved the report.^52
In this manner, the Secretariat had very nearly realized Hankey's
design upon custody of post-war Cabinet papers; as well, Howorth
reported that in most cases current Cabinet papers were being returned
periodically to Whitehall Gardens. Such did not prove to be a universal
practice, as some ministers preferred to maintain their own files of
Cabinet papers: with the change of regime in 1935, by and large the
ministers who had remained on in the new Baldwin government took
such files as they had accumulated to their new ministries; two years later,
the incoming ministers of the Chamberlain administration generally took
over the official papers left behind by their predecessors in office, e.g.
Chamberlain inherited the file maintained for Baldwin at No. io.^53 The
latter practice corresponded roughly to that in use at the Committee of
Imperial Defence, where about a dozen files were maintained on what was
described as a permanent basis by military functionaries and Permanent
Under-Secretaries; others, including Cabinet ministers who were sent


```
Hankey's last years 223
```
CID papers in connection with a particular meeting, were required to
return those papers forthwith.^54
In the course of his inquiry, Howorth had identified a related problem
which deserved consideration, namely the historical reputation of a
deceased minister: how could authoritative biographies be undertaken
without access to the official records, which came as a matter of right to
surviving colleagues? In the course of a lengthy memorandum, Howorth
contended that no simplistic formula would justly resolve the dilemma;
he advised that no rules be set down, but that each case should be judged
on its merits. To do nothing would mean treating the dead less fairly than
the living, but any alternative posed' constitutional and legal questions of
no small complexity.^5 Yet his illustration reflected politics more than
these:

```
should Mr. Harold Nicholson [sic] be given access when writing a Life of Lord
Curzon? If so, should Lord Beaverbrook (who I believe was the executor of Mr.
Bonar Law) be given similar access if he wishes to write Mr. Bonar Law's life? If
access is to be given in the latter case, where could any line be drawn? And if it is
not to be given, on what grounds is the refusal to be justified?^55
Given Beaverbrook's past hostility to the Secretariat^56 - to say nothing of
his standing as a press magnate - the notion of his using the facilities of the
Cabinet Office could not have appealed to Hankey; Howorth had aptly
pointed to the tangles of the issue.
The hypothetical question was not taken to the Cabinet, but that body
had shortly to consider an actual appeal for access to the Cabinet records
on the part of the widow of the deceased War Cabinet Minister, Lord
Milner. Again, Lloyd George had served as catalyst, since in his War
Memoirs he had quoted a lengthy paragraph from a memorandum which
Milner had written, giving the former premier grounds to allege Milner's
failure, while in Russia, to perceive and warn the British government of
the impending outbreak of the November Revolution.^57 Lloyd George
had, to be sure, secured official sanction for the extract's publication.
Lady Milner inquired 'whether she might be allowed to see the
documents in question in order that if she saw fit she might reply to Mr.
Lloyd George's observations in a further Volume of Lord Milner's Life,
now in the course of publication.' Hankey determined that the Foreign
Office did not object and took the matter to the Cabinet for a decision on
the principles involved, and he took care to detail what would likely
constitute 'a precedent in future similar cases':
the view was expressed that very great care should be exercised in authorising the
publication in the first instance by ex-Ministers of Cabinet documents, having
regard to the possible reactions of such publication resulting, as in the present
case, in the claim of non-official persons to inspect the documents. It was
suggested that a distinction should be drawn between cases where a historian or a
```

224 A man and an institution

biographer wished to see Secret Papers in order that he produce a better book, and
cases, like the present, where a person with good title to vindicate the memory of a
deceased Statesman desired to see the Papers in order that he might defend the
memory of the deceased against criticism made by some other person who had
published extracts from the document with authority. In the former class of cases
access should, as a rule, be refused, as the historian or biographer should not be
placed in any better position than an ordinary member of the public, and should
therefore only get access to the documents if and when they became available in
the Record Office. In the latter class of cases, however, it would be very difficult to
refuse access to an aggrieved person of a document, the publication of which by
another person had been duly authorised.^58

In light of the discussion, the Cabinet granted access in this instance
and, generally, 'to any person who has a good title to vindicate the
memory of a deceased person and who claims that the memory has been
injured by the [prior and authorized] publication in question.' Three
conditions required to be met:

(a) That the documents must contain nothing the publication of which would be
prejudicial to the public interest.
(b) That in each case the proofs of anything proposed to be published by the
vindicator should be submitted to the Cabinet Office for approval before
publication.
(c) That the specific sanction of the Prime Minister of the day as well as of the
Prime Minister in office when the Secret documents were actually produced
and circulated, must be obtained before access is given by [to] a non-Official
person.

The Cabinet decision provided a means for the defence of dead statesmen
from attacks based on official documents; its 'vindicator' rationale
stemmed from Lloyd George's own complaint about the use of' garbled'
extracts no less than from his own criticism of a dead colleague. In no way
did the action facilitate the publication of 'official' biographies based
upon Cabinet papers, however, and in this regard surviving ex-ministers
possessed a formidable advantage over would-be biographers. As well,
one must note the animus against the 'better book' incorporated in the
Cabinet decision, although Hankey at least foresaw the distant possibility
that Cabinet records might be treated as were other government records.
Clearly, the Milner decision was consistent with the defence of Cabinet
secrecy. Since Lady Milner failed subsequently to secure general access
to Milner's Cabinet papers for an 'authorized' biographer, and because
no other 'vindicators' came forward before 1945, the importance of the
case lies in the future use which Hankey made of the precedent forged at
this time.
Later in the year, the Acting Secretary examined the extant precedents
and the recent Cabinet decisions, likely in the hope of bringing system to
the treatment of Cabinet papers. Several points were of import: Howorth
specified that sanction to use and to publish a Cabinet document was


```
Hankey's last years 225
```
dependent upon both departmental and Secretariat scrutiny before the
premiers, present and past, were involved; as only Bonar Law among
post-war Prime Ministers had died, Howorth did not address the
question of how to approach a request dating to the regime of a deceased
premier. He noted as well that' informal consultation has ... on occasion
taken place with the King's Private Secretary,' an oblique reference to the
fact that MacDonald had recently insisted that the role of the Sovereign
ought to be strengthened. Hankey's deputy expressed the hope that war
memoirs, which had posed problems over the years, were a ' dying class'
which would require treatment on a case-by-case basis. His present
concern was directed to the three categories of future utilization of
Cabinet documents: first, publication by former ministers; second, the
' vindicator' category; and third, the rare need for administrative access to
the documents of a preceding regime for official purposes, not partisan
political concerns.^59 Howorth proposed that henceforth the King's
consent ought to be secured, through his Private Secretary, for any
publication in the first two categories; MacDonald's wish was to be
honored.
The Prime Minister, however, raised another matter upon reading
Howorth's memorandum: he inquired about the continued access of
'official historians' to Cabinet papers, which was - oddly - nowhere
specified in the document. In fact, such access had regularly been given,
since 1921, under conditions laid down by Hankey to preserve secrecy
and to protect collective responsibility. Howorth had assumed that the
official historians were under no obligation to secure special consent,
and, privately at least, he regarded the inquiry as irrelevant, remarking
that 'it would be very undesirable to disturb the existing arrangements
which I imagine work most successfully from every point of view.'
MacDonald expressed a desire to review with Hankey the questions of
access to and publication of Cabinet materials upon his return from
abroad, but no changes in the arrangements codified by Howorth emerged
from any such discussion.

```
In the matter of the Official Histories, Howorth sought to leave well
enough alone; a decade and a half after the conclusion of hostilities, these
volumes continued to chronicle Britain's far-flung military and naval
role. After initial vicissitudes, the Historical Section had gone its own
way within the Cabinet Office, and there is no indication that Hankey was
at all burdened by its activities since its existence had been sanctioned by
a Cabinet Committee in late 1922: 'The Committee are satisfied that the
Official Histories fulfil a useful purpose and that their preparation ought
to be continued. Several of these histories ... are required for the
education and instruction of officers and consequently their preparation
```

```
226 A man and an institution
```
should not be unduly delayed.'^60 At the same time, the committee
recognized that the publication of certain volumes could compromise the
national interest, and thus advised that the Historical Section should be
supervised by a permanent sub-committee of the CID.^61
Such a committee was established in November 1923, composed of
representatives from the Treasury, the Admiralty, War Office and Air
Ministry, the Secretary of the CID, and the President of the Board of
Education, whose ministry retained the chair until the committee was
suspended in 1939.^62 Its supervision was exercised only annually, and
thus the Historical Section stood autonomous in all but name.^63 At its
inter-war peak, no fewer than eight Official Historians were employed,
with a maximum staff of forty in 1925. The tasks of its long-time
Secretary, Colonel E.Y. Daniel, were described shortly before his
retirement: 'to censor every volume; to ensure that no political indis-
cretion that might create difficulties found its way to the public, and to
maintain touch with other Government Departments, most of which are
concerned, one way or another, with the histories.'^64 While there is no
doubt that the Official Histories constituted what had been called a
'National Memorial,' Hankey's description, courtesy of the father of
military historians, Thucydides, applied equally well, namely that these
were essays written not ' to win the applause of the moment, but as a
possession for all time.'^65 In truth, little applause was heard from the
public, surely in some measure because of the time-lag between the
events and publication of the volumes. Initial critical reaction had been
favorable, but the sale of the later volumes in each of the major series -
'Military Operations (Western Front),' 'Naval Operations,' and 'The
War in the Air' - fell off considerably from those of the first volumes; the
minor series, in a relative sense, did not sell well at all.^66 Whether or not in
this sense the expectations of the Historical Section had been disap-
pointed, the end seemed to be in sight: in 1939, the section hoped to wind
up its activities by 1944-5.^67 Though the judgment of its accomplishment
is best left to students of military history, the Historical Section fitted so
silently into the structure of the Cabinet Office that Hankey's successor as
Cabinet Secretary had to inquire whom he should approach in order to
pay a courtesy call upon the operation.^68 Such a query is surely an
unmistakable hallmark of institutional autonomy.
Midst the attention given to the strengthening of Cabinet secrecy in
these years, the Secretariat could take pleasure that recent events had not
been lost on George Lansbury, who in 1934 proved more discreet in his
use of Cabinet papers than had his son. Howorth's description makes it
clear that the former Cabinet minister had not submitted his manuscript
to the Secretariat prior to publication, but scrutiny of Lansbury's My
England revealed that no objection could be taken: 'No documents are


Hankey's last years 227

quoted and little, if any, information is given which is not already public
property.'^69 Cabinet secrecy stood intact. Yet Howorth's satisfaction on
this score was tempered by Lansbury's strong criticism of all 'experts,'
civil servants generally and Treasury officials in particular. Also troub-
ling was Lansbury's inference that some, though not all, leakage of
Cabinet secrets emanated from other than politicians: 'The Cabinet
secretariat,' Lansbury had written, 'with its staff of typists, printers [the
Cabinet Minutes had not been printed since 1919] and others, also all see
the Minutes and most other documents connected with national busi-
ness.' And yet, he continued, leakages which appeared on paper to be
serious hardly ever mattered; in this light, he proposed a radical
departure from past Cabinet procedures.
In a Socialist Government all this make-believe of secrecy would be abolished.
Nothing that happened in the Labour Government in its dealings with the
unemployed and the proposed cuts in 1931 could injure the well-being of the
nation if revealed. The publication of the bare [they were fuller than he recalled]
Minutes of the proceedings in the Labour Cabinet during the four or five days
before we broke up might make me and others appear in some respects in an
invidious position. Even so, I would be quite content to have the whole published.

Yet this did not represent a new position: already in February 1932
Lansbury had criticized the artificial secrecy of Cabinet proceedings,
proposing instead the immediate publication both of the Cabinet
Conclusions and the Minutes kept by the Cabinet Secretary.^70
In this forlorn quest Lansbury now invoked the public's' right to know':
'In a democratic state, all this effort to maintain secrecy should be
abolished. Cabinet Minutes should be public property, and they should
be fuller and clearer than now. The Minutes should record everything.'^71
While democracy's defenders could point to problems inherent in
Lansbury's suggestion, his views on the place of Cabinet secrecy afford a
marked counterpoint to those which the National Government had that
same year endorsed. It may well be a reflection of Lansbury's naivete in
political proceedings that the debate over the need to maintain them in
secrecy has never been joined in Great Britain.
Instead, the strict views which Hankey and Howorth secured in 1934,
involving among other matters the denial of access to Cabinet records to
those interested only in ' better books' - that is to say, those seeking to
write an informed political history of twentieth-century Britain -
prevailed for a period of thirty years after the codification of 1934. Yet in
the middle of this period, a massive exemption was granted for the war
years: War Cabinet papers were made available on a selective basis, only
to those ministers who had served in Winston Churchill's coalition. Both
this waiver for the period of the war and its implications are relevant to
this investigation of the administration of Cabinet secrecy, a concern

which transcends Hankey's years at the Secretariat. The figure re-
sponsible for the suspension - contravention would not be too strong a
word - of the 1934 rules clearly was Churchill himself; in Whitehall
circles, Churchill's ' Personal Minutes' had long been suspected as likely
material for the war memoirs which were expected from his pen.^72 Yet the
Prime Minister did not formally signal his intentions until he proposed
that a paragraph be added to a memorandum which the Cabinet
Secretary, Sir Edward Bridges, had drafted to facilitate the transition
from the War Cabinet to a successor government. Churchill sought to
specify that

Ministers are entitled to keep all telegrams, minutes or documents circulated to
the Cabinet which they wrote and signed themselves... These must be regarded
as their personal property except that they will be bound by the rules governing
the use of official papers which are well established. To these should be added, in
the case of the Prime Minister, correspondence with Heads of Government.^73

When the Secretary failed to establish this point with sufficient
emphasis, Churchill's secretary returned to the point in a more succinct
fashion, noting to Bridges that the Prime Minister desired 'a much
shorter draft... containing] in as few words as possible an instruction
that they [ministers] keep all official papers which they have written
themselves but must return the remainder.'^74 Bridges apparently deferr-
ed to rank; his Note specified that 'such documents may not be quoted or
published without the permission of the Government of the day,' but he
foresaw that Churchill would prevail, remarking: 'After the last war
substantial latitude was given [more accurately, taken] in this matter.'^75
In effect, Churchill had redefined the concept of' property' in Cabinet
documents: however clouded that issue had been in 1934, no one had
advanced a claim to personal property residing in official material! In
refusing to accept any other notion, Churchill secured a radical departure
from the 1934 conventions, and his War Cabinet routinely approved his
initiative on the day the great coalition broke up. Although that decision
overthrew the 1934 conventions, the War Cabinet acted only in regard to
its own papers, in exactly the same fashion as had governments from 1919
to 1931: Churchill's own bias notwithstanding, the War Cabinet was
returning to traditional ways. In any event, although it is unlikely that
Churchill had anticipated that he would be turned out of Downing Street
in the ensuing general election, he had provided well for alternative
employment.
When Churchill, out of office, began to prepare his memoirs, the
Cabinet Secretary, Bridges, recommended to the Labour government
policies to deal with the memoirs of a period made exceptional, he
contended, by the requirements of war-time military security. Essen-
tially, Bridges sought to limit the damage which could follow from the


Hankey's last years 229

Cabinet Office's loss of custody of certain documents; thus, he sought
continuing protection of 'information whose disclosure would be inju-
rious to us in our relations with other nations, including ... a potential
enemy': and of' information the publication of which would be destruct-
ive of the confidential relationships on which our system of government is
based.' These proved to be concerns which the Cabinet Office was
persistently to defend in the years after the Second World War, albeit
without much success for the latter principle of' confidentiality' so long
as the flood of post-war military memoirs rolled on. Bridges strove to
keep most Cabinet papers beyond the pale of publication, while
accommodating his office to the usage upon which Churchill was intent:
' the publication in extenso of official documents otherwise than by the
Stationery Office should only be allowed in very exceptional cases; and
then only when the document is in some sense personal to the writer.'
Further, he insisted upon the maintenance of the procedures which had
evolved for 'vetting' memoirs based on official materials.^76
Attlee's government approved the terms of Bridges' memorandum on
23 May 1946, and two months later the House of Commons was informed
of the guidelines. The Home Secretary, Herbert Morrison, spelled out
the responsibility for war-time ministers and others to consult the
government of the day in regard to the publication of' any unpublished
information which they have obtained by virtue of their official position
and to obtain formal permission in any doubtful case.' He specified the
differential standards which would apply:
In dealing with such applications His Majesty's Government will distinguish
between the position of a former Minister, who has been responsible to
Parliament and subject to public criticism, and other former Crown servants, who
had not had a Minister's responsibilities. Further they will bear in mind that
during the war information that would ordinarily have been published had to be
kept secret for reasons of military security; they will therefore be disposed to allow
the greatest practicable freedom in the use of official information about the events
of the war period and defence themes in the years immediately preceding the war,
subject to no matter being disclosed which would be clearly contrary to the public
interest, or would impair the confidential relationships which subsist between
Ministers, or between Ministers and their advisers.^77
Morrison spared the Commons much of the detailed historical com-
mentary which Bridges had developed in his memorandum; nor did he
inform the House that the war-time ministers had won a significant
exemption from a decade-old practice, although the war years, he noted,
had been granted a different status.
The other distinction which Morrison sought to make between
politicians and advisers proved very difficult if not impossible to
maintain: whether or not grounded upon official materials, military
memoirs of the war certainly addressed the question of the ' confidential


230 A man and an institution

relationships' which the Secretariat had attempted to proscribe. Thus
while Churchill surely had his full say in six volumes replete with official
materials, his critics had theirs as well. The Second World War breached
most of the bulwarks of Cabinet secrecy as the First had before it.
Distinctions there were, so that the inter-war efforts to codify procedures
and to protect the concept of Cabinet secrecy had not been expended in
vain: even Churchill's own prime ministerial papers were ultimately held
to be state property, and, unlike his earlier Cabinet papers, the
' complete' collection was many years later, in 1972, made available at the
Public Record Office.
Those whose government service dated to the inter-war years were
discouraged from publication of memoir-type records drawing upon
Cabinet documents. Hankey had recognized from the first the impli-
cations for his own literary future and that of his past associate, Tom
Jones. Indeed, in March 1935 he wrote to his former deputy, who had
recently contributed a biography of Bonar Law to the Dictionary of
National Biography - Hankey judged it 'a little more laudatory than I
really think he deserves' - to seek ' reassurance' from Jones that he had
not drawn upon secret Cabinet records in describing a particular Cabinet
meeting:' I imagine that these accounts of what happened at the Cabinet
have already appeared in one or another of the Memoirs. You have been
so discreet that I expect you could give an authority other than records
which are still Secret.'^78
The Cabinet Secretary acknowledged that his own prospects for a
memoir account of Britain's war-time Supreme Command would be
affected; already in 1930 he had briefly considered resignation in order to
devote his time to what he foresaw as a 'tremendous epic,' even if he felt
'considerable repugnance in withdrawing the veil from even.a portion of

... [his] official Life.'^79 Despite Lloyd George's encouragement to write
the book, Hankey stayed on at Whitehall Gardens, and in 1935 he
confessed a weakening in his resolve eventually to publish his own war
memoirs; he cautioned Lloyd George's secretary to 'keep quotations
from the Cabinet Minutes down to a minimum. I find the position here
has hardened in this respect.'^80 How formidable that 'hardening' would
prove for Hankey's own efforts gradually emerged, as Hankey had to
persist some twenty-six years in order to gain no more than a tacit
acquiescence in the publication of his own memoirs. True that Hankey
was hoist on his own petard, because three premiers and several Cabinet
Secretaries held against his account what he had deprecated in other
memoirs, namely the inclusion of materials dealing with the relationships
between individuals: 'Unfortunately the practice of doing so started
immediately after the war, with the result that much secret material has
been used, which, in the public interest, it would have been far better not


###### Hankey's last years 231

###### to have published.'^81 Hankey's invocation of the public interest in time

###### was directed by others against his own revelations.

###### The first former minister to encounter the new regulations was J. H.

###### Thomas, who had fallen upon hard times, his reputation tarnished by his

###### forced retirement in the wake of his inept disclosure of budget secrets in

###### April 1936. His political reminiscences came to the Secretariat's attention

###### when Thomas requested that Cabinet papers relating to five major

###### incidents, including the crisis of 1931, be sent to his Sussex home;

###### Howorth saw no objection to meeting this request or that of any ex-

###### minister who 'for reasons such as ill-health or old age could not

###### conveniently come here.' Yet the Deputy Secretary was troubled by the

###### substance of the request, which entailed the 'first occasion on which we

###### have been told by an ex-Cabinet minister that he proposes to make use of

###### post-war Cabinet documents in an autobiography and the case will

###### therefore constitute a precedent.'^82 'Jimmie' Thomas may have been

###### down on his fortunes, but he remained a controversial figure whom

###### HMG had declined to prosecute under the terms of the Official Secrets

###### Act for his budget disclosures,^83 and Howorth thought it essential that

###### Thomas should be asked 'to avoid giving the impression that the

###### information contained in his book had been derived in some way from

###### secret official documents.'

###### Hankey, however, took a harder line to Stanley Baldwin, who agreed to

###### resolve the matter in Cabinet. The Cabinet Secretary contended that the

###### 'right of access' spelled out in 1934 meant that the Cabinet Secretariat

###### must at all times exercise 'control and supervision' over the Cabinet

###### papers; now he asked for a sanction,

###### namely that I am precluded by the express instructions of the Cabinet from

###### parting, even temporarily, with documents entrusted to the Cabinet Office'for

###### safe custody: and that this entitles an ex Cabinet Minister to inspect the Papers in

###### question at the Cabinet Office, but not to ask that the Papers should be sent to him

###### at his home or elsewhere.^84

###### Hankey defended such a proscription in terms of the increased risk of the

###### papers falling into 'wrong hands,' but neither did he show any sympathy

###### for handicapped former ministers, for instance the physical disabilities of

###### Philip Snowden or the psychological problems which Thomas suffered at

###### this time.^85 In his memorandum, Hankey refurbished the Milner case to

###### suit present purposes: the actual Cabinet Minute had simply ruled out

###### access to 'non-official persons' concerned with 'ordinary historical,

###### biographical or other similar work,' but Hankey now asserted that 'in

###### spirit this Cabinet Conclusion is definitely directed against use being

###### made in ordinary work of Cabinet and other secret documents, whether

###### the authors of such works are Ministers or ex Ministers, or other

###### persons.' Hankey may well have pressed the 'spirit' because the 'letter'

was lacking: the 1934 decision had not engaged with the permissible
content of ministerial memoirs; ministers had to this point been free to
publish what they wished, subject only to the strictures of the Official
Secrets Act. Of course a court had held against the direct quotation of
extracts from Cabinet documents, but references to Cabinet proceedings
had not been the issue, in the Lansbury case, the Lloyd George memoirs,
or elsewhere.
Nonetheless, the Cabinet Secretary recommended in 1936 that the
former Cabinet minister be placed in a position which had been reserved
for 'non-official persons,' namely that he had not the right 'to use the
documents to give his version of the various contentious issues with
which they [the documents] are concerned.'^86 Only if his reputation had
been attacked could the former minister refer to the specifics. Thus the
right of access, as Hankey now described it, served the minister only the
purpose of' refreshing his memory'; he had not the option' to refer in his
autobiography to proceedings in the Cabinet, still less to quote from
Cabinet Minutes or other post-war Cabinet documents, and ... it would
be desirable if he could avoid giving the impression that the information
in his book had been in any way derived from secret official documents.'
Likely Hankey distorted the Cabinet's earlier decision because he feared
the one case which would provide an ignoble precedent to loosen the
floodgates of post-war disclosures; for J. H. Thomas to write about
Cabinet controversies would
```
start a new and most embarrassing series of post-war memoir cases. Other ex
Ministers... will claim the right to reply to Mr. Thomas, and for that purpose
will insist on having access to the same documents which he used [a right they
already possessed]. The War Memoir cases have shown how mischievous and
embarrassing is the practice of using Cabinet documents, whether the necessary
consent for their use have been obtained or not. If this practice is now to be
extended to the post-war documents the consequences must be very grave indeed,
and in any case must be highly detrimental to the public interest.
If Hankey thought that the most likely spark would be found in the events
of 1931, he may have chosen to raise the matter specifically in the context
of the Thomas appeal. Nonetheless he did advance a further justification
for his stance, namely a belief that 'the reason and justification for the
Cabinet document system is to facilitate the efficient conduct of public
affairs, and... to make use of the system for the writing of memoirs, etc.,
is to divert it from its proper purpose to a purpose for which it was never
designed, and to bring the system into disrepute.' Surely the latter need
not follow upon the former: though Hankey may have vaguely feared the
future use of Cabinet materials, the creation of a secretarial mechanism
was not a substantive issue unless he resisted enabling posterity to
examine the workings of Cabinet government.


```
Hankey's last years 233
```
In a sense, Hankey's reaction serves to underscore his growing
inability, noted above, to empathize with a point of view which he did not
share; a hardening of his attitudes had set in by the early 1930s. Yet there
is no sign that he had any difficulty in carrying Baldwin or the Cabinet
with him; not even MacDonald, who was absent from the meeting, saw
any alternative to the rejection of Thomas' request and the codification of
Hankey's views.^87 Care was taken - at his old colleague's urging - to
explain the position to J. H. Thomas,^88 who accepted the handicap and
agreed as well to submit the relevant portions of the manuscript to the
Cabinet Secretariat, where Hankey read the chapter dealing with the
1931 crisis with gathering dismay, because he judged that' in certain not
unimportant details, and particularly in the sequence of events, your
account materially differs from our records.'^89 In this assertion, Hankey
parted company with MacDonald, who had given the chapter his
approval, but the Cabinet Secretary pressed to remove the inaccuracies
and an account of the proceedings ' at a comparatively recent meeting of
the Cabinet, including statements made at the Meeting, attributed to
particular members.'
Hankey noted drily that the former minister' ought not to be allowed to
describe what actually happened and was said in the Cabinet - even if his
account is not correct.' Beyond the principle of Cabinet secrecy, Hankey
had pragmatic grounds to object, because some of those former col-
leagues whom Thomas had criticized had not returned their Cabinet
papers and were in an excellent position to denounce the inaccuracies and
to provoke what the Cabinet Secretary foresaw as 'a demand for
publication of the Cabinet records which might even become difficult to
resist.' Thomas had, after all, once before 'sailed very close to the wind'
in referring to Cabinet deliberations,^90 and Hankey required that, with a
squall on the horizon, he trim his literary sails. He took a positive tack in
suggesting that Thomas use as a model the brief reference to the events of
1931 which Philip Snowden had made in his Autobiography, compressing
a four page description to several sentences. Lest the Snowden parallel be
taken too far - the former Chancellor had questioned MacDonald's
motivations in the 1931 crisis^91 - Hankey added in a hand-written note
appended to his letter:' You could include... a sentence, as I understand
you want to do, to explain that Mr. Ramsay MacDonald made every
possible effort to save the Government but without quoting what he
actually said in Cabinet.'
The Cabinet Secretary also asked Thomas to delete an account of a
conversation with the late Arthur Henderson: he invoked the precept
which he had upheld in 'vetting' war memoirs, namely that 'nothing
should be said or done or written which might have the effect of lowering
the status and prestige of Cabinet Ministers and Privy Counsellors in the


```
234 A man and an institution
```
eyes of the public' Although Hankey merely requested the deletion, he
likely held in reserve the support afforded his request by the language of
the Official Secrets Act, which prohibited the disclosure, without
authorization, of such official information as a person obtained or to
which he had access by virtue of his position as a Crown servant.^92 From
the events of 1934 and the formidable shadow of the Official Secrets Act,
Hankey had constructed a fortress to protect Cabinet secrecy; Thomas
yielded to the criticism, expurgated his account^93 and published a memoir
of negligible value. Hankey's 'ukase,' based on the 1934 rules and
sanctioned by the Cabinet, possessed enormous significance: it is not an
exaggeration to comment that those men who held ministerial office in the
inter-war period were until recent years ill-served by the restriction of
access to and the use of their Cabinet papers.
Only lately have sympathetic studies of the likes of Baldwin and
MacDonald emerged which have been partly based on official papers;
whatever their particular merits, these statesmen and their first advocates
were handicapped by the revised rules and severe interpretation which
the Cabinet Secretariat insisted upon. Several examples show the
absolutism which the Cabinet Office brought to the task: the biographer
of such a minister, Sir Walter Long, was in effect refused permission to
publish a memorandum which Long had written in 1920; furthermore,
the author, Sir Charles Petrie, was called to Whitehall Gardens to yield
up the document - Long's executors had assured HMG that all his
Cabinet papers had been destroyed - and to confirm that no other Cabinet
documents were in his possession. In return Petrie received not leave to
publish, but rather Howorth's statement that' it appeared to us that this
would be a case in which it would be to the highest degree improbable that
sanction for publication in any form of the draft... would be given.'^94
Although it might be argued that Britain's war-time search for ' Guilty
Men' stood Baldwin and Neville Chamberlain in sore need of 'vindi-
cation', the latter's biographer, Keith Feiling, was given no access to
Cabinet materials; he was asked to delay publication of the book, based
upon a diary and private papers, because of the official concern that ' a
number of caustic remarks about America, Russia and certain living
people... would certainly cause ill feeling and might do definite harm'
and to excise certain of Chamberlain's personal diary entries which
referred to Cabinet proceedings.^95 The end of the war apparently eased
the concern for diplomatic relations, and permission to publish was given
in little more than a year's time, but the deletion of references to Cabinet
deliberations stood. Such proceedings had to be masked, but Feiling
utilized both the diary and correspondence in such a way as to shed some
light upon the 'official information' which had come to Chamberlain as a
minister and as premier. Of course Hankey was no longer Cabinet Secre-


###### Hankey's last years 235

###### tary, and Bridges, his successor, may have felt differently about the pro-

###### priety of such revelations, or he may have deferred to Prime Minister

###### Attlee's observation that 'the only point on which I am entitled to take

###### any action is the protection of the secrecy of Cabinet meetings etc.'^96

###### Stanley Baldwin, unlike Chamberlain, survived to see his reputation

###### brutally assaulted, and he turned to the Cabinet papers as a likely line of

###### defence, inquiring of the-then premier, Winston Churchill, whether his

###### biographer, G. M. Young, could have access to his official papers.

###### Baldwin recalled the restrictions imposed in 1934, but he thought the rule

###### 'subject to the Prime Minister's dispensing powers' and thus inquired

###### whether Young might go on his behalf to the Cabinet Office to examine

###### the files, concluding: ' It would be some small comfort to see in writing

###### the truth as I see it set out, however long publication may be delayed.'^97

###### The list of the Baldwin Papers supplies no evidence of a reply - the

###### request may not have been sent - and G. M. Young's biography reflects

###### the lack of any official papers for the administration of 1935-7 within

###### Baldwin's own collection of papers.^98 Although Young's own pre-

###### disposition colored his account of Baldwin's life as much as the paucity of

###### official information,^99 Baldwin had posthumously nearly a quarter-

###### century to await the publication of a massive biography informed by

###### those sources, until what Baldwin might have perceived as 'the truth'

###### emerged.

###### Memoir activity was not altogether closed down, as Lloyd George

###### continued to publish, without exception seeking permission, and Hankey

###### played his counter-part role into his last months as Cabinet Secretary.^100

###### In' vetting' official materials, Hankey played a contemporary role on one

###### occasion, since he was asked to write a decorous 'finis' to the dispute

###### between Chamberlain and his Foreign Secretary, Anthony Eden, which

###### had led to the latter's resignation in 1938. Eden had commented upon

###### those policy differences in the House of Commons following his

###### resignation, but he had still to address his constituents when he turned to

###### Hankey: 'he rang me up to ask my help over his speech, so as to avoid

###### saying anything to exacerbate the situation. I saw the P.M.: fixed up an

###### agreed formula on the two most difficult issues: vetted the speech. I was

###### successful. To-day the P.M. told me that the speech was admirable.'^101

###### Hankey's Cabinet Secretariat remained a formidable bulwark against

###### disclosure of Cabinet deliberations or differences, whatever the setting.

###### In fact, Hankey's success accounts in significant measure for the

###### caution and, alas, the lack of detailed political and diplomatic information

ings, although he did include an account of the role of George V in the
negotiations which led to the formation of the National Government, and
he discussed the attitude of the coalition Liberals both with regard to the
' agreement to differ' and their subsequent resignation from the National
Government - much if not all of which had been public knowledge at the
time.^102 Duff Cooper took the novel approach of recording the burgeon-
ing differences between Chamberlain and Eden which led in early 1938 to
the latter's resignation, although the Cabinet had not been kept informed
at the time; he related the events which led to the Munich crisis, which
precipitated his own resignation, largely from a diary, which he quoted
extensively. Although he did not attribute opinions expressed by
ministers within the Cabinet room, Duff Cooper's approach was not well
received at the Cabinet Office, which looked askance at the use of his diary
in connection with Cabinet proceedings.^103 While writing a fuller memoir
than most of his colleagues save Duff Cooper, Sir Samuel Hoare
defended his own contribution to the policy of appeasement, but without
direct reference either to Cabinet proceedings or to a diary.^104 Lord
Londonderry attempted during the war to set the record straight
concerning his years at the Air Ministry between 1931 and 1935, but the
Cabinet Office protested and he made a number of amendments,
although not entirely to Edward Bridges' satisfaction, before publishing.
Yet Churchill was sympathetic to Londonderry's request, for reasons
which are not difficult to discern: the Prime Minister acknowledged that
quotations from official documents could be barred on the grounds of the
public interest, but he added: ' a bona fide interpretation of the public
interest must prevail. The precedents in favour of a fairly free publication
after the war are very numerous - see my own voluminous writings.'
Churchill had also held out the hope of publication after the war of a
volume of Lord Chatfield's memoirs, in which the former First Sea Lord
and, from January 1939, Minister for the Co-ordination of Defence
attacked government defence policies of that era; publication was denied
in 1941, nonetheless, on the premise that the volume would weaken the
sense of national unity and impair the war effort.^105 In sum, the
regulations of 1934 severely handicapped the statesmen of that period
and, as well, the initial biographers of men who either did not live, or
choose, to write memoirs - such as Baldwin, MacDonald and, to a lesser
extent, Neville Chamberlain. At what price their initial - and perhaps
lasting - historical reputations?
While these men operated under restrictions, none was treated with
anything approaching the severity with which the Cabinet Office dealt
with the estate - and historical standing - of the deceased Labour leader,
George Lansbury, whose misadventure with Cabinet papers had set
these events in train. Although in the midst of the Second World War the


```
Hankey's last years 237
```
economic problems of the second Labour government were of no great
moment, in 1944, four years after Lansbury's death, the Cabinet papers
which in life he had refused to yield were summarily confiscated.
According to his biographer son-in-law, Raymond Postgate, who held
custody of Lansbury's papers - including 'several boxes apparently
containing mostly official papers'^106 - both the Deputy Secretary to the
Cabinet, Norman Brook, and a Treasury Solicitor brought pressure to
bear upon him and Lansbury's executor to turn over "'a dozen or at most
a score'" of particularly secret papers which legally, they held, must be
returned to the Cabinet Office. Since Postgate was at this time on active
service in North Africa, he accepted the Treasury Solicitor's offer that a
government official collect the papers and extract the few documents at
issue, returning the remainder.^107
The contents of some thirty boxes of Lansbury's papers vanished in
short order, as Postgate ruefully recollected in 1951:' In the first place, all
the papers that I sent were seized. So far from a dozen being kept, nothing
whatever was returned. I was sent, it is true, a set of signed applications to
subscribe to the Labour Gazette in 1893; but if this was an official's jest or
what I have never fathomed.' Among the confiscated items were political
correspondence which Lansbury had engaged in before the First World
War; the writ of 1934 had assumed a shocking if ad hoc dimension at the
very time when the Prime Minister was intent upon forging an entirely
novel concept of 'personal property' in official documents. The irony of
the situation was not lost upon Postgate, when he discovered that
correspondence had been exchanged between his father-in-law and
Churchill's secretary in 1934 to resist the National Government's attempt
to recover Cabinet papers.^108 At no point was Postgate apprised that the
Law Officers had drawn a distinction between ministers themselves and
their heirs or executors. Thus he pressed for the return of Lansbury's
papers, but in 1951 Attlee's Labour government denied the request.
Further, in the comments which Postgate addressed to the confiscation in
the Preface to the biography, he was refused permission to quote from
HMG's correspondence.^109 With this action the Cabinet Office exhibited
a determination to ensure the continuing application of the 1934 rules to
the inter-war period, although the arbitrariness of the action taken against
Lansbury's reputation cannot be defended. Postgate drew a general
lesson from these events: 'the story raises the question of how far
Ministers, as public servants, are entitled to withhold the records of what
has been done in the service of the public' What he did not know was how
singularly Lansbury had been treated: as far as can be ascertained, only in
his case did the Cabinet Secretariat resort to outright confiscation: Lloyd
George was treated very differently, and Churchill too. Whether the
estates of any of the other half-dozen recalcitrants of 1934 were exposed


238 A man and an institution

to similar pressure, let alone confiscation, is unknown, as are the reasons
for claiming Lansbury's papers.^110 Surely though, the successor regimes
to Hankey's had attempted to strengthen their institutional role as the
custodian of Cabinet secrecy.
A decade later, the Cabinet Office took a further step, in attempting to
close the papers of Viscount Milner, at New College, Oxford, because the
publication of Richard Ullman's Intervention and the War^111 had revealed
that Milner's collection was replete with Cabinet papers and Foreign
Office correspondence.^112 Since the war period had long been regarded as
sui generis, this attempt may be explained by Ullman's intention to treat
the post-war period as well - Milner held ministerial office until 1921.
Under the leadership of Sir Norman Brook, third Cabinet Secretary, the
office reached the apogee of its efforts to hold inviolate Cabinet secrecy for
the years after 1919. It is also alleged that at this time an attempt was made
to persuade the authorities at the Bodleian Library to remove from the
Asquith papers copies of his letters to the King concerning Cabinet
proceedings, although the majority came from the pre-war period;
further, it appears that at least for a short period of time the Cabinet Office
held that records of Cabinet proceedings should never be disclosed and
were exempt from the provisions of the Public Records Act of 1958 which
stipulated the delivery of most official papers to the Record Office after
fifty years had elapsed.^113 Fortunately for those with an interest in
modern British government, such an absolutist construction could not be
sustained.

At the time when Howorth had moved to recover Cabinet papers, he had
been acting in Hankey's absence, though doubtless with his concurrence.
The Cabinet Secretary spent the latter months of 1934 touring South
Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada in order to discuss British
defence planning with the dominion leaders; although ostensibly on a
private visit, Hankey carried out official conversations which normally
would have been assigned to a minister.^114 Such an undertaking by a civil
servant serves not only as a reminder of Hankey's imperial associations
but also of his deep involvement in defence planning. In his stead at
Whitehall Gardens were Howorth as Acting Secretary to the Cabinet and
Wing-Commander John Hodsoll in a similar role at the Committee of
Imperial Defence; such a division of responsibilities raised within the
office speculation whether any successor would combine the two tasks.^115
In the little more than three years left in his combined post, Hankey
continued to pursue relentlessly large-scale measures of British rearma-
ment. To follow those activities in great detail would be superfluous in
light of Roskill's biography and the attention which has at last been given
to the British rearmament effort,^116 but Hankey's continuing influence
upon defence activities cannot be wholly severed from a study of the


```
Hankey's last years 239
```
```
institutional development of the Cabinet Secretariat. The man and the
institution remained one, and not even the creation of a Minister for the
Co-ordination of Defence in March 1936 substantially affected his
centrality in defence deliberations. In a physical sense, the minister, Sir
Thomas Inskip,^117 worked within the defence organization at Whitehall
Gardens, but his activities were closely attended to by Sir Warren Fisher
```
- who has been described as 'virtually... Inskip's permanent under-
    secretary'^118 - as well as by Hankey. Devoid of ministerial resources,
    Inskip functioned within the extant system, in effect serving as a
    Treasury deputy for defence expenditure.^119 Hankey of course kept close
    counsel with Inskip, but prior to that time he concentrated his efforts to
    achieve rearmament within the CID and the newer forum of its Defence
    Requirements Committee.
       In examining the defence establishment's 'worst deficiencies,' Hankey
    differed from his counterparts Fisher and Vansittart in awarding the
    highest priority to the defence of the Empire in the Far East, which
    dictated naval construction; in RAF circles, Hankey was suspect - as
    recently as May 1932, he had entertained the prospect of abolishing all
    military and naval air forces, but the attempt to secure an Air Convention
    along these lines had gotten nowhere, either with the French or Prime
    Minister MacDonald.^120 In their collective efforts, however, the three
    accepted the priorities developed by the Fighting Services - whose
    military heads sat on the DRC - rather than attempt to adjudicate
    priorities among the Services; such a process produced unanimity within
    the DRC but assured that those priorities would be contested at the level
    of Cabinet review. Fisher in particular worked upon the Chancellor,
    Chamberlain, to ensure that air preparations directed against the German
    threat received a higher priority than naval measures against Japan.
       Hankey thought the Treasury-backed air proposals mistaken, and he
    succeeded in achieving minor changes in the configuration of the
    deficiency program, but the Cabinet, in June 1934, actually increased the
    expenditure which the Chancellor sought.^121 Concurrently, the Cabinet,
    at Chamberlain's behest, cut the Army's deficiency appropriation in half
    and left the Admiralty's share open to further negotiation with the
    Treasury.^122 Thus a program which Hankey and the COS had viewed as a
       'balanced allocation of resources between [sic] the services,'^123 in-
       corporated in the DRC report despite the reservations of Fisher and
    Vansittart, was redeployed in recognition of Britain's inability to counter
       an air threat. Curiously, the role of the civil servants in preparing the
       report and of the Treasury in re-directing Britain's deficiency program
    far outstripped the contributions made by the military leaders; nor was
       the irony lost upon officials within the CID and certainly not on the civil
       servants themselves.^124
          As Hankey left for the dominions in August 1934, he had personal


```
240 A man and an institution
```
reason for dissatisfaction with the British defence stance: despite his
painstaking work to produce a unanimous DRC report, the government
had chosen 'to look beyond the menace of Japan to Germany and
pronounce her the ultimate political enemy against whom long-range
defence policy must be planned.'^125 To Pacific dominions concerned
above all with the menace of Japan, Hankey carried the news of a British
defence posture geared primarily to the German threat. The Cabinet
Secretary had been selected in February of that year to visit Australia, in
part to acquaint its government with Britain's 'trend of thought' in
defence matters; subsequently Hankey was charged with conveying the
tenor of ministerial review of the DRC report; the report prepared by the
ministerial committee had not been sent to the dominions precisely
because it had left open the question of Britain's naval program.
Although Hankey thought that he had succeeded in ' papering over the
cracks' in British policy in the Far East while on his mission, the Austra-
lian authorities concluded that objectives had been stressed but that
means to those ends had not been resolved.^126 For all Hankey's efforts, the
'cracks' could not be hidden from view.
Late in his life, Hankey recollected that while crossing the Atlantic to
complete his Empire tour, he wrote an initial draft of what became in due
course the 1935 White Paper on Defence.^127 While there seems to be no
corroboration of his work while on shipboard, it is clear that upon his
return in January Hankey joined in an effort to educate the public about
defence policies, a need all the greater for mounting evidence that German
air rearmament already by November 1934 had outpaced Britain's
deficiency program. Fisher and some other senior civil servants who had
worked on that scheme were again involved.^128 The Prime Minister
remained to be won to the issuance of such a statement, which would
provoke parliamentary debate; Hankey secured his assent to a draft which
MacDonald amended in no significant way.^129 In the Cabinet, however,
some amendments were made, which Hankey and Fisher thought
weakened the White Paper, published in March 1935.^13 ° Once a pacifist,
the Prime Minister now witnessed the highly unusual personalization of
this key state paper on the road to rearmament, namely the use of his
initials, 'J.R.M.,' below the final paragraph. Much speculation was
provoked, but no authoritative explanation followed; only recently has
MacDonald's own comment emerged: 'by accident my initials were put
on to indicate that the document I last saw was the authentic copy to be
put in order.'^131 Thus MacDonald's role was inadvertently featured, but
the entire incident again shows Hankey's use of the 'indirect approach':
frustrated both by the pace of HMG's reaction to developments abroad
and the decisions made by the Cabinet, he and his cohorts - Warren
Fisher most prominent - enlisted the Prime Minister in order to gain
public attention for their pleas.

Meanwhile, the international situation deteriorated, as the Germans
introduced conscription in March 1935: several months earlier, Fisher
had received intelligence of massive German borrowing for rearmament,
an ominous development by any standards. As the COS had not yet
accepted as final the ministerial recommendation and Cabinet decision to
overthrow the 'balanced' advice of the DRC, that committee was
reconstituted and charged to report about the deficiency program as a
whole to a ministerial committee, the Defence Policy and Requirements
Committee (DPRC), at this time acting as an agent for the Cabinet; the
DRC's recommendations were to be made in the light of recent military
developments, but attention was to be given to financial co-ordination as
well. An Interim DRC Report of 24 July pointed to the inescapable
conclusion that Treasury orthodoxy would have to be compromised by
the institution of a defence loan. Although the DPRC refused for the
moment to commit the Cabinet 'as to the methods by which the
programmes of the Defence Services were to be financed,' the ministerial
committee in short order gave the DRC license to consider the state of
readiness which the Services should attain by 1939.^132 Once again the
initiative - and an awesome responsibility - lay collectively with Hankey,
Fisher, Vansittart, and the Chiefs of Staff.
The content of the Third Report of November 1935 is not here at issue:
suffice it to reiterate that the concept of repairing 'worst deficiencies' had
now given way to what N. H. Gibbs has characterized as 'an urgency to
complete programmes unhampered by traditional methods, especially of
finance.'^133 Of course further ministerial review was required, but on this
occasion the Treasury had to yield to other desiderata of national
security: in March 1936 another Statement Relating to Defence confirmed
that Britain had embarked upon a massive scheme of rearmament.^134 'At
long last,' Hankey and his colleagues would have been justified in
commenting, because they had labored mightily to bring HMG to
recognize the danger of developments abroad at a time when the fear of a
much misunderstood 'pacifism' influenced ministerial thought.^135
In that process, the senior civil servants had differed sharply among
themselves: Hankey and Fisher were both angered by Vansittart's
enthusiasm for the Foreign Office-sponsored air convention initiative of
early 1935, objecting not only to substance but also to contravention of
established civil service procedures.^136 The Cabinet Secretary had a year
earlier remarked acidly to his CID deputy, Pownall, that Warren Fisher's
papers were on occasion ' astonishing, long tirades far removed from the
point and irrelevant.'^137 For their part, Fisher and Vansittart had
contested Hankey's sense of priorities in developing a response to
external threats. Despite the differences among these strong-willed civil
servants, together they dominated proceedings of the DRC and per-
formed an estimable service in the cause of rearmament. Despite his part


242 A man and an institution

in this effort, Warren Fisher, nearly a decade later, was among those who
felt the sting of criticism that Britain had not prepared earlier and more
comprehensively for war.^138 Although Hankey rejected the harsher
charges about Fisher, he did comment unfavorably about his colleague's
excessive interference with Britain's rearmament efforts.^139 Yet it is clear
that Hankey - whatever memories he may have held of struggles within
the DRC, the ministerial committees, and the Cabinet - exempted Fisher
from the substantive criticism which he directed against the' dead hand' of
'Treasury control,' which in its 'extravagant interpretation' had
'militated against the efficiency of our defences.'^140
Fisher's role at the Treasury is now far better understood than only a
few years ago, let alone 1943, and his contribution to rearmament - even
in this brief compass - cannot be disputed, even taking into account his
insistence upon curbing defence spending for economic reasons.^141
Ultimately, the Treasury Secretary, like his Cabinet counterpart, ex-
ercised influence, but neither could claim power.^142 Whether the
institution within which Fisher moved to influence the course of events
damaged Britain's war readiness is a more contentious matter: a long
succession of military commentaries advanced ' Treasury control' as the
culprit, and Hankey had no doubts; recent accounts, firmly grounded in
the records, incline against such a monocausal explanation.^143 On the
contrary, argues G. C. Peden, because 'Treasury control' 'forced
ministers and military men to come to decisions about priorities, and
thereby ensured that essential elements in Britain's defences were
completed first.'^144 Yet the point remains that the Treasury's exercise of
financial control over rearmament left next to no margin for error in the
choice of those priorities. The 'fourth arm of defence,' it appears, shed
constraints of fiscal orthodoxy all too slowly, and the nation paid a price in
the events of 1939-42.^145
While Sir Warren Fisher insisted that the Fighting Services could not
independently make the best use of Britain's financial resources,^146 in
other quarters - most prominently a small but vocal parliamentary group

- complaints were lodged against the co-ordinating mechanism supplied
    by the CID. Hankey was unable to persuade these Tory MPs that the
    higher organization of defence was all that it should be.^147 For several
    years Hankey fended off the suggestion that a full-time deputy at the CID
    would lighten his own burden. Several times mentioned as a possibility
    for such a post, the respected military commentator Basil Liddell Hart
    was dismayed by Hankey's failure to respond to proposals for improved
    defence planning, noting after a conversation in March 1935: 'He
    mentioned that he became Secretary of the C.I.D. at 34 and was now 58.
    This explains much - why a man of such alert mind and ideas is clearly, as
    I have noticed, becoming more complacent with things as they are.'^148


```
Hankey's last years 243
```
Liddell Hart concluded that the opposition to a Ministry of Defence came
from Hankey and the civil heads of the Fighting Services: 'A Minister of
Defence with a combined General Staff would be likely to impair their
present degree of authority.'^149
Hankey's defence of the status quo weakened when his former colleague
from the COS Committee, 'Boom' Trenchard, urged publicly that the
secretaryship of the Cabinet and the CID ought to be divided, with the
latter becoming a full-time post.^150 Written 'in sorrow but not in anger,'
Hankey's private reply described the suggestion as 'deplorable.' Yet as
press criticism of the status quo mounted in early 1936, not even his
defence of the defence organization could be sustained; a parliamentary
debate on 14 February forced Hankey to admit that changes would have
to be made - though he claimed to hold in reserve his own resignation if
those changes were too severe. Already he had warned the Cabinet about
the dangers inherent in establishing even a Minister of Defence, sans
ministry, because such a course would pose the dilemma of' dual control,
not only between the Prime Minister and the Minister of Defence, but
between the Minister of Defence and the Fighting Service Ministers.'^151
He acknowledged the unsatisfactory condition of the present planning for
' supplies in time of war' but contended that the cause of this deficiency
was external, a product of the now-abandoned Ten Year Rule.
Although in the past Hankey had voiced reservations concerning the
difficulties which a minister co-ordinating defence might have in Cabinet
with his Service colleagues, he capitulated to the appointment of a
minister as a defence deputy to the Prime Minister. He could hardly do
otherwise in view of Baldwin's feelings:

This [the appointment] was forced upon them [the Cabinet] if for no other reason
than by the P.M. saying he did not have adequate time to go properly into defence
questions. In ordinary times perhaps he could, but now that Defence has become
a major issue and a really close watch will be needed over the carrying out of the
programmes he can't do the job. So that settled the point.^152

And on that point Hankey finally lost his struggle to preserve the
Committee of Imperial Defence as the sole agency for the co-ordination
of Britain's defence planning. Yet the question arises whether Hankey,
having lost the battle, won the war, because the selection of Sir Thomas
Inskip for the position, an appointment widely criticized at the time, did
not place an experienced student of military affairs at Hankey's
shoulder.^153
Surely it is no coincidence that Hankey chose this time to strengthen
the organization of the CID through the appointment of a senior officer as
Deputy Secretary, noting laconically that such a post had 'existed for
some years after the war and was dropped for reasons of economy.' The
appointee, Colonel Hastings 'Pug' Ismay, did not assume the post until


244 A man and an institution

August 1936.^154 Another key CID appointment was that of Major L. C.
Hollis as a full-time Secretary to the Committee of Deputy Directors
(Planning), an action which strengthened the Joint Planning Committee
and accelerated the business of combined planning, so vital when war
came.^155 In these particulars, the 'flexible' CID structure which Hankey
had so long defended admitted of change, although that change has been
characterized as' conservative in intention and... equally so in effect.'^156
Clearly the Committee of Imperial Defence remained entirely Hankey's
type of organization as long as he continued in his post.
Nor did the structural changes in defence organization associated with
Inskip's appointment affect Hankey's own role in defence planning. The
role of the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defence was not cast in
independent terms, but he did not lack influence, and influence mattered
in defence planning.^157 True that Inskip was chosen by Chamberlain to
'involve us in no fresh perplexities,'^158 but he did join in the preparation
of the country for war. Particularly consequential was his challenge to the
traditional strategic doctrine of the Air Staff which held that because
victory lay only in air attack, construction of heavy bombers mattered
above all else. Countering that ' German bombers... could be better
destroyed over Britain by a fighter force than by bombing her aerodromes
and factories,' Inskip carried in the Cabinet his proposal that the RAF
fighter force should be strengthened and provided with full reserves.^159
Thus Scheme ' K,' in whose development Inskip was directly involved,
gave priority in air rearmament to the defence, a trend which intensified
in the months before the outbreak of war. Generally, Inskip worked
closely with the new Prime Minister, Chamberlain, and his successor as
Chancellor, Simon, in the last major pre-war review of Britain's defence
preparations in the winter of 1937-8, a review in which the Treasury
again exerted its force, for fear that, in Fisher's words, 'we are rapidly
drifting into financial chaos and are in danger of undermining ourselves
before the Boche feels it desirable to move.'^160 This review assured that
priority went to provision against air and sea attack, which accorded with
Hankey's own predilection to place island and imperial defence above
military support for Britain's allies on the continent.^161 Inskip's contri-
bution may best be understood as an extension of 'Treasury control'
within Whitehall Gardens, but Hankey took care not to neglect his
ministerial associate, because Inskip was susceptible to influence, and he
possessed Chamberlain's confidence.^162
Inskip personally caused Hankey no problems - the Cabinet Secretary
saw himself and the minister as ' twin brothers' - although the relation-
ship imposed' a lot of rather thankless and unremunerative work' on him,
in connection with Inskip's parliamentary responsibilities. On balance,
however, Hankey concluded that 'the Government... are not doing


Hankey's last years 245

enough even now and not doing it quick enough/^163 and he speculated
with less than total certainty that had he been left in charge of the DRC,
the rearmament program might have been moved along more quickly. To
the end, the defence re-organization of 1936 remained no more than a
'marriage of convenience': his heart and mind remained of the old
persuasion.
Nor did Hankey part company with the geo-political considerations
which marked his inter-war views; if anything, the developments of the
1930s confirmed his assumptions. All along he had viewed the League of
Nations as a thin and undependable reed, unable to sustain the fervid
hopes of its partisans. Too much could not be asked of that body, but in
1935 the British government attempted to use League sanctions in order
to curb Mussolini's territorial designs upon Abyssinia. The Cabinet
Secretary used his influence directly upon the new Foreign Secretary,
Samuel Hoare, as a full diary entry reveals:

Hoare said this abandoning the sanctions would be letting down the League.
Public opinion would not stand it. I disagreed. All the official world, outside the
F.O. (and many within it) are against sanctions, and especially the oil sanction.
Most intelligent people outside that I had met felt the same. He said, in effect, that
the official world had 'cold feet' about it.
I replied in effect that we knew the facts.

... Hoare said my policy was really a confession that we were not prepared to
support the League. We might as well scrap it at once. That was what my policy
came to.
I said 'No'. I have never been opposed to the League. I regarded it as a great
organ of conciliation, with immense possibilities for the future. We ought to keep
it. But with four of the seven Great Powers outside, and with the only effective one
of the three remaining Powers (France) lukewarm we ought not push economic
sanctions to the point where force might be invoked. It was too dangerous. And it
was making the League an instrument of war instead of an instrument of peace.^164

Hankey's position was consistent if narrow: his 'support' for the League
was predicated upon a drastically altered Covenant, as his thoughts on
Britain's defence posture in mid-1936 make unequivocal:

Articles 10 and 16 must be put into cold storage outside these limits [a purely
defensive commitment on behalf of France, Belgium, and Holland], so far as we
are concerned. There they are likely to remain, for the reason that men and
women are unwilling to incur the horrors and dangers and exhaustion of modern
warfare except for the immediate defence of their own country.^165

###### Such a view, strongly put to the Foreign Secretary in November 1935,

###### may have contributed to Hoare's change of face, which led him in short

###### order to conclude his ill-fated pact with Pierre Laval.

###### In so advising the Foreign Secretary, Hankey represented the views of

###### the COS, who had earlier held that while Britain was sufficiently strong to

###### prevail in the Mediterranean, losses would result from the Fleet's lack of


```
246 A man and an institution
```
full preparation for such warfare; further, they viewed reaction abroad,
particularly in the Far East, as a complicating factor which also dictated a
refusal to challenge Mussolini.^166 Following HMG's implementation of
such advice, Chatfield, the First Sea Lord, pithily reflected the view held
throughout military circles: 'Collective security showed itself to be a
heavenly dream, as it was the British sailor's nightmare.'^167 Hankey was at
home amidst such sentiments, but he could not have been more off the
mark in his assertion that public opinion would sanction Britain's scuttle
from a pro-League stance; in fact his notion that public opinion followed
that of the' official world' indicated how out of touch Hankey had become,
although the politicians who had recently won an election fared no better.
However, in Hankey's case, there is a rare cynicism in his assertion that
' the Government had won the election decisively. They no longer had to
angle for votes from the left wing and could do what they wished.'^168
Within a month Hoare lost the Foreign Office because in good measure he
could not do as they wished - their electoral pledges on behalf of what
appeared a genuine League policy had been taken seriously.^169 Though
the direct weight of 'public opinion' precipitating Hoare's resignation
may have been exaggerated - ironically by the government and Hoare
himself- Conservative MPs realized that their commitment to collective
security could not be casually abandoned.^170
It must be remarked that in the context of HMG's pro-League
statements in 1935, Hankey deluded himself in thinking that he was ' pro-
League': in fact he referred to a very different League of conciliation,
shorn of the automatic sanctions which from a military perspective he
greatly feared.^171 The supreme irony remains that the actions of Hankey,
his military cohorts and the British government helped to maim the ailing
but real League of Nations, whatever their claims to uphold it. It may be
argued that a long-term consequence of the Hoare-Laval Pact was to
foster the very notion of Britain's irresoluteness and weakness which the
government hoped to overcome; ultimately Hitler's belief that Britain
would not defend any interests save her own influenced his attack upon
Poland, bringing about the Second World War. Whether or not a true
collectivist policy, organized through the League in 1935, might have
discouraged the dictators from their piece-meal acquisitions of 1935-9
cannot be settled; indeed the question serves as an interpretative
watershed for the historian of Britain, and Europe, in those years. Yet one
matter is clear: Britain's leaders, civilian and military, never gave the
collectivist policy a chance to succeed. If that be a failing, Sir Maurice
Hankey embodied the flaw.

Since Britain's leaders had no illusions - in their own eyes - about the
viability of a League policy, their determination to secure more effective


```
Hankey's last years 247
```
means of rearmament mattered above all else; until that time, they were
intent upon avoiding conflict before Britain's defences were in place.
Hankey himself put a fine edge to that sentiment in April 1936: 'The
essential thing is to stave off war and to strengthen ourselves in case one
day we can stave it off no longer - which God forbid.'^172 The effort, as we
have seen, was bounded by the structure of 'defence by committee':
questions were raised particularly about the proliferation of CID
committees in the years of rearmament,^173 but as late as May 1938 Hankey
insisted that only through such committee work could ' the large mass of
inter-Departmental business on which principles, policy, plans and
preparation for war ... be settled.'^174
Yet confusion was engendered by the creation of a number of senior ad
hoc committees: with the establishment in early 1937 of a standing
ministerial committee designated as a CID Sub-Committee on Defence
Plans (Policy), there existed three such top-level committees, namely the
CID, the DPRC - concerned mainly with the supply question - and the
DP (P). In the judgment of the official historian, 'all, to some degree,
were independent of each other, and yet dealing with defence questions
with no clear line of demarcation between them. There was a good deal of
overlap, and one committee took work which more properly belonged to
another.'^175 The conclusion cannot be avoided that with duplication of
effort came loss of time. A further question remains: had a monolithic
structure been forged, could Britain's pursuit of rearmament have
assumed a heightened tempo? In view of recent scholarship examining
the external constraints to which the Treasury as an institution and the
Cabinet as a political body answered, defence organization does not
appear as a consequential restraint upon rearmament. If responsibility be
personalized for what can be called Britain's 'grand strategy' in these
years, then Neville Chamberlain occupies center-stage no less than he did
in the conduct of foreign affairs after becoming Prime Minister.^176
Hankey recognized that the dictators were rearming ' ohne hast und ohne
rast,'^177 but a democracy moved by consensus no less than by committee.
Sufficient arms would not be in hand until 1939, and nothing in the
interim should detract from realization of rearmament programs. Thus
the COS feared above all the simultaneous 'hostility, open or veiled, of
Japan in the Far East, Germany in the West and any power on the main
line of communication between the two'; further, they could not foresee
the time when Britain's defence forces would be sufficiently strong 'to
safeguard our trade, territory and vital interests against Germany, Italy
and Japan at the same time.'^178 These fears define the strategic context for
appeasement, but however defensible the design, its execution proved to
be a frustrating if not humiliating experience, particularly for the Foreign
Office - which accepted the strategy.^179 Nonetheless, such a rare success


###### 248 A man and an institution

###### in curbing belligerent acts as occurred at the Nyon Conference in

###### September 1937 served to intensify the frustration felt in circles within

###### agreed with the Prime Minister's quest for peace. The two had not grown

###### close together in the brief direct association, but the mutual determi-

###### the likely outcome of a war fought before Britain was fully prepared.^193

###### Hankey does not stand in the ranks of the 'appeasers' round the premier,

###### designed to disguise the inability of British arms yet to sustain any other

###### foreign policy. Hankey conciliated from a conviction of weakness rather

###### than a sense of mission, although no one had labored harder than he to

###### overcome defence deficiencies.

###### in short order made a successful transition to conditions of total war in

###### from apportioning credit, alone 'the name of Sir Maurice (later Lord)

###### Hankey would spring to most minds.'^194 Quite rightly, Hankey's

###### Specifically, did the hardening of his views adversely affect his contri-

###### bution, because his biographer detects in Hankey 'severe physical and

###### mental strain... weakening] his normally limitless tact and patience' in

###### his last several years in office?^195 Perhaps more tact would have yielded

###### better results, but British rearmament was slowed by factors over which

###### Hankey, and indeed the defence organization, had little if any control.

Indeed, the damage from Hankey's hardening mental cast was visited
upon his close associates and himself, above all else. The most regrettable
product of Hankey's strain was a quarrel with Winston Churchill, for
which Hankey was to pay heavily, as Churchill slowly but surely eased
him out of ministerial office in his war-time regime. Over the years, the
two had maintained correct if not cordial relations: however, Churchill's
pursuit of economies in the Fighting Services during his term at the
Treasury had taken their toll not only of the Estimates but as well of
Hankey's forbearance.^196 Then too Churchill had played a leading role
in giving final form to the Ten Year Rule, which complicated Hankey's
subsequent official life enormously. In the 1930s, Hankey recollected
Churchill's 'special responsibility' for what was 'perhaps the root cause
of our accumulation of deficiencies.'^197 Yet Churchill was by this time
becoming a leading critic of the government's defence measures, an irony
which did not amuse those who had formerly wrestled with his
formidable presence at the Treasury. In 1936, Churchill's persistent
criticism of the Baldwin administration's response to German aircraft
production had raised the question whether secret papers should
continue to be given to him in his capacity as a member of the CID Sub-
Committee on Air Defence Research. Hankey attempted to finesse the
question, and as a result Churchill did not realize how hard pressed
Hankey, Swinton, the Air Minister, and Inskip were in their dealings
with him.^198 The problem was compounded by their realization that
generally in the British air effort' the need for push and drive... has not
penetrated very far below those who hold immediate responsibility.'^199
Another complication was a continuing flow of Air Stafif information to
Churchill, supplemented by the sources cultivated by Desmond Morton,
Chairman of the Economic Intelligence Centre.^200
From any perspective, the air imbalance worsened early in 1937, and
Churchill and Hankey discussed these developments in a strained
conversation: Hankey was irritated by Churchill's threat to circulate
among his own ' friends' the latest information which had come his way,
if he were not given the Air Staffs reaction to those figures. In fact the Air
Staff disputed Churchill's conclusions, but the Cabinet Secretary did not
want to share with Churchill' specially secret information' which the Air
Staff had used to refute his claims. Churchill held his fire for the moment,
although he informed Hankey - for the second time in less than a year^201 -
that he possessed 'no separate source of information,' which the latter
had inquired about.
Churchill took umbrage at the proposed visit of German Air General
Milch and a deputation, scheduled for the autumn of 1937. Layers of
intrigue envelop this episode - Vansittart suspected that Milch had in the


###### 252 A man and an institution

###### past done his best to lull his British informants into a false sense of

###### security^202 - but Churchill derided the' sham show' mounted for Milch's

###### benefit. In an appeal addressed to Hankey, he included a letter from ' a

###### high Staff officer of the RAF' who had written of the prospects for the

###### visit in scathing terms.^203 Although Hankey did not dispute Churchill's

###### 'pretty shrewd knowledge of the situation,' he was angered by

###### Churchill's access to such information, cleverly supplemented by his

###### reference to Hankey's actions in the Great War: ' I remember how you

###### played an essential part in saving the country over the convoy system, and

###### how when young officers came to you and told you the truth, against

###### Service rules, you saw that the seed did not fall on stony ground.'^204

###### Registering his belief that ' a most shocking state of affairs' operated in

###### the Air Force, Churchill sought to enlist the CID Secretary in remedial

###### action:' you have a great responsibility - perhaps on the whole second to

###### none - and therefore I leave the matter for the moment in your hands.'

###### Hankey summarily rejected Churchill's appeal and denounced his

###### approach as 'all wrong, that the thing is infectious, and subversive to

###### discipline and that the damage done to the Services far outweighs any

###### advantage that might accrue.' In this instance, he intimated, the

###### 'unofficial' route was contaminated by Churchill's involvement: 'It

###### shocks me not a little that high Officers in disciplined Forces should be in

###### direct communication with a leading Statesman who, though notoriously

###### patriotic beyond criticism, is nevertheless in popular estimation regarded

###### as a critic of the Departments under whom these Officers serve.' Nor did

###### Hankey need a reminder of his own responsibilities, and he declined to

###### discuss the substantive matters raised by Churchill without ministerial

###### authority. While he hoped to retain Churchill's 'goodwill,' his letter

###### impresses as brusque, even brutal, and Churchill's succinct termination

###### of the correspondence was merited:' I certainly did not expect to receive

###### from you a lengthy lecture when I went out of my way to give you, in strict

###### confidence, information in the public interest.' The point of the exchange

###### is not whether the Air Staff or Churchill's network was better informed

###### about the actual dimensions of German air construction,^205 but rather

###### why had Hankey committed what his biographer views as ' perhaps his

###### worst tactical error'? As a rule, he burned no bridges to former ministers

###### and sought no unnecessary enemies, especially among unquestioned

###### patriots. Why the unwise and damaging outburst, when Hankey had so

###### long exercised restraint? The action was wholly out of character,^206 and it

###### is explicable only in terms of Hankey's exhaustion from the ever-

###### accumulating weight of duty; his patience with criticism had worn thin

###### and, confident of Churchill's errant ways, Hankey attacked by way of

###### compensation for all the problems Churchill had posed over the years.

###### His lapse was regrettable, but it may well have been necessary.


```
Hankey's last years 253
```
Of far less consequence to Hankey's future was a needless quarrel with
Lawrence Burgis, his Private Secretary of many years' standing, which
serves to confirm Hankey's exhaustion. The details of this rupture are not
germane,^207 and although Hankey himself protested that 'there are
always two sides to every question,' opinion within the Cabinet Office
swung against Hankey's harsh handling of a trivial dispute; Henry
Pownall related the dispute to his general concern about Hankey: 'The
fact is I suppose he's showing the strain of all his many years of hard work
and his nerves are beginning to jangle.'^208 The strain, we have witnessed,
was cumulative, but in his last months Hankey encountered the agonizing
prospect that Chamberlain's search for an agreement with the dictators -
if successful - might 'weaken, and perhaps destroy, his efforts in the
rearmament field.'^209 Perhaps it was this uncertainty that two projects
which he wholeheartedly supported might serve to cancel out each other
which haunted Hankey, although there is no direct evidence. Nonethe-
less, it is well to keep in mind that the complexities of the last three years
of peace were in some ways harder to bear than the simplicities of war, a
point made by Hankey's CID deputy 'Pug' Ismay: 'The... years from
1936 to 1939 were more difficult and anxious than the three years of
almost uninterrupted disaster which followed them.'^210 Hankey left
Whitehall Gardens uncertain that Britain would prevail, and that - above
all other uncertainties - weighed heavily upon him.

In his understandable preoccupation with defence, the administration of
Cabinet business did not much concern Hankey in those years, although
he continued to take the minutes of all Cabinet meetings, and he involved
himself with some Cabinet committee work as well. He worked within the
system which had evolved over the years, adapting procedures to suit the
style of the incumbent premier: when Baldwin took over in 1935, the
Cabinet Minutes regained some substance, occasionally taking the form
of the attribution of individual views. The Cabinet Secretary felt free to
maintain something approaching a verbatim record of Cabinet deliber-
ations in vital matters, for example the discussion prior to Hoare's
resignation in December 1935. In informing the Prime Minister about
the existence of such a record, Hankey noted that only one copy existed,
partly in his own hand - the ministerial comments bearing upon that
resignation Hankey had not given to a typist - and that he proposed to
keep it, under seal, with the Cabinet archives. Curiously, the minute was
examined on one occasion before the entire file of Cabinet Minutes was
sent to the Public Record Office: in June 1946, the Cabinet Secretary,
Norman Brook, had some reason to examine it, and he then replaced it in
a cover marked ' TOP SECRET - To be opened personally by ,'
filling in 'The Secretary of the Cabinet.'^211


###### 254 ^ man and an institution

###### Nor did the circulation of Cabinet papers prove in Hankey's last years

###### to be the problem it once had been. Some modifications were made in the

###### lists of those to whom certain categories of documents were circulated,

###### but the matter was handled routinely. In April 1937 the Cabinet agreed to

###### the request of the new monarch, George VI, that copies of Cabinet

###### memoranda should be sent to the Duke of Gloucester, who would become

###### Regent in the event of George's death; copies of Cabinet Minutes and

###### Cabinet committee papers were excluded from the arrangement. How-

###### ever, the scheme represented an adaptation of arrangements made late in

###### the reign of George V to send a very limited selection of Foreign Office

###### and Dominions Office telegrams to the Prince of Wales and the Duke of

###### York. The old king had expressed ' the greatest misgivings' even about

###### that arrangement, maintaining that their duties did not include access to

###### such materials, but he had yielded.^212 When the Prince of Wales became

###### Edward VIII, his Secretary, Hardinge, likely was a party to the screening

###### of certain Foreign Office papers from him, on security grounds: allegedly

###### the action was taken because no staff accompanied him on his forays to

###### Fort Belvedere.^213

###### In the wake of Eden's resignation, complaints were voiced from

###### Buckingham Palace that communications had broken down between

###### George VI and his government; Hankey was chided by Hardinge, but he

###### quickly established that the Prime Minister's Office was the accepted

###### channel of communication. In fact, the blunder had occurred in the

##### King's staff, and nothing more was heard from Hardinge.^214 To the end,

###### Hankey was not caught in a procedural faux pas. Greater problems were

###### posed by documents emanating from the Committee of Imperial

###### Defence, whose efforts could not always be made to comport with the five

###### days' notice required for papers brought before the Cabinet. Chamber-

###### lain was anxious that ministers be given ample opportunity to consider all

###### papers, and he pressed the CID to conform.^215 He also reminded the

###### Cabinet that most Cabinet and CID papers ought not be shown to minor

###### government officials, although in some cases, ministers outside the

###### Cabinet and senior Service advisers might be shown, at ministerial

###### discretion, such specially secret papers as were relevant to their tasks,

###### always under strict 'Lock and Key' protection.^216

###### At this time, the Cabinet Secretariat established new guidelines for the

###### 'Lock and Key' category; Howorth expressed pleasure that he would no

###### longer have to 'discriminate between documents that are "Secret" and

###### those that are "Most Secret." '^217 The latter category could be abolished,

###### replaced by the exhortation, ' SECRET - to be kept under lock and key,'

###### which at least provided a functional distinction easily understood by all.

###### Cabinet papers were placed in the ' Lock and Key' category in all cases

###### where 'it is thought that access to them should be strictly confined to


```
Hankey^3 s last years 255
```
Cabinet Ministers, their junior Ministers, and their responsible Expert
Advisers.' As a matter of course, these papers were to be denied to all
others, save the exceptional case noted by the Prime Minister. Ministerial
responsibility was provided for through the stipulation that 'Lock and
Key' papers were to be placed as well in sealed envelopes, to be opened
only by the person to whom they were addressed. The Secretariat advised
that more Cabinet papers would require special handling, but they strove
to insure that such treatment was not commonplace; the approval of a
Deputy Secretary was required for the classification.^218
These changes, at the Prime Minister's behest, were to be included in
the materials relating to Cabinet procedure which were circulated to
successor governments. Of interest in that package, which we have
reviewed, was the stipulation in its revised version of 1936 of the need to
consult the Prime Minister prior to the circulation of a Cabinet
document, although the practice was still not universally honored. Hankey
also included a reference to the Cabinet decision concerning the custody
of Cabinet papers, spelling out the duty of ministers to return' all Cabinet
Conclusions and Papers issued to them while in office' upon vacating
office. The Cabinet Office also had a hand in defeating a proposal that
junior ministers be given access to Foreign Office telegrams, 'on the
ground that without such means of keeping themselves informed it was
difficult for ... those not in the Cabinet to understand and defend
government policy.'^219 Although the Foreign Secretary was so inclined,
Howorth looked askance at the numbers involved, more than two dozen,
and he thought that their inexperience with such documents would lead
to problems; Hankey was even more blunt in warning the Prime
Minister: 'I think that it is a most dangerous proposal, calculated
immensely to increase the risk of leakage. If it would be dangerous to-day,
it would be immensely more so in the case of a new and inexperienced
government.'^220 Chamberlain accepted Hankey's view, and although
Halifax pressed for reconsideration, Hankey prevailed, surely a measure
of the strength of his position as the custodian'of Cabinet secrecy.
Under Baldwin and Chamberlain, the National Government had
moved towards a more systematic organization of Cabinet committees, a
method of dealing with Cabinet business which has since become
commonplace. In addition to the two committees which had taken their
lead from the Prime Minister, the CID and the Economic Advisory
Council, the premier associated himself with the work of about a half-
dozen others, which began to acquire the look of permanence. In fact,
prior to MacDonald's resignation in 1935, no Cabinet committee had
been continued from one administration to another, for reasons advanced
by S. S. Wilson:


```
256 A man and an institution
```
each administration formed its own Committee structure to meet its own
problems and methods of work. The problems, in fact, were not markedly
different, and each administration set up committees on subjects such as
agriculture, housing, unemployment, and various aspects of foreign affairs, but
the membership and terms of reference differed, no doubt with the intention that
a wholly fresh approach would be made.^221

By the latter part of the decade, among a score of Cabinet committees, five
had emerged as standing bodies, whose meetings were generally presided
over by the Prime Minister: the work of three - Foreign Policy, Defence
Plans (Policy) and Defence Policy and Requirements (the last could
report either to the Cabinet or to the CID) - was related to the threat to
peace; another two - National Expenditures and General Purposes^222 -
had developed for other reasons. It is probable that their standing status
resulted from the continuity supplied by National Government, regard-
less of the premier. The role of the committee system within Cabinet
government in the years before 1939 remains generally an unanswered
question, except for those concerned with rearmament. No 'theory'
underlay developments in these years, although in practice movement
towards a permanent committee structure had occurred.
The work of the Committee of Imperial Defence we are acquainted
with; as for the Economic Advisory Council, far less need be said,
although its special status as a Prime Minister's committee dictates some
attention to its development during the 1930s. Council committees were
of three types: the two standing committees dealt with two areas for
which the Council bore responsibility, namely Economic Information
and Scientific Research. The former submitted, at two to three month
intervals, 'a report on the economic situation,' drafted by the few civil
servants attached to the Council. In the scientific area, there were
specialist standing committees and ad hoc groups which investigated
special problems, submitted reports, and passed out of existence. The
members of the two main committees were drawn almost exclusively
from the ranks of the Council, which numbered five ministers, including
the premier, and fourteen ' outsiders' chosen by the Prime Minister for
their expert knowledge in industry, economics, or science; others could
be co-opted to sit on the specialist standing committees of the ad hoc
bodies. The Economic Advisory Council remained an advisory body; any
action arising from its activities was undertaken on the recommendation
of the Cabinet.^223
This fairly rigid structure dated from the re-organization of 1930, and
later in the decade the recognition dawned that the reform had been
misconceived: in June 1937 the Prime Minister announced his intention
to review the EAC's work, and nearly a year later a Draft Report criticized
the 'fixed composition' of the Council. Since a wide range of topics were


```
Hankey's last years 257
```
discussed at its meetings, 'it inevitably happened that for any given
subject only a small number of the non-Governmental members of the
Council were in a position to express an informed opinion,' from which
deficiency arose their disillusionment. Yet the idea itself had proved
wrong:
The change in the title of the body, and, in particular, the use of the term
' Council', appeared to imply that the body possessed more than merely advisory
functions. The impression so created was definitely misleading, was harmful to
the organisation in its efforts to establish and maintain close relations with the
Government Departments with which its work brought it into contact.^224
Curiously, the National Government had disengaged from the Council
years earlier - for all the fact that MacDonald had presided over the
reform - and that body had not met since 1931. The two standing
committees and the ad hoc groups were credited with some successes, and
the Draft Report did not question the potential value of a body' specially
adapted to consider and advise on economic and scientific subjects.^5 Yet
the authors could only advise that the Council be remodelled along lines
originally laid down for the Committee of Civil Research in 1925, even to
the resumption of the designation, 'which has the double merit of being
both accurate and descriptive.' In embracing the hoary analogy to the
Committee of Imperial Defence, despite the substantial differences
between military and economic organization clearly pointed out in 1930,
the Draft Report must rank as one of the least imaginative government
documents of the decade.
Seemingly it was greeted with an appropriate governmental yawn, and
even a year later the task of re-organization had a low priority.^225 Events
hung fire until the outbreak of war, at which time the position of the
Economic Advisory Council was described as 'somewhat nebulous.'^226
No area of government organization for which Hankey held a measure of
responsibility - the EAC remained within the Cabinet Office - had
proved more 'nebulous' and generally ineffective than this body.
As Hankey had observed his sixtieth birthday in April 1937, the
question of his retirement from the Cabinet Secretariat came to the fore.
He was personally concerned for the financial welfare of his family and
scouted about for what he characterized as 'gilt-edged directorships,'
among which the principal plum was a Director's post on the Suez Canal
Company, in the gift of the Prime Minister. At Easter 1938, he informed
Neville Chamberlain that he would like to have it; he did not have to
acknowledge that the major reason had been put by his predecessor at
£5000 per annum in fees. The Prime Minister asked for some time to
think the matter over,^227 whether on personal grounds or institutional:
the latter involved the question of Hankey's successor, or successors, on
the three bodies which he served - the Cabinet Secretariat, the


```
258 A man and an institution
```
Committee of Imperial Defence, and the Privy Council. Hankey himself
thought it advantageous to combine the two secretaryships, because
defence matters would receive first priority at the Cabinet;^228 however,
the appointment of Inskip in 1936 undercut the contention that defence
matters as a whole would not gain Cabinet scrutiny without the presence
of the CID Secretary. Complicating the succession was Hankey's virtual
sinecure post as Clerk to the Privy Council, with the rationale that in time
of grave crisis a single figure could move from Cabinet to Privy
Council, there apparently to secure Orders in Council; in calmer
times, Hankey relied on an assistant to tend to the Council's
ceremonial work. While George V, for example, recognized Hankey's
claim to combine the positions, already in 1927 the King's Private
Secretary looked to a post-Hankey separation of the Clerkship from the
other posts and even thought that' if anything were to happen to Hankey
it is possible that a Civil Servant would become Secretary of the Cabinet,
and a Naval or Military Officer Secretary of the Defence Committee.'^229
Such a division of labors during Hankey's absence in 1934 fueled
speculation that no one individual would succeed him; a year later, a
Military Assistant Secretary, Col. Henry Pownall, noted:' I don't believe
there are insuperable difficulties in the way of splitting Hankey's job
provided that the Secretary of the CID was on a level with the Secretary
to the Cabinet and charged with the duty of taking all Cabinet meetings at
which defence, and cognate questions, were considered.'^230 With pres-
sures mounting upon the office in subsequent years, Hankey's military
deputy at the CID noted the conflict of business between that body and
the Cabinet as too much for any one man; he also reflected that the two
posts called for very different training and experience, and, as a result:
It would be difficult to find a soldier who would make a good Secretary of the
Cabinet, and equally difficult to find a civilian who would make a good Secretary
of the Committee of Imperial Defence and the Chiefs of Staff Committee. As The
Times put it: 'Hankey's versatility cannot become a heritable organisation.'^231
Ismay's comments make it clear that Hankey could no longer spend most
of his energies on the CID, as was his preference, although it is difficult to
understand why Ismay himself could not take up the slack - assuming
Hankey permitted it.
While Chamberlain deliberated, Hankey learned that others had
already declared an interest in the succession, advancing a candidate, the
Treasury official Edward Bridges, who was urged upon the Prime
Minister by his superior, Sir Warren Fisher - as Head of the Civil
Service, he had a direct interest - and by Sir Horace Wilson, nominally
Chief Industrial Adviser but a close confidant of the premier. Bridges had
impressed everyone, including Chamberlain, with whom he had come
into contact since becoming involved in the rearmament effort in 1934;^232


```
Hankey's last years 259
```
thus his candidacy appears well chosen, because of his Service experience
and his undoubted grasp of the fiscal dimensions of defence problems.
Confronted with a plausible nominee, Hankey's difficulties were com-
pounded because the Cabinet Secretary could not yet advance any one
individual from his own organization: Ismay didn't wish to combine the
secretaryships, although he suggested a division of Cabinet labors, with
the Secretary taking defence, foreign policy, imperial and colonial
matters, and a deputy taking the civilian work. Hankey did not favor the
idea, nor apparently did anyone else in authority.^233 Slow off the mark -
unusual for Hankey - the Secretary sought to persuade his former CID
associate, now Major-General Henry Pownall, to stand for the combined
posts he held, appealing to Fisher to proceed no further until Pownall had
time to reflect. Although reluctant to stand, the latter agreed provided
that Ismay continued to decline and then 'if the position can be held for
the Services only by my taking it.'^234 However, Ismay agreed to stand
without re-organization, and Pownall agreed that Hankey could use his
name 'as a last reserve' if Ismay's proved unacceptable.
The Cabinet Secretary prepared for battle, spelling out the qualifi-
cations of both men by way of training and service within the Secretariat
so as to assure the Prime Minister 'whichever you choose I am certain
that you will never regret it.'^235 He noted his own consternation that the
Treasury should now contravene an understanding struck years ago that
the post should go to a Service Officer, provided a suitable candidate
could be found; now he offered two. There were substantive concerns
which favored a combined post, including the fact that' the manipulative
services' of the Secretariat and CID were presently pooled in such a way
that the Cabinet Office functioned as a team, thus making it possible for
the Cabinet Secretary to render to the Prime Minister 'innumerable
small and almost unnoticed services that make all the difference in the
world between prompt despatch of business and dangerous delay.'
Hankey also argued that a Secretary bred in the CID was better versed
than a civilian counterpart for dealing with the mechanism of war
government, since he spoke 'the same language' as the Service Staffs:
' They have to entrust him with their war plans - the greatest secret they
possess - and with much important drafting, both in peace and war.
Human nature is such that they will give their confidence more
unreservedly to one who has been brought up in the same traditions and
under the same system as themselves.' In summarizing his plea, Hankey
reminded Chamberlain that 'the thunderclouds of war are only just over
the horizon,' which heightened the need for an experienced hand in
military matters. While the invocation of war may not have appealed to a
man who was dedicated to its avoidance, Hankey's discussion of the
issues was principled and his enumeration of priorities reasonable, with


###### 260 A man and an institution

###### only minor barbs directed at the lack of Treasury planning for the civilian

###### dimension of warfare, by way of contrast to the CID's 'encyclopaedic

###### knowledge of the Government machine... that certainly is not equalled

###### elsewhere.'^236

###### On the following day, Chamberlain informed Hankey that he had

###### gained the coveted directorship, an 'appointment... welcome in all

###### quarters.' The Cabinet Secretary pressed the Prime Minister for a

###### conversation on the matter of the succession,' as there were some things

###### easier said than written.' Although Chamberlain agreed not to take a

###### decision until he had heard Hankey out, for the next few days Hankey was

###### invalided - his first such absence from Whitehall in six years. Upon

###### returning on 16 May, Hankey locked horns with Horace Wilson, who

###### announced the premier's displeasure with his lobbying in military circles

###### and intimated, according to Hankey, that the directorship was jeop-

###### ardized: Hankey saw 'a bluff and a blackmail' in Wilson's words, and he

###### privately rejected any notion that his agreement could be bought.^237 Thus

###### he carried high hopes into his meeting with Chamberlain on the 18th; for

###### an hour he spoke to the premier along lines which he had formulated in

###### advance. Although he may not have used all the arguments with which he

###### had, on paper, primed himself, the general tenor of his remarks was rather

###### more assertive than his earlier memorandum.^238 He contended that the

###### only departmental 'experience' that mattered came from within the

###### Cabinet Office, because the work was suigeneris and bore' no resemblance

###### to the work of an ordinary Government Department.' More personalized

###### was his remark that' a Treasury appointment would be a terrible slap in

###### the face for me, because he had been assured that his post was viewed as

###### ' one of the blue ribands of the Services' and would be retained by the

###### military. For this he claimed the authority of the Head of the Civil Service

###### and, as a result, 'if a Civil Servant is appointed I shall rightly be

###### considered in the Services as having " sold the pass."' Yet Fisher too had

###### a high stake in the choice, since earlier in the year he had failed to prevail

###### upon the Prime Minister to pass over Sir Alexander Cadogan as

###### Vansittart's successor at the Foreign Office; Fisher had gone so far as to

###### volunteer himself for the post, with a reduction in rank and loss of pay.^239

###### Whether or not Hankey was aware that the Head of the Civil Service

###### had recently lost a personnel recommendation, he did not forget Fisher's

###### earlier ' grab' at his own position, as he reminded Chamberlain of that

###### episode. Less tactfully, he criticized the Treasury, even if his remarks

###### were limited to the period since Chamberlain had moved to No. 10:' The

###### CID and Cabinet Office have always been regarded as neutral ground. It

###### would be a great mistake just now, when all the Services are rather

###### resentful of Treasury activities during the past year, to give any

###### impression that it has become a mere Annex to the Treasury.' The Prime

###### Minister replied that he would carefully consider Hankey's remarks,


```
Hankey's last years 261
```
although he added that he had in mind 'a compromise solution' but
would require time to work it out. For his part, Hankey had done all in his
power to secure the succession for Ismay or Pownall - and for the
Services; the exchange had not been a pleasant one for Hankey, who took
great pride in the operation which he had helped to create, because he
described the business to his son as' a frightful row.'^240 Chamberlain soon
announced his 'compromise,' and Hankey recorded the results in his
diary on 23 May:

Bridges — Secretary to Cabinet and Cabinet Office, which includes C.I.D. and
Economic Advisory Council.
Ismay - Secretary to C.I.D. and Secretary C.O.S. Ctee which Bridges
would attend only by invitation.
Howorth - Remains Deputy Secy, to Cabinet and becomes Clerk of the
Privy Council.
I at once expressed satisfaction and gratitude that Ismay becomes definitely
Secretary C.I.D. with improved status. Ismay is delighted. So is Howorth.

The origins of this ' compromise' are unknown, but the idea of divided
labors within the Cabinet Office had surfaced in a note Hankey had sent to
Warren Fisher on 10 May, in which Hankey had suggested his deputy,
Howorth, as Cabinet Secretary and Ismay as Secretary to the CID, with
an agreed succession to the Cabinet post, given Howorth's not too distant
retirement.^241 Hankey subsequently had resisted such a division of
responsibilities, but he may possibly have given Fisher room to maneuver
in advancing Bridges' name.
A ' compromise' the arrangement may well have been, but there seems
no doubt that Warren Fisher had gained the upper hand, although
Hankey had preserved a military presence at the CID. The two positions
were sundered - Hankey's warning notwithstanding - and the 'blue
riband' was lost to the Fighting Services; yet Ismay held full re-
sponsibilities for the CID, and Howorth had been better treated than
Hankey had foreseen.^242 That there was give-and-take in the three
appointments is altogether clear, but Hankey must still have feared the
possibility of excessive Treasury influence within the Cabinet Office.
Nonetheless, he put his best face to the changes, which in any case would
have been difficult to resist in view of the Prime Minister's accomo-
dation. To his son Robin he insisted that the major point at issue was
military leadership at the CID:' The Treasury was fighting for Bridges to
be Secretary to the Cabinet & C.I.D. So I have got my point... The
Prime Minister has met me very handsomely by this compromise.'^243 In a
reflective vein - though the process of rationalization must not be
forgotten - Hankey penned a valedictory to his own system:
I shall leave without any regret. For a long time I have been deliberately building
up a system which should replace me and the considerable (and excessive)


```
262 A man and an institution
```
authority I wielded - C.O.S. Ctee, J.P. [Joint Planning] Ctee, Minister for Co-
ordination &c &c. It all works admirably, but involves the head of the office in an
immense work of directing other people and reading their stuff, thus leaving less
time for the personal contributions I used to make so freely. It is a seven days a
week job to run the three jobs myself as I do - even with the considerable measure
of decentralisation I have already introduced...
Altogether the job is not quite what it was. I feel I have had the best of it, a long
innings and a unique experience that no-one else has ever had or ever will have
again. Moreover, everything that I have set out to do has been done - except that
the programmes are not yet complete owing to circumstances beyond my control,
though well under weigh.

Though this description of a near-unmanageable job ill comports with
Hankey's desire that Ismay should combine the two most daunting
functions, there does not seem to be any reason to question Hankey's
heavy load of responsibilities, which after all had taken its toll.
The timing of his resignation, now scheduled for the end of July,
possessed a symbolic importance, since it corresponded to the Cabinet
Office's evacuation of Whitehall Gardens and the demolition of the very
site on the ist of August: the elegant buildings were ripped down to make
space for what proved to be the massive but barren facade of the Main
Building of the Ministry of Defence. Henry Pownall, who had no doubts
that Hankey had lost his struggle with Warren Fisher, commenting that
Ismay 'will find himself in reality more under Bridges than he will like,'
saw the significance of the end of an era:

```
It is time he [Hankey] went and that others took his place. But his departure is the
turning over of a page of history on which his name is writ very large... the old
building and he go together. He always said he would not see the move. Its
disappearance, too, is sad for it has many and great associations. We won our
greatest war in history with Hankey's room as the seat of British and Empire
effort.^244
```
If there be an element of exaggeration in Pownall's tribute, there is no
more fit time for the words than the occasion of Hankey's retirement from
a position in which he had distinguished himself for nearly twenty-two
years. Although the departing Cabinet Secretary might not personally
have valued a remark made by Beatrice Webb in connection with her own
labors at the London School of Economics, surely it is applicable to his
career:' To be outgrown by the organisation you create is the ultimate test
of victory.'^245
When Neville Chamberlain announced Hankey's retirement and the
re-organization of the Cabinet Offices on i June 1938, he spelled out the
rationale: the Prime Minister thought it essential that the 'Permanent
Secretary to the Cabinet Offices' should function as Secretary to the
entire operation, including the Minister for the Co-ordination of
Defence, the CID and EAC, providing 'a link between the Cabinet and


###### Hankey's last years 263

###### the CID [on which he would sit ex-officio] which could not be divided.'

###### In this basic sense, Hankey's argument had prevailed, although not with

###### the results he had hoped for. Ismay would assume the actual secretarial

###### burdens of the CID and conduct the work of the COS Committee, 'a

###### purely military committee' whose business had lately increased mar-

###### kedly; Howorth would continue as Deputy Secretary to the Cabinet in

###### addition to his duties at the Privy Council.^246 The CID continued

###### Britain's preparations for war while Chamberlain pursued his chimera of

###### peace to Munich and beyond to bitter disappointment. As in the First

###### World War, the CID lost its standing with the advent of war and

###### Churchill's later becoming Minister of Defence; ePug' Ismay went on to

###### greater responsibilities which, for most observers, fully justified

###### Hankey's confidence. Yet for the structural change, there was no lack of

###### continuity between the peace-time military organization and the war

###### regime, whose organizational foundations had long been laid: 'When

###### Churchill at last achieved power he inherited a well-trained and, on the

###### whole, a smooth running system - largely devised by Hankey; and it was

###### Hankey's heir Ismay who persuaded him to leave well alone.'^247

###### To preside over the Cabinet Office, Chamberlain announced his choice

###### of Edward Bridges, whose work at the Treasury he praised; he reported

###### that' very careful soundings' had satisfied him that the re-organization

###### would receive the enthusiastic support of all concerned; his Chancellor of

###### the Exchequer observed that only the Treasury would be the poorer for

###### the change, since it would suffer the loss of Bridges' services.^248 Bridges

###### attended his first Cabinet meeting as Secretary-Designate on 20 July, in

###### company with Hankey in order to achieve 'continuity of practice in

###### Secretarial arrangements.'^249 After taking his first minutes, he com-

###### mented to Hankey that his prior attendance at Cabinet had ' made all the

###### difference in the world.' Hankey had also taken great pains to acquaint his

###### successor with the fabled War Book, now passed into Bridges' custody:' I

###### am very grateful to you for your tip that it might be necessary to do a lot of

###### work in stirring up Departments to do their side of the business.'^250 One

###### wonders if Hankey singled out the Treasury for particular attention.

###### In the meantime, Hankey had taken his own farewell: at the last

###### Cabinet meeting he attended as Secretary, Chamberlain paid generous

###### but not excessive tribute to the man who he thought could 'fairly be

###### called the creator of the modern Cabinet.' Hankey responded in an

###### understated fashion that ' he was so unused to speaking in the Cabinet

###### Room that he hardly knew the sound of his own voice there,' but - ever

###### the man of records - he recalled that he had taken the minutes of some

###### 1100 Cabinet meetings, 1700 including the War Cabinet. Serving the

###### Cabinet he regarded as 'the greatest privilege' ever afforded him, and he

###### confessed' admiration' and' affection' for the present government.^251 On


###### 264 A man and an institution

###### a subsequent occasion, a dinner given in his behalf, he showed more

###### humor than was his wont in countering the myth of his indispensability:

###### 'Prime Minister, I tell you that round about the Horse Guards Parade,

###### there are a hundred men who could take my place at a moment's notice,

###### but in Mr. Bridges, Colonel Ismay, Sir Rupert Howorth you have chosen

###### a perfect trinity.'^252 Nor could one deny that this 'trinity' served HMG

###### well in the grim years ahead.

###### The occasion was no time for Hankey to attempt to measure the

###### unprecedented influence which he wielded over a quarter-century, as the

###### link - institutionally and himself an institution - between Britain's

###### military leaders and their civilian counterparts. Yet such had been one of

his principal roles, which he himself had characterized only a few months

###### earlier, in words which ring true:

I cannot too strongly stress that my aim throughout has been not any advantage to

###### myself, but the public interest, and I believe that this is fully recognized by the

Chiefs of Staff and by Ministers. If the Chiefs of Staff saw in me a person who, by

###### his position and long experience, must have the ear of Ministers and who was

###### running policies contrary to their own or thwarting their policies, my relations

###### with them would be impossible. As it is, every Chief of Staff since the creation of

the Sub-Committee has treated me as a friend and confidant and has remained my

###### friend after his retirement.

That is the position you have got to get into over a term of years. You have got

###### to establish your position at both ends: that is to say, with your successive

###### Ministers and with your successive Chiefs of Staffs [sic]. You must get yourself

regarded and treated as one who is never out for himself or for his own policies, or
for anything but the public interest. As Secretary you will, of course, not have the

###### right of putting in a Minority Report, or of dissenting from what the Chiefs of

###### Staff advise: but, especially as time goes on, you will find your influence

###### constantly increasing. They will turn to you for advice, and as the draftsman of

###### their Reports... your influence must be considerable.^253

###### Though there has been reason in this account to question, on occasion,

###### the wisdom of Hankey's calculation of the public interest, there is no room

###### to doubt the integrity of his efforts in that cause.

###### In his administrative capacity, Hankey had observed from the outbreak

###### of the First World War until the very eve of the Second the workings of

###### Cabinet government more closely than had any other man: nor was he

###### only a chronicler of Cabinet proceedings, because it was he who had

###### forged the administrative machinery by which the modern Cabinet

###### works. Beyond the establishment of the Cabinet Secretariat, Sir Maurice

###### Hankey played a commanding role in the development of the modern

###### British Cabinet: the patterns of present-day Cabinet government emer-

###### ged during his tenure of office; some are only dimly recognizable - and

###### others simply cannot be found - in the Cabinets of the Victorian and

###### Edwardian periods. If to characterize Hankey as the creator of modern

###### Cabinet government is to exaggerate, to deny that he was ' present at the

###### creation' and for decades after is impossible.


###### Hankey's last years 265

###### Yet Cabinet government continues to unfold, and in that sense

###### Hankey's departure from Whitehall Gardens serves only to demarcate a

###### lengthy albeit important chapter in its history. There is no doubt that his

###### tenure of office constitutes the decisive period in the history of the

###### Cabinet Secretariat. Because of Hankey's unique melding of the roles of

###### record keeper, administrator, confidant, and military adviser, no other

###### civil servant could follow fully in his footsteps as Secretary to the

###### Cabinet: indeed, two of his successors sought to obliterate Hankey's

###### historical tracks, in the form of his own war memoirs; in so acting, they

###### sought to preserve that secrecy of Cabinet proceedings which Hankey

###### himself had done so much to bolster. Fortunately for those who value the

###### 'better book,' Bridges and Brook ultimately failed in that particular

###### attempt and, with Hankey, in the desire to hold Cabinet records inviolate.

###### Though Cabinet documents now are open for public scrutiny after a

###### period of thirty years, we can rest assured that Hankey's successors will

###### not leave behind the type of private materials which he collected, most

###### important a diary. Present-day accounts hold to a depiction of the

###### Cabinet Secretary as a quintessential civil servant, though likely

###### possessed of his own views and prejudices, yet in future we are likely to

###### learn nothing from that privileged source about the workings of Cabinet

###### government, because Hankey's successors feel differently about the

###### propriety of their recording such views. For this informed but unofficial

###### dimension, we will surely turn to ministerial accounts, by a strange twist

###### of fate now increasingly free of the fetters which Hankey's Secretariat laid

###### upon such accounts.

years, former ministers will be free to discuss most aspects of Cabinet
proceedings following the end of that Cabinet's tenure - as they have been
able to do, in effect, since the end of the Second World War. Subject to
certain restrictions, which in the main will lapse after fifteen years, former
ministers will continue to retain a formidable advantage in depicting their
own views of affairs of state before any other. That ' outsiders' should
operate at a remove of thirty years from events is consistent with the role
which the Cabinet Office plays as the protector of Cabinet secrecy.
Even following his own departure from Whitehall Gardens in 1938,
Hankey serves to focus a discussion of the custody of Cabinet secrecy: for
more than two decades, he remained hoist with the petard fashioned in his
own time, and his encounters with the Cabinet Office reveal the precepts
which his successors strove to enforce. In the long run, however, those
men did not prove as successful as Hankey in proscribing informed
ministerial accounts, and they had also to come to terms with the public's
claim of access to Cabinet records. Concurrently, the growing disrepair
of the Official Secrets Act handicapped their efforts to administer Cabinet
secrecy through its provisions. The matter of Cabinet secrecy remains a
contentious one, and our examination of the application of principles of
'closed' and 'open government' to Cabinet secrecy leads directly to the
present day; suffice it to remark here that the Cabinet Office has
throughout labored for the former.
Before engaging with that question, a few summary comments ought to
be offered about the administrative pattern developed after Bridges'
succession in August 1938. His tenure of office fell mainly within the war
years, during which time the volume of Cabinet Office work, the speed
with which it was conducted, and the size of the staff all increased
significantly, although there was ' no basic change in the organisation of
the Office as a committee machine.' Until the outbreak of war in
September 1939, Bridges made no changes in the basic procedures of the
Secretariat; he is credited with initiating moves to give the Cabinet Office
'a more professional appearance,'^1 but continuity characterized the
transition and survived even the shock of war.
Yet it ought not escape notice that the successive moves of the Cabinet
Office, first to private houses in Richmond Terrace and, after German air
attacks in 1940, to government buildings in Great George Street,
represent the attachment of the Secretariat to the greater governmental
bureaucracy centered in the Treasury. Its independence was not at issue,
but Bridges had risen to the post through the Civil Service, replacing a
man - an institution - who was versed in ministerial as well as
bureaucratic ways. Bridges could not assume Hankey's own commit-
ments along with his official responsibilities: he had yielded any direct
role in military affairs by agreeing to the division of Hankey's labors, but


###### 268 A man and an institution

he nonetheless inherited an advisory role in other matters which had long
been an aspect of the Cabinet Secretary's position.^2 Nor did Bridges shed

###### an advisory role with the succession of Winston Churchill, although

###### fragmentary evidence suggests that he was initially troubled in his

###### dealings with the new premier; confidence between the two soon

strengthened.^3

###### When Bridges stepped down in 1946, he was succeeded by his deputy,

###### Norman Brook, and during the latter years of his tenure the Cabinet

###### Office was most closely connected to the Treasury: from 1956 until

###### Brook's retirement six years later, the office was subsumed, and the

###### Cabinet Secretary served as a Joint Permanent Secretary at the Treasury

###### and as Head of the Civil Service. Apparently the purpose of this odd

###### arrangement was ad hominem, designed 'to keep Sir Norman Brook as

###### Secretary of the Cabinet, where the Government found his services

###### invaluable, while not denying him the position of Head of the Civil

###### Service which is accorded to the Permanent Secretary of the Treasury.'^4

###### As a result of pressures within the Treasury, in 1962 the association of the

###### Secretary to the Cabinet with that central department was terminated.

Presently the Cabinet Office stands institutionally independent, and the

###### Cabinet Secretary is commonly viewed as one of the two or three most

###### important civil servants, although the extent of his influence is heavily

veiled.^5

###### As to the style of operation of the Cabinet Secretariat, Bridges' major

design was to simplify the very complex structure over which Hankey had

###### presided. Ismay also contributed to the particular effort directed at the

defence domain, although he resisted Churchill's more radical approach.

###### Already at the outset of war, the CID had been absorbed into the War

###### Cabinet and its Secretariat transformed into the Military Section of the

###### Cabinet Secretariat.^6 Bridges himself allegedly remarked early in the

###### course of the war that the abolition of some two dozen CID committees

###### was the biggest blow which the enemy had to that date endured.^7 As a

###### corollary, Bridges sought to reduce paper work, particularly in connec-

tion with the minutes of the War Cabinet and its various sub-committees;

###### although the recollections of Lawrence Burgis on this point somewhat

###### distort Hankey's intention, a difference in style is apparent. In Hankey's

time, Burgis recalled,

```
we attributed remarks and arguments to individuals, which was not too difficult,
but the method was altered in World War II. The pros and cons of a problem were
```
###### stated in general terms and the conclusion or decision put in at the end. There

###### were exceptions to this, of course...

###### Bridges' instructions regarding minutes were as follows: - (a) brief (b) self-

###### contained (c) in the main, impersonal, and (d) to the full extent the discussion

###### allows - decisive.^8


The custody of Cabinet secrecy 269

```
Sir Edward Bridges himself maintained the minutes, limited to the War
Cabinet conclusion coupled with 'a brief explanatory summary.' These
were to be circulated to each member of the War Cabinet, to every
minister holding an office which immediately prior to the war was a
Cabinet post, to the Permanent Secretary to the Treasury and the
Permanent Under-Secretary at the Foreign Office; Bridges thought a
proposal to disseminate these materials more widely an ' elaboration...
likely to cause mistakes and oversights,' instead opting for a straightfor-
ward model.^9 In the early months of the war, some adjustments were
made, but the War Cabinet Secretariat certainly acted on well-prepared
lines in facilitating the flow of government business. During that conflict,
the War Cabinet Secretariat undertook a widening range of war-related
responsibilities, the product of 'the interdepartmental organisation
which it serves.' Such tasks account for the growth of staff from a handful
more than 200 in 1939 to nearly 600 by its end.^10
In functional terms, the abolition of the CID and the division of
Secretariat business into civil and military had led to a closer integration
of effort, Bridges observed in 1944:
```
```
Taking a broad view, the main duties performed by the Cabinet Secretariat may
be grouped into the following three classes:—
(1) normal secretarial duties for the Cabinet and its Committees;
(2) preparation of material and collation of information on matters affecting
several departments;
(3) duties involving correspondence.
This classification errs on the side of over-simplification, and each group of duties
tends to merge into the others.^11
```
The performance of duties in the first category Bridges thought justified
'by experience'; the second function was related to the war, although
Bridges cautiously foresaw that the Secretariat might increasingly be
used in ' the central preparation of memoranda on matters affecting a
number of Departments' in the domestic sphere. In words which echoed
what Hankey had long insisted upon in order to protect the Cabinet
Secretariat against departmental suspicions, Bridges advised that 'where
it is a question of work which is preparatory to the formulation of policy,
it is not enough for Departments to regard the Cabinet Secretariat as a
body which acts impartially between Departments. They must feel that
their own officers are taking their due share in the work.' For that reason,
a post-1939 innovation had witnessed the seconding of some thirty-one
permanent civil servants from their Departments to administrative
positions within the Secretariat, for periods of six months or longer.
Previously, only one Treasury official had been seconded at a time. Yet it
had not been possible to provide for 'the whole of the war expansion'


###### 270 A man and an institution

###### through the loan of permanent civil servants, and in the war years a

###### number of temporary appointments had been made at the Cabinet Office.

###### Bridges' third category represented another innovation, and the

###### Cabinet Secretary was especially cautious about its implications, because

###### during the war the Secretariat had acted on behalf of various committees

- which had consulted with concerned Departments - in corresponding

###### ' with persons or bodies, either in this country or overseas, who are not

###### responsible to (or the concern of) a single Departmental Minister.' Care

###### had to be taken, because constitutional doctrine held that responsibility

###### 'must be through Ministers, and cannot be shifted to the Cabinet

###### Committee system.' In other words, the exigencies of war had produced a

###### constitutional anomaly, and Bridges concluded that it would be un-

###### desirable that the Secretariat 'should at any time handle more than a

###### small volume of work of this character.' In exercising such restraint,

###### Bridges followed in his predecessor's cautious ways: his description of

###### Secretariat functions contained nothing of substance inconsistent with

###### the past organization of responsibilities in serving the Cabinet. If the

###### Cabinet Office had several times been physically relocated since Hankey's

###### retirement, the instutitional edifice which he had built remained intact:

###### the support structure for Cabinet government during war stood in place.

###### Hankey himself accepted a War Cabinet post under Chamberlain and

###### continued as a minister in the Churchill coalition: his dismissal from

###### office at the latter's hands in 1942 impresses as an ungenerous act, but his

###### dissent from Churchill's conduct of the war ensured a rupture.^12 Their

###### several disagreements are not at issue here; what matters for our account

###### is that Hankey's dismissal freed his energies to be applied to the long-

###### delayed completion of his First World War memoirs: by September 1943

###### he had written his successor to arrange an official 'vetting' of the

###### manuscript so that it might be published when the opportunity arose.

###### Soliciting any personal comments which Bridges might wish to offer,

###### Hankey sought 'approval for its publication subject to any amendments

###### that are necessary for the public interest.' Although the Cabinet

#### Secretary promised an expeditious response, five months passed until he

###### suggested that they talk over certain matters relating to Hankey's

###### memoirs.^13 Precisely what happened at that meeting appears to have gone

###### unrecorded - an odd failure on Hankey's part - but it is clear that the

###### brunt of Bridges' concern was with what he later described as the' efifect it

###### [the memoirs] would have on the confidential relationship between

###### Ministers and their official advisers.'^14 Since the door was not closed

###### entirely, Hankey spent some months in revising his memoirs in order to

###### meet the criticisms voiced by his successor: he noted that he had made

###### perhaps a hundred changes, although 'it is impossible to conceal the


```
The custody of Cabinet secrecy 271
```
intimate relations with my Chiefs, which are well known from their own
Memoirs and many other publications.'^15 Hankey reminded Bridges that
the Great War period had long been treated sui generis, with greater
latitude given to informed accounts.^16
Yet the Cabinet Secretary informed his predecessor that the omissions
and alterations had failed to remove ' in any way' the central objection to
publication, concluding that the publication of such a memoir would not
be in the public interest:

Your book exposes, often in great detail, the working of this relationship [between
Ministers and official advisers], and the extent and degree to which Ministers
were dependent on particular occasions on the help given by their officials. I fear
that publication of all this material would have a very unfortunate effect on the
relationship to Ministers, not only of your successors as Secretary of the Cabinet,
but also of the Permanent Heads of the great Departments, and also of the Civil
Servants who, in other capacities, stand in a specially trusted relationship to
Ministers.

On a second reading of the manuscript, Bridges had been troubled by the
use which Hankey had made of his diary: ' You extract from it the inner
histories of the formation of the Government and of strains and stresses
between Ministers and the Cabinet, besides of course a good deal of
operational and political information which was highly secret at the time.'
The existence of such a record, he argued, would impair the con-
temporary relationship between civil servants and ministers:

if your book were published it would make me personally self-conscious in my
dealings with the Cabinet, and it would make Ministers generally much more
chary of speaking freely to members of the Cabinet Secretariat, unless and until,
as might well be the case, it was decided to promulgate some general rule against
the keeping of diaries by members of this Office.^17

In effect Bridges stood the sui generis argument on its head, insisting that
Hankey's memoirs were unique in his perspective upon the inner
workings of government, which would suffer through their publication.
The Supreme Command, it is fair to say, appeared to Edward Bridges
not another memoir about the First World War but rather a singular
revelation of the influence wielded by civil servants, the depiction of
which could undermine public confidence in the doctrine of ministerial
responsibility.
The second Cabinet Secretary thus supplemented the 1934 limitations
which the first had brought to bear upon ministerial memoirs with an
even far more wide-ranging stricture against civil servants commenting
upon the relationship to ministers. In seeking to proscribe such
revelations about the inner workings of government Bridges might well
have used Hankey's own words to deny the request: 'Unfortunately the
practice of doing so started immediately after the war, with the result that


272 A man and an institution

much secret material had been used which, in the public interest, it would
have been far better not to have published.'^18 The interpretation of the
public interest, whether affected by official materials or memoirs, now lay
in the hands of Sir Edward Bridges. Hankey pursued the matter with the
Prime Minister, who was ultimately responsible, although he informed
Bridges that they must agree to disagree: 'I believe on a very long
experience that your fears are wholly groundless. So much has been said
already... that my own relationship to Ministers is very generally
known already. I had apprehensions at one time that this might have some
effect on the office, but it had none.'^19 In pitting his own experience
against his successor's timidity, Hankey either failed to see or ignored the
fact that Bridges had based his case upon the principle that civil servants
ought not to pass retrospective judgment upon ministers or their policies.
In communicating with Churchill, Hankey assembled the justification
for publication of his memoirs: the events were now more than a quarter-
century distant, and other war memoirs had addressed the point of the
relations between ministers and advisers. In pointing to memoirs written
by the latter, Hankey enumerated military figures only, but he insisted
that his status during the conflict' resembled that of a high Service Staff
Officer more than that of a Civil Servant.'^20 He noted that a number of
statesmen, including Asquith, Bonar Law, Balfour, Lloyd George, and
Smuts, had urged the eventual publication of his memoirs, and he
reminded the premier that Churchill's own memoirs constituted a
rebuttal of Bridges' fears: 'Much good and no harm resulted from their
publication. They did not affect the relations of Ministers and their
advisers detrimentally; rather the contrary.' The appeal proved in vain,
and Bridges' hand is apparent in Churchill's informing Hankey that 'the
War Cabinet have reached the conclusion that the publication of the book
would not be in the public interest,' specifying the concern felt for the
protection of the 'special relationship' between ministers and their chief
advisers, which would be subverted by' keep[ing] - still more to reveal - a
private record of the many secret and confidential matters which come
before him [the adviser] in the course of his official duties.'^21
As if unable to believe the War Cabinet's decision, Hankey inquired
testily whether his personal and confidential letter to Churchill had been
brought to the War Cabinet's attention, and Bridges assured him such
had been the case.^22 As the shock registered, Hankey refused to accept at
face value such an explanation, advancing to Tom Jones a different
explanation:
It is astonishing that Churchill, who was practically the first to publish all the
inner secrets of his rows with Fisher, and so many intimate and confidential
letters, should now have the effrontery to turn me down - but I have little doubt

Churchill was wrong. Probably also the large Civil Service element - John
Anderson, Grigg and Bridges - who have always been against the Cabinet Office
and generally obscurantist - have had something to say.^23
While Hankey lamented to Jones, who had maintained a diary while at the
Secretariat, that 'an immense number of public servants from Prime
Ministers to bottlewashers have not only kept diaries but they were used
afterwards to describe the same sort of incidents that I described' - he
itemized Asquith, Haig, Henry Wilson, John French, and Ian Hamilton-
he simply could not conceive that his role was different in kind from the
activities of those whom he specified. Nor is there any reason to think that
Hankey was aware of the fact that other civil servants, whose service had
overlapped his last years at Whitehall Gardens, had kept diaries which
would later lay bare the relationship between ministers and advisers.
Only with the eventual failure of Bridges and Norman Brook to prevail in
proscribing diaries as the basis for such accounts did the private diaries
maintained by Hankey's former associates Jones and Henry Pownall
emerge; the latter had begun a diary upon entering the CID Secretariat in
1933, with no eye on publication but a purpose limited to 'a harmless
outlet for his irascible feelings about individuals.'^24
In that same year, a senior Foreign Office official. Sir Alexander
Cadogan, also started a diary, which assumes crucial importance with his
appointment as Permanent Under-Secretary in 1938. Although he had
no interest to publish the diary, its existence was known to the
Foreign Secretary, Lord Halifax, as early as 1939, when he used portions
of the diary to outline the events which had led to the outbreak of the
war.^25 The episode demonstrates the utility of such a private record as a
supplement to official accounts, but Bridges a few years later could see
only the deleterious effects of publishing diary extracts. Had the second
Cabinet Secretary known the contents of Cadogan's record, his fears
likely would have been strengthened, precisely because 'the Diary
provided a place for Cadogan to express himself without restraint, a
comforting outlet in a life of excessive burden and business.' In a sense,
Cadogan continued Hankey's record of the inner workings of government

- Hankey's diary extended well beyond the end of the First World War -
    although the perspectives were quite different, and Cadogan's interest in
    the process of government rather less. Yet with the possible exception of
    Bridges for a portion of the period, no one stood closer to the center of
    power for the whole of the years between 1938 and 1950.^26
       Yet another perspective on foreign affairs in the crucial years before
    and after Munich is supplied in the diaries of Oliver Harvey, who served
    as Private Secretary to Eden and Halifax; his acid comments on the moral
    cowardice of the Chamberlain Cabinet reveal the frustration so often
    sublimated by advisers in their diary entries.^27 A third perspective from


```

```
within the Foreign Office can be found in the diary of the war period by
Sir Robert Bruce Lockhart; the editor of that diary, Kenneth Young, has
remarked of Lockhart's disposition that he was' a diplomat by nature, but
fortunately indiscreet in his diaries, a fault, if such it is, that must endear
him to succeeding generations.'^28 Without the element of indiscretion-to
record what otherwise might have gone unnoted - the diaries maintained
by such officials would lose a good part of their unique value. Obviously,
diaries must be used with caution and a sense of proportion - not only is
the diarist likely to loom larger than life, but on occasion he may record
impressions based upon incomplete or erroneous perceptions of events^29

- but diaries do convey 'the immediate impression and atmosphere'^30 in
    which decisions must be taken and thus afford insights about the
    workings of government and the formulation of policy.^31 Yet another
    explanation for the existence of such private records may be hazarded,
    arising from the fact that civil servants and diplomats were denied access
    to any official records of their activities. Prior to the Public Records Act of
       1958 advisers had no way of protecting themselves from ministerial
    criticism, by official documentation. To be sure, the Cabinet Office sought
    to provide against such prejudicial treatment, but highly placed advisers
    had reason - beyond placing themselves at the center of events - to
    maintain a record of their activities and ministerial foibles.
       While Hankey prepared an appeal of the War Cabinet's decision, Tom
    Jones cautioned him that while the proscription came as a 'bombshell,'
    the timing of publication of diary extracts represented a legitimate
    concern; he thought there was no question about the propriety of a civil
    servant's keeping a diary.^32 Spurred by his former deputy's sympathies,
    Hankey pressed him to read the memoirs, from which he was excising
    'many of the more flippant passages that Churchill would not like, but of
    course I cannot alter history.'^33 Hankey reiterated the justice of his case in
    asserting to Jones that' if I cannot publish with permission I propose to
    publish without permission.'^34 The 'man of secrets' found himself in an
    odd position.
       Yet upon a close reading of Hankey's manuscript Jones drew back from
    his initial advice that Hankey should have no hesitation in arranging for
    publication:
    I am not surprised that the Cabinet should hesitate to pass these volumes for
    publication at this comparatively early stage. It is bound to have a profound effect
    on the habits of future Secretaries to the Cabinet and Ministers, and the financial
    temptations for revelations will be great. There are other repercussions one can
    imagine.^35
    Hankey admitted to being' shaken' by Jones' remarks, but he nonetheless
    adhered to the position that his diary had been singled out for
    suppression. Despite the flood of war memoirs and biographies, many

###### based on diaries, Hankey still insisted that the relationship between

###### ministers and their advisers had not been compromised. This observation

###### strengthened his appeal, sent to Bridges on 29 March, in which he

###### stressed the legitimacy of his diary, which had served a functional

###### purpose during the war years: 'My own diary aimed at describing the

###### numerous "off the record" decisions, conversations and events bearing

###### on policy, of which no other record existed, and which I found absolutely

###### essential to the work of co-ordination with which Mr. Asquith charged

###### me at the outset of the war.'^36 Citing the lack of official records in those

###### years, Hankey stressed the need for such a compilation of events.

###### Hankey's appeal broke no new ground: insofar as he narrowed the issue,

###### he argued that' to make a new rule ad hoc, applying to a single individual,

###### whose status differs little from that of some previous writers, involves a

###### discrimination that is untenable.' He reported progress as a result of his

###### meeting again with Bridges: 'I have now agreed everything... except

###### the question of principle as to using diary extracts, on which he is very

#### obstinate. I fancy he wants to find a way out which will not hurt his amour

###### propre.^937 Towards such an avenue, Hankey agreed to discussions with

###### two ministers, but Churchill's government fell from office; a new Labour

###### Cabinet inherited - among more pressing problems - the question of

###### Hankey's war memoirs.

###### While Churchill withdrew to Chartwell to prepare his massively

###### documented Second World War, for which he had secured official license,

###### Hankey renewed his unsuccessful quest for sanction to publish his

###### account of the British role in the last war but one. Attlee agreed to

###### Bridges' suggestion that two Labour ministers talk to Hankey about his

###### memoirs, but they subsequently informed Hankey that two types of

###### revision were required: extracts from the diary would have to be omitted,

###### and Hankey would also have to delete ' detailed records about your day to

###### day relations with Ministers and the relations between Ministers'; these

###### revisions would then have to be submitted to the Prime Minister before

###### the amended version could be approved.^38 Hankey professed his willing-

###### ness to comply with the first condition and to comply with ' a reasonable

###### interpretation of the second,' although he claimed to reserve the right 'to

###### make unrestricted use of material already published, notwithstanding

###### that it may have a bearing on my relations with Ministers... The fact is

###### that the whole story has been told in fragments, although it has never

###### been put together.' But he drew the line at the third condition, in a fashion

###### which suggested that his amour propre was no less involved than Bridges':

###### yet there was merit in his claim that he had been co-operative in all

###### particulars, with the result that eighteen months had already passed.^39

###### For that reason, the former Cabinet Secretary resolved to use ' his own

###### discretion' in the matter.


###### 276 A man and an institution

###### The Labour government held fast to the view that the third condition

###### contained no affront to Hankey but remained a prerequisite to publi-

###### cation: consultation with the government of the day was required of

###### ' persons who have accepted high office under the Crown ... in regard to

###### the publication of any confidential matter of which they have acquired

###### official knowledge/ who had further to secure formal permission in

###### 'doubtful cases.'^40 Such a stance was consistent with the 1934 pre-

###### cedent, although the post-war Secretariat likely had concluded that civil

###### servants were otherwise not covered by any formal convention; thus

###### Hankey's account had to be viewed as precedent-setting, however

###### removed the events of the First World War. Hankey was reminded that

###### the responsibility for 'vetting' was vested in the Cabinet Office: 'If we

###### were now to agree that you should publish your book without resubmit-

###### ting it you would be, in marginal cases, the judge of what could or could

###### not be published.' For his part, Hankey took counsel with Field-Marshal

###### Smuts, who pressed him to write 'first-class history' above all else. The

###### former Cabinet Secretary concluded that the hundreds of excisions and

###### the loss of the whole of the diary extracts undertaken 'to try and meet the

###### timidity of the official censorship' had compromised the historical

###### standing which he sought for his book. Thus Hankey decided 'to

###### withdraw all my concessions and to bide my time. I am not sure that it will

###### be very long. A strong feeling is growing up inside and outside the Service

###### about the Government's obscurantist attitude in recent years towards the

###### publication of memoirs, etc.'^41 Whether Hankey had any other evidence

###### to that effect is problematic, since his book was the only one so

###### questioned, at a time when the government had become deliberately

###### permissive about memoirs of the Second World War; further he erred in

###### thinking that his time would soon come: some fifteen years were to pass

###### before a shortened version appeared, even then without official

###### permission.

###### Hankey's decision not 'to publish and be damned' in fact constituted a

###### precedent which Tom Jones, for one, had recognized would tell against

###### the publication of his own diaries.^42 Unlike Hankey, he did not live to

###### witness that event, as far as those portions of his diary dealing with the

###### Cabinet Secretariat were concerned: he made the attempt in 1954, at

###### which time he published Diary with Letters, 1931-1950, but he withdrew

###### the earlier portions when asked to make substantial excisions by Bridges,

###### by this time Head of the Civil Service, and his successor at the Cabinet

###### Office, Sir Norman Brook.^43 According to one interview which Jones gave

###### at this time, he denied that official pressure had been exerted and

###### acknowledged that he had' doubts' about publishing diaries based on his

###### years in the Civil Service at this time; Jones tacitly recognized that

###### advisers could not justify their accounts on the same grounds used by


###### The custody of Cabinet secrecy 277

###### ministers, and he admitted that 'it was "only right" that former civil

###### servants should submit any projected publication for examination.'^44 His

###### experience paralleled Hankey's although it appears that Tom Jones was

###### more reconciled to delay in publication.

###### There is no indication that in these years Hankey and his former deputy

###### were threatened with the Official Secrets Act as a bar to publication,

###### although Hankey inferred a connection because of Addison's reference to

###### 'official knowledge.' He was sufficiently concerned to prepare a mem-

###### orandum dealing with the 'Legal Aspects' of publication; Hankey

###### contended that the Official Secrets Act had no bearing upon his memoirs,

###### but he did not press the point because he had decided to withdraw his

###### request for authority to publish.^45 Since he later contested the application

###### of the Act to his case, we will take up that protest in due course.

###### Here, however, we need inquire about the utilization of the Official

###### Secrets Act in the years following upon the widened purview given it in

###### the 1930s. Insofar as the protection of Cabinet business is concerned, its

###### long shadow seemed to suffice, and the thrust of its application lay

###### elsewhere, perhaps in an even more arbitrary fashion. In mid-193 8

###### section 6 was brought to bear upon a journalist in an attempt to secure

###### information concerning another journalist's proposing a bribe to a police

###### officer to forewarn a criminal of his impending arrest; its terms served to

###### protect whatever was classified as an official secret, ' the principle being

###### that it is the duty of every citizen, irrespective of his status or official

###### position, to assist the authorities by giving any information in his

###### possession as to the commission of offences against the Official Secrets

###### Act.'^46 The press had immediately raised questions concerning the

###### wisdom of directing the Official Secrets Act at rather ordinary criminal

###### proceedings, and the Home Secretary, Sir Samuel Hoare, informed the

###### Cabinet that interrogation under the provisions of section 6 should be

###### limited to what impressed the Attorney-General and the Home Secretary

###### as exceptional cases involving disclosures of military, naval, or state

###### secrets. Cautioned by the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defence that

###### they ought to avoid the impression that' the Government had weakened

###### in this matter as a result of ... agitation' in the press, the Cabinet

###### approved the general lines of Hoare's proposal,^47 although there is no

###### indication that any substantive changes followed. To the contrary,

###### section 6 was soon invoked, directed this time at what HMG regarded as

###### an exceptional case, involving a Member of Parliament, Duncan Sandys,

###### who was Churchill's son-in-law.

###### In the view of the government, Sandys implicitly threatened to reveal

###### the parlous condition of London's anti-aircraft defences in a par-

###### liamentary question directed to the Secretary of State for War, Leslie


###### 278 A man and an institution

###### Hore-Belisha, who had assured the Commons that no critical gaps

###### existed. Although Sandys subsequently denied that such was his

###### intention, Hore-Belisha regarded his possession of secret information a

###### breach of military security and turned the matter over to the Attorney-

###### General, after which, according to Churchill's account,

###### He [Sandys]... was informed, first, that his letter revealed a knowledge of

###### matters covered by the Official Secrets Act: secondly, that he was under an

###### obligation to reveal the sources of his information: and thirdly, after some

conversation and in reply to his request to know what would be the consequences

###### of a refusal to reveal the sources of his information, the Attorney-General

###### confronted him with the text of the Statute, and informed him that this might

###### render him liable to a term of imprisonment not exceeding two years.^48

###### Upon consulting the Speaker and the Clerk of the House of Commons,

###### Sandys learned that a prima facie breach of privilege of the rights of a

###### Member of Parliament had occurred. The Attorney-General quickly

###### assured Sandys that ' there is no question of seeking to exercise against

you now or hereafter the police powers of interrogation under the Official
Secrets Act,'^49 but Sandys took his case to the floor of the House, because
'the general question of the rights and position of Members of the House

###### of Commons, and the discharge of their duties, in relation to the Official

###### Secrets Act' remained unsettled. As Churchill commented in the mem-

###### orandum which he may have circulated to others besides Lloyd George,

###### the issues were of great moment:

First, does the Official Secrets Act enable the Government to institute a criminal

###### proceeding against any Member for refusing to disclose the source of any

information which he may use in the course of his Parliamentary duties; and are
the Government going to use these powers? Secondly, should a Government use
the Official Secrets Act, which was devised to secure the defence of the country, in

###### order to prevent the exposure of Ministers who have neglected their duty?

Thirdly, is not Parliamentary privilege in the larger sense involved in attempts by

###### the Government legal authorities to intimidate Members by threats of

prosecution?

###### After Sandys raised his point of privilege on 27 June, the Cabinet

###### considered both the particular incident, in which the Home Secretary

###### thought the Attorney-General's interview of Sandys ' difficult to defend,'

###### and the implications, in which he voiced the fear that 'if M.P.s were

###### exempt, the Press would insist on exemptions and the Act would soon

###### become a dead letter.' However, the Cabinet could take no action,

because Sandys' complaint had brought the matter subjudice. Nonethe-

###### less, the Cabinet's discussion betrayed an awareness that the rigors of

section 6 had been pursued in the wrong place. The Cabinet's concern was
nonetheless genuine, as Inskip reminded them that' it was notorious that

###### information had been leaking to members of Parliament for some time,

particularly from the Air Force.'^50 Nor could there be doubt that Sandys,


```
The custody of Cabinet secrecy 279
```
```
who had served in a Territorial Army regiment responsible for London's
air defences, possessed military secrets of some magnitude. Hankey's
former assistant Henry Pownall, now Director of Military Operations
and Information at the War Office, noted the extent of Sandys'
knowledge and lamented his behavior:
```
the fact is that Sandys having seduced an officer from his allegiance then shelters
under the umbrella of privilege - not in order to withhold the name of the officer -
he must know perfectly well that we have got that - but to save himself. If that
works there is no room for M.P.s in the T.A. - they cannot be allowed two
loyalties which run counter to each other.

Nor was Sandys' second 'loyalty' difficult to discern: Pownall viewed
him as a cat's paw,' a slippery young gentleman who is certainly backed
up by Winston.'^51
Whether the Sandys investigation was intended partly as a shot across
Churchill's bow is unknown, but Churchill himself had consistently
received information which put him in violation of the Official Secrets
Act.^52 In that sense, the judgment of the Clerk of the House of Commons

- ' a person who communicates official information to a person to whom
    he is not authorised to communicate it, commits no offence if the person
    to whom he discloses it is a person to whom it is his duty in the interests of
    the State to communicate it'^53 - strengthened Churchill's practice.
    Certainly he must have noticed the irony that opposition to an absolutist
    interpretation of the Official Secrets Act had been legitimized by the
    government's inept disclosure of the dangers vested in section 6.
       In the meantime, a Cabinet committee sought to honor the
    government's belief that parliamentary immunity from the powers of
    interrogation vested in the Act ought not to be absolute: 'it would be
    quite wrong to provide in section 6 that Members of Parliament should be
    the only class of the community who have no duty to assist the
    Government in detecting traitors.'^54 Recognizing that only the most
    serious matters ought to call forth this power, the committee nonetheless
    rejected a suggestion that judicial authority should be required to initiate
    the use of section 6; these ministers concluded that the essential interests
    could be protected by limiting the use of interrogation to offences falling
    within the scope of section 1 of the 1911 Act. Thus the Committee on the
    Official Secrets Act differentiated between the felony offence of disclos-
    ing information which could be useful to an enemy, under section 1, and
    the misdemeanor offence of disclosing other official secrets, provided for
    in section 2.^55 Here is the first official recognition that reliance on the law
    of official secrets had become excessive, and that a limitation of the
    powers of interrogation could be safely accepted; an obscure and
    infrequently used section was revised as a means of' satisfying the critics,'
    but the vastly widened use of section 2 in non-espionage matters survived
    unscathed.


280 A man and an institution

While the government introduced a bill to revise section 6 in this
fashion, the House of Commons pursued the alleged breach of privilege.
The Prime Minister admitted to a Select Committee that the Sandys case
had been poorly handled, although he preferred to think that 'a most
extraordinary catalogue of misunderstandings' had been primarily
responsible.^56 The Select Committee reported in June 1939, concluding
that disclosures made during debates or parliamentary proceedings were
not subject to legal action under the Official Secrets Act; similar
protection was claimed for confidences shared by MPs in matters related
to the business of the House. The report left no doubt that Parliament, in
direct response to the Sandys case, protected its proceedings from the
scope of the 1911 and 1920 legislation; in broader terms, the executive's
power to dictate co-operation with the Official Secrets Act had been
limited to espionage-related activities. The reform was noteworthy,
although an attempt made in the House of Lords to amend section 2 by
restricting its use to disclosures made for a purpose prejudicial to the
safety or interests of the state failed.^57 In sum, section 6 was modified, and
thus the ever-widening use of the Official Secrets Act curtailed for the
first time; section 2 stood intact - for many years to come.
The long shadow which the Official Secrets Act had cast over Cabinet
proceedings assumed a more definite form in 1954, when it was first
specifically mentioned as a deterrent; in a fitting fashion, Hankey's former
deputy, Sir Rupert Howorth, long retired from the public service,
insisted upon the connection. Before his intervention, the question of the
secrecy of past Cabinet deliberations had been raised by Aneurin Bevan
in the House of Commons, but in short order the correspondence
columns of The Times became the forum within which the larger question
of the place of such secrecy within a free society was heatedly debated. On
30 July, Bevan raked the ashes of a dispute within the late Labour
government, from which he had resigned. Although his disclosures were
general, the former premier, Attlee, refused to be drawn out by the
allegations, remarking instead that' there is, of course, a well established
rule inhibiting members of a Government from revealing what passes
either in Cabinet or in confidential discussion. The reason for this is
obvious. Unless it is observed, confidence between colleagues is im-
possible.'^58 Bevan returned to the fray, arguing that the issue was not the
doctrine of collective responsibility but the limits of its applicability:
collective Cabinet responsibility breaks down at the point that the collectivity
breaks down, and that is when a Minister resigns ... If it did not do so, no
resigning Minister could say why he resigned, and if any hon. Member likes to
look up the constitutional precedents he will see that that is absolutely clear.^59
Nonetheless, Bevan cited only one precedent, which was less than
compelling because it stemmed from the extraordinary circumstances


```
The custody of Cabinet secrecy 281
```
centering on the collapse of the Labour government in 1931; since that
time, the rules protecting Cabinet secrecy had been considerably
tightened, and as a result the search for precedents would not have been
one-sided, as Bevan suggested. Indeed, when in 1932 Lloyd George
desired to publish a decade-old Cabinet Minute, his request had been
denied and a government spokesman had rejected as mistaken the notion
that

a Cabinet Minister, or former Cabinet Minister, could exercise his own discretion
in deciding when he was released from his obligation of secrecy, or as if... for
example, it was necessary, in order to defend themselves [sic] against a charge or
to convict an opponent of inaccuracy in debate, to disclose Cabinet documents or
information, then they were at liberty to do so ... The only person who can
release a Privy Councillor from his obligation of secrecy is His Majesty the King,
and His Majesty, acting as always in this constitutional country, on the advice of
his Ministers, is in that matter guided by the advice given by the Prime Minister
of the day.^60

Bevan, it appears, exalted his view of the doctrine of collective respons-
ibility and ignored the individual obligations of the Privy Counsellor's
Oath; the point remains that his invocation of precedent was decidedly
weak.
In commenting in the pages of The Times upon the parliamentary
exchange, the Oxford historian A. J. P. Taylor granted the obvious,
namely that Bevan had no right to refer to Cabinet discussions without
the Sovereign's permission secured through the Prime Minister. How-
ever, Taylor was much troubled by the implications of another statement
which Attlee had made, because ' constitutional precedents are made by
politicians dogmatizing about them.' In Taylor's words, the former
premier had asserted that' secrecy applied not only to an existing Cabinet
but covered a previous Cabinet'; for his own part, he insisted that there
was no precedent for the stance ' except as Mr. Attlee himself attempted
to provide during his period of office. Former Cabinet Ministers have
always been free to air their differences once the Cabinet was dissolved.'^61
As an example, Taylor cited the widespread discussion of the events
which had led to Cabinet resignations in the wake of Britain's going to
war in 1914, but he had no way of taking into account the precedents
which ha^b^en forged since those distant events. Yet he did lament the
fact that Cabinet secrecy appeared to be strengthening, which he
regretted all the more as the product of the views of a ' democratic' party.
In replying to Taylor's criticism, Attlee rejected the contention that
Cabinet ministers had always been free to air their differences once a
Cabinet had been dissolved:' To accept this doctrine would be destruct-
ive of the collective responsibility of the Cabinet and of the confidence
which must exist among colleagues in Government.'^62 The former
premier thus developed a historical dimension for the convention which


###### 282 A man and an institution

###### served to bind the Cabinet together as a political entity: what once had

###### been accomplished as a joint responsibility, he seemed to say, must long

###### or always be so treated.

###### Attlee also commented that the doctrine of Cabinet secrecy rep-

###### resented no innovation on his government's part: 'the rule as to the

###### inspection of Cabinet documents' dated to the MacDonald regime two

###### decades earlier. He admitted that at some future, unspecified, time

###### Cabinet records might yield to history's claim upon them, but in the short

###### run acceptance of Taylor's doctrine would 'strike a blow at democratic

###### government.'

###### On the same day, Sir Rupert Howorth stirred from retirement to

###### lament 'the considerable mis-understanding, in Oxford and elsewhere,

###### on the subject of Cabinet secrecy.' Disclosures of Cabinet proceedings

###### were proscribed by the Privy Counsellor's Oath to reveal nothing said or

###### done in Council save with the express consent of the Sovereign, in a

###### fashion stipulated as long ago as 1878; further, the Official Secrets Act

###### bore upon the matter, although its writ ran to all persons alike, whether or

###### not Ministers of the Crown - he noted the successful prosecution of

###### George Lansbury's biographer under the statute.^63 His approach to the

###### Oath and the Act could fairly be described as absolutist, although he

###### recognized that both had on occasion been broken; these exceptions he

###### refused to accept as evidence that the dissolution of a Cabinet freed its

###### members to discuss Cabinet proceedings. Responding to such authoritat-

###### ive commentaries, The Times joined in the fray on 8 August, commenting

###### in a leading article that Bevan had invoked ' a non-existent right of a

###### resigning Minister to reveal such Cabinet discussions as he may consider

###### relevant to the reasons for his resignation.'^64 Taylor's search for

###### precedents was characterized as inadequate, and the relevant comments

###### of the nineteenth-century statesman, Lord Melbourne, had been negle-

###### cted: 'If the arguments in the Cabinet are not to be protected by an

###### impenetrable veil of secrecy, there will be no place left in the public

###### counsels for the free investigation of truth and the unshackled exercise of

###### the understanding.' The Times admitted the claims of history, but added:

###### ' It is not easy to decide when Cabinet proceedings cease to belong to

###### contemporary political debate and pass into history.' Were an error to be

###### made, The Times thought it ought to be on the side of caution, because the

###### alternative was the risk of sacrificing that mutual confidence and

###### confidentiality among ministers which provided the basis for effective

###### Cabinet government.

###### In response to The Times^3 obiter dictum, several correspondents

###### questioned the assertion that Cabinet secrecy had, with well-known

###### exceptions, been preserved inviolate: one cited a number of resignation

###### speeches over the past thirty years which had offended in this regard,


```
The custody of Cabinet secrecy 283
```
without reference to the Sovereign's permission;^65 another cited a
revealing parliamentary exchange dating to 1949 between Churchill and
Ernest Bevin, which no one - The Times included - had complained about
in terms of breach of secrecy. The second correspondent insisted that
recent practices carried greater weight than Victorian precepts:

the rule has in recent times been interpreted, both in regard to resignation
speeches from a Government in being and generally in regard to former
administrations, as still precluding the publication without permission of Cabinet
papers... but not as extending to statements by former Ministers indicating
their degree of personal responsibility for some particular matter of policy.^66

Such a distinction was particularly valid in light of the exchange between
Lloyd George and the National Government in 1932; it also afforded
the government a reasonable means of preserving the secrecy of Cabinet
papers, while conceding to former ministers a freedom of discussion
which a number of them had already claimed, whether in resignation
speeches or thereafter.
Howorth remained unimpressed with the arguments advanced by the
'moderns,' reiterating the strictures of the Privy Counsellor's Oath and
the 'very sharp and penetrating teeth' of the Official Secrets Act. Nor
could he credit the concessions made in the name of history both by Attlee
and The Times: ' The documents of each administration are domestic to
that Administration and it is open to a Cabinet on vacating office to direct
that all its documents should be destroyed without exception.'^67 Indeed,
such a concern had contributed to the National Government's decision to
recover all Cabinet papers, an action taken 'by way of compromise of this
difficult problem.' While Howorth regarded destruction as 'deplorable,'
there exists no evidence to indicate that such an alternative had at any
time been brought to the attention of MacDonald's Cabinet.
The discussion of Cabinet secrecy took on additional legalistic
trappings when another correspondent contended that no earlier ' state-
ments ' of resignation had any weight at law in determining whether
Bevan had any ' right' to contravene an Act of Parliament - presumably
the Official Secrets Act.^68 In dismissing that accumulation of conventions
which is referred to as precedent, such a posture appears all the more
misplaced since the leading authority on Cabinet government, Ivor
Jennings, had held that the ' efficient sanction' in maintaining Cabinet
secrecy was neither the Oath nor the Official Secrets Act but rather in the
main a rule of'practice.'^69 Thus, the practice of resignation speeches was
as established a doctrine as that of collective responsibility, although the
weight of tradition supporting the latter was greater. Where rules of
'practice' are in a state of evolution, as clearly is the case with Cabinet
government, flexibility and change are part of the system: absolutism is
misguided.

The significance of this entire exchange lies, of course, in the greater
concern which forms the backdrop to the Bevan disclosures, namely the
place of Cabinet secrecy within a democratic society. This matter too had
been commented upon:' The ordinary citizen, whose right and duty it is
to judge the policies of his leaders, should have the freest possible means
of knowing what is decided in his name.' This correspondent ac-
knowledged the need for the preservation of strategic secrets, but he
viewed secrecy as in itself an' evil,' and he characterized as dangerous the
argument that most disclosures were contrary to the public interest: the
exposure to truth was a vital ingredient of a democracy, which was not
defenceless against improper disclosures. Among its weapons was the
Official Secrets Act, ' undoubted and dangerous breaches' of which he
was prepared to entrust to a British jury.^70 Vital concerns these, involving
what has come to be known as the public's 'right to know,' which in a
democracy must nonetheless be balanced against the need for ad-
ministrative secrecy: no Cabinet government based on the useful
convention of collective responsibility can afford consistently to ventilate
its differences. Immediate access to the records of government in the
name of the 'right to know' could destroy any Cabinet effectiveness, for
all the fact that the political aspects of contemporary Cabinet government
seem to require deliberate leakage of portions of its business in a variety of
ways. In contentious matters particularly, leading ministers and senior
civil servants on occasion disregard, to a degree, the principles of secrecy;
their critics within the government may be even more pressed to ensure
that their dissent from some misguided policy is recognized.^71 Thus the
galaxy of 'informed sources,' 'highly placed officials,' and 'confidants'
contradict within the political process what is upheld as the rule of
Cabinet secrecy. Yet such deliberate leakages do not pose the problem for
Cabinet government that a systematic deference to the public's ' right to
know' would entail.
Nor should this routine hypocrisy, designed to vent the pressures of
politics, excuse the post-Second World War expansion of the scope of
administrative secrecy - Cabinet secrecy is but a part - which has spread
far beyond those matters which need to be cloaked, for instance Cabinet
proceedings, diplomatic relations, and national defence. A persuasive
study of such executive secrecy^72 documents the spread of the practice,
intended for the most part to serve governmental convenience and
enforced by resort to section 2 of the Official Secrets Act. Sufficient
adverse reaction eventually led to the appointment in April 1971 of the
Franks Departmental Committee; its investigation of the operation of
section 2 came little more than a year later, concluding that 'a section
which has been described as an ancient blunderbuss, scattering shot in all
directions, needs replacement by a modern weapon.' The Franks


```
The custody of Cabinet secrecy 285
```
Committee advised that section 2 should be repealed and replaced by the
narrower and more specific provisions of an Official Information Act,
directing criminal sanctions only at the most important official inform-
ation, which the committee proceeded to itemize.^73 What is most relevant
here is that the Franks Committee provided for the protection of Cabinet
documents, including all papers submitted to the Cabinet or the
committees composed of ministers, and all records of Cabinet proceed-
ings. In the context of Cabinet secrecy within a democratic society their
rationale is worth recording:

The operation of our entire system of government turns on the proper
functioning of the Cabinet. Unauthorised publication of Cabinet documents
could undermine public confidence to the point where the Government would
find it difficult to perform the essential functions of government... The Cabinet
works on the doctrine of collective responsibility. Whatever the individual views
of its members, when the Cabinet reaches a decision it is the decision of them all.
Each shares in the collective responsibility of that decision. Anything that
damages the collective unity and integrity of the Cabinet damages the govern-
ment of this country.^74

Although this formulation ignores several of the ways in which collective
responsibility as a theory is compromised in practice, the Franks
Committee acknowledged the presence of political gossip in Westminster

- ' it is unreasonable to expect the silence of the monastery in a modern
    centre of government' - while differentiating such 'small coin' from
    publications which would impair the governmental process. In 1979
    HMG resolved to remove criminal sanctions from the disclosures of
    information related to Cabinet documents, unless those documents fall
    into one of the categories which would still be protected. Apparently the
    government is now reasonably confident that other devices, discussed
    below, will serve to protect an appropriate measure of secrecy for Cabinet
    proceedings. The 'blunderbuss' of section 2 was not a weapon well-
    designed to bolster the secrecy in which the modern Cabinet must
    function; yet such secrecy will be preserved for the foreseeable future.^75

```
The deficiencies of section 2 have become clear over the years, but its writ
loomed considerable for those of the inter-war generation who sought to
record their observations about the policies and statesmen of that era.
The restrictions upon ministerial memoirs forged in 1934 remained in
place; civil servants and diplomats were barred from use of any official
documents. Yet from time to time, the curtains of secrecy had parted,
particularly for fleeting glances at the way in which British foreign policy
had been conducted: one such outspoken revelation came from the pen of
the former British Ambassador in Vienna, Sir Walford Selby, a long-time
critic of Sir Warren Fisher's alleged undue interference in matters of
policy and of senior diplomatic appointments.^76 Selby's ill feelings
```

gained an even wider audience with his 1953 memoir. Diplomatic
Twilight, in which he castigated Fisher's role specifically and called into
question Vansittart's tenure as Permanent Under-Secretary. Although
the Foreign Office objected to these strictures in its official review of
Selby's account, he refused to amend what amounted to an idee fixe, and
he was permitted to proceed. Since Vansittart's rejoinder was un-
characteristically restrained and less than compelling,^77 Selby's parting
of the pre-war diplomatic curtains attracted some attention.
Almost certainly Vansittart's response would have been stronger had
he been permitted to cite official documents, but such was not the case:
already his Lessons of My Life, published in 1943, was not so informed,
and he subsequently was denied authority to quote from his own official
papers,' on the grounds that no civil servant, whether serving or retired,
"may be permitted to publish privately memoranda written in his official
capacity.'"^78 Although Vansittart protested a situation in which 'there
should be one law for those who give their whole life to the Service of the
State and another for politicians,'^79 HMG did not budge, and Vansittart
was obliged to use his papers in a circumspect fashion, which his latest
biographer contends contributed to the much-remarked upon ' abstruse-
ness ' of his incomplete memoirs, The Mist Procession, published in 1958.
His near-contemporary Ivone Kirkpatrick brought out his memoirs in
1959, only a few years after his retirement from a career that had led to the
Permanent Under-Secretaryship, but he took care so far as recent events
were concerned ' to give no account of conversations or transactions with
men who are still active in the fields of politics or diplomacy,' from a sense
of respect for their confidences. Kirkpatrick's account traversed post-war
events, but in such an anodyne fashion that one cannot imagine its
provoking official indignation. Ultimately diplomats were granted access
to documents which they had prepared, although the right to quote from
such materials is subject to temporal limitations.^80 Vansittart's difficulties
establish that the separation of the Foreign Service from the Civil Service
was not responsible for such a change in attitude.
In an official climate which was hostile to the discussion of
ministerial-adviser relationships, fittingly Lord Hankey seized the
opportunity afforded him in 1957 by congratulations sent his way from
Prime Minister Macmillan on the occasion of his eightieth birthday. The
premier had paid him the compliment of writing that' it must give you
great satisfaction to reflect that the system which you introduced forty
years ago is still in force to-day,' which encouraged Hankey to approach
the new incumbent in Downing Street, not least because of Macmillan's
own background in publishing.^81 In writing Macmillan, Hankey sought
to avoid the past controversy by stressing the importance of ' three new
factors,' namely the passage of forty years since the Armistice of 1918, the


```

```
deaths of all principal characters in his memoirs save Churchill, and the
recent' signs of a more tolerant attitude towards quotations from private
diaries in recently published memoirs, e.g. Field Marshal Viscount
Alanbrooke's Diaries, and some others.' The last point was particularly
significant, he noted, because on two past occasions his negotiations with
the government had broken down due to their insistence that he eliminate
all quotations from his own diary.^82 And surely the war-time CIGS's
diary shed light upon the relationships between ministers and advisers,
but Macmillan - and of course the Cabinet Office - were not persuaded,
since such accounts of the Second World War had been given great
latitude. Even if the military had not been awarded the preferential
treatment given ministers, the official view would not concede to Hankey
the military analogy, as Macmillan informed him: 'The basis of the
earlier decisions was that publication of the book, by laying bare the inner
workings of the Central Government machine, would be likely to impair
for the present and the future the relations between Ministers and their
most intimate official advisers.'^83 Noting that the force of such an
objection had not lessened since 1946, Macmillan held out no hope of
official approval, and carefully he narrowed the issue to Hankey's past
position as Secretary to the Cabinet, commenting that' if I thought that
the present holder of this office was keeping a private diary.. .my official
relations with him would be very different from what they are today.'
Macmillan left no doubt that he spoke on behalf of Sir Edward Bridges
and Sir Norman Brook, Hankey's successors at the Cabinet Office, who
shared the Prime Minister's notion that the nature of their position
barred the keeping of a diary.^84 Confronted with the bitter truth that his
memoirs had become the object of a unique prohibition, Hankey replied
intemperately to Macmillan: 'All I need say at the moment is that I do not
accept your decision to maintain the ban.'^85
Wisely, Hankey took counsel before proceeding; his former assistant,
' Pug' Ismay, who had served as an official adviser to Churchill during the
war, was appalled to learn of the renewed prohibition: ' I should have
thought that considering the time that has elapsed since they were
written, they could have been published verbatim. But I should have
thought that at the very worst they might ask you to omit certain passages
which seemed to them objectionable.'^86 Hankey and his agent next sought
the legal advice of the former Conservative Attorney-General, Sir Lionel
Heald, who advised him to run no risk of violating the Official Secrets
Act, 'a most unsatisfactory and indefinite statute.'^87 In due course he
raised the matter with the Prime Minister, who offered to seek the advice
of Lord Salisbury, although Hankey refused the idea of what amounted
to binding arbitration. It was as well that he did, because Salisbury did
not even examine the manuscript, as the principle was clear: 'He would


288 A man and an institution

```
personally regard it as entirely wrong for anybody who has held the
position as Secretary to the Cabinet to publish within his own lifetime
and that of others concerned a book containing information which he
acquired in that capacity.'^88
Unwisely but perhaps unwittingly, Hankey continued his correspon-
dence with Downing Street in a fashion which brought yet another factor
into play. In assuring Macmillan that' whatever else might be the effect of
the Official Secrets Act, it certainly does not empower the executive to
veto the publication of a book without regard to its contents,' Hankey
opened himself to a withering reply grounded on that very statute. The
Prime Minister dismissed Hankey's contention that HMG's veto was
unrelated to the 'actual contents' of his war memoirs:
On the contrary, it is because of its contents that we have objected to its
publication ... I enclose an extract from Section 2 of the Act: you will not, I
think, need a lawyer's interpretation to realise that this makes it an offence for any
person who has held an official position to publish any information which he has
acquired by virtue of holding that position. And it cannot be contested that in
your book you would be publishing such information.^89
Macmillan tempered this warning with an appeal to Hankey's sense of the
public interest, pointing out that official opinion had run unanimously
against publication; further, he strove to convince by differentiating
between the memoirs of civil servants and those written by members of
the Foreign Service or Armed Forces, because the latter were exposed to
'public comment and criticism,' while the former were not, 'least of all,
perhaps, the Secretary of the Cabinet... closest to the Prime Minister
and... furthest removed from the public eye.' In his turn, Hankey
reiterated the technical point that he had not been a civil servant during
the war, and again observed ' how fundamentally your conception of the
Cabinet Secretary differs from that of your predecessors from 1911 to
1938... given the totally different conditions in which I served from
those of my successors to-day, no harm whatever would result to my
present successor.'^90 The Prime Minister and the Cabinet Secretary
simply would not grant this point, and Hankey had keenly to feel the
weight of the Official Secrets Act, which his office had first invoked to
protect the secrecy of the inner workings of government. Though one
may regard his plight as apposite, it is difficult not to sympathize with an
old man, possessed of a unique perspective, who felt that rules had been
changed in order to deny him an opportunity to relate his account of
distant war years.
Nor could he anticipate at this point that the worst was past, although
in fact he had to compromise his account in order to publish while he
lived. In the meantime, he was disappointed in his prospective publisher,
Cassells, which decided in 1957 that the passing years had destroyed
```

```

```
public interest in his book; other publishers declined the manuscript,
completed a decade-and-half earlier. Comments at Hutchinson's were
negative but reflected an entirely different view from HMG's about the
content of the memoirs and the timing of their publication: one reported
that 'the book has been written about 40 years too late' - so much for
historical accounts - and the other judged that Hankey had been
prevented 'from taking sides and blowing gaffes, but, by that very token

... precluded from writing a good, readable, fascinating book.'^91
However, Allen and Unwin expressed interest in publishing, and Hankey
was persuaded to agree to an abridged version in two volumes, edited to
that end by the journalist R. T. Clark, who received no credit when the
memoirs were finally published. Better news yet came from Heald in
December 1959: he reported Macmillan's view that Hankey had behaved
well about the book and now concluded that although he was not
prepared to authorise publication, he suggested, in Hankey's words, that
'we should not be interfered with if we adopted the present plan of
publishing the abbreviated version without asking authority.'^92 Benign
neglect seemed the most the former Cabinet Secretary could hope for,
and his publishers proceeded in the midst of official silence.^93 The
Supreme Command, 1914-1918 appeared in 1961, and Hankey sent copies
to two of his prime ministerial antagonists, Churchill and Macmillan,
rather churlishly commenting to the latter that he had ' not emulated the
much wider license accorded to the published memoirs and diaries of the
Second World War.'^94
Yet the publication even of an abridged, expurgated version of
Hankey's memoirs stood as an important exception to the post-war
insistence that retired civil servants not publish accounts based upon
officially acquired information. Whether Hankey's plea that he had not
been a civil servant during the Great War had contributed to HMG's
willingness to look the other way is open to doubt, because Hankey by
virtue of his post would be viewed as a civil servant. Nor was the official
stance against the prohibition weakening, as new regulations prom-
ulgated in 1957 by Sir Norman Brook made clear: 'The aim of these
procedures ... is to ensure that Crown Servants and former Crown
Servants and in some cases persons outside the government service are
aware that the publication of any official information which has not
already officially been made public renders them liable to prosecution
under the Official Secrets Act.'^95 These regulations applied to all
information officially acquired, not merely secret information, and the
directive has since been reissued on several occasions, with only minor
amendments. Shortly after its issuance, however, Parliament passed the
Public Records Act of 1958: although not stipulated in the legislation,
and despite objections from the Cabinet Office,^96 Cabinet papers were


```
290 A man and an institution
```
shortly made accessible at a fifty-year remove; thus the eventual
emergence of 'official information' relating to Cabinet business, includ-
ing the relations between ministers and their advisers, was assured.
Although there is some evidence that suggests the Cabinet Office brought
pressure to bear upon biographers to eschew any discussion of the work of
civil servants, at least for the post-war period,^97 the publication of
Hankey's memoirs indicates that his successors had at last yielded the
struggle over the ultimate historical depiction of the confidential
relationship. In 1961 a former civil servant, Lord Salter, published
memoirs in which he recalled meeting ' on terms of official intimacy the
leading political figures of the day,' including Lloyd George, Lord
Robert Cecil, and C. F. G. Masterman.^98 At a considerable remove in
time, Hankey and Salter illumed that relationship. Following upon their
accounts, books from the likes of Cadogan, Harvey, and Lockhart on the
Foreign Office side and, on the civil, the memoirs of George Mallaby," in
addition to the Thomas Jones Whitehall Diary and RoskilPs extensive
citation of the Hankey diaries, have established the freedom for civil
servants to disclose 'official information' after a suitable period, now
apparently thirty years. Where diaries have been kept, eventually they
will emerge, however great Cabinet Office distaste for the genre.

```
As this pattern gradually changed, so too did that which assured public
access to governmental records, at a considerable remove in time from the
actual proceedings. Even the small-scale tempest of August 1952
contributed to the public awareness that history was not being well
served, and in 1958 public access to the most important records of
government after the passing of a half-century was attained. Dissatisfac-
tion with inaccessibility of such records was hardly a post-war pheno-
menon, because the point had been made as long ago as 1899 that' on the
general question of keeping documents secret there is no country in
Europe which is so scrupulous and old-fashioned in imposing secrecy on
its documents as is this country.'^100 In some cases access was granted to
historians who were thought to be impartial, which may account for the
fact that the Chief Secretary for Ireland proved particularly unyielding in
denying access to papers dealing with Ireland after the time of the
rebellion of 1798.^101 At the end of the Victorian period, the Home Office
enforced a prohibition on access to records post-dating 1800; on the other
hand, the Foreign Office had decided in 1924 to open its records through
the end of 1878, yielding to historians' entreaties to permit a realistic
evaluation of British foreign policy.^102 The Colonial Office had freed
many of its nineteenth-century documents, yet even in the second half of
the twentieth the Home Office had retained all its records post-dating
1800 and a good many from earlier; only a small portion of Home Office
```

```
records had been transferred to the Public Record Office.^103 In short,
since the Public Records Act had been written in 1838, arrangements for
the transfer of departmental records varied widely, and the departments
determined the closed period, selecting a suitable date to open collections
'as nearly as possible without reserve.'^104 In 1954 a Committee on
Departmental Records, chaired by Sir James Grigg, had recommended
that the custody and public utilization of government records should be
systematized and regularized; they stressed the importance of protecting
the quality of' unself-consciousness' on the part of those who originally
prepared the documents, contending that the public interest would suffer
'if an official knew that what he wrote would be available for public
inspection during his life time.'^105 With no haste, the Conservative
regime determined that both government records and legal records
should be subject to the same general system, under the supervision of the
Lord Chancellor.
Macmillan's government subsequently decided to accept the recom-
mendation of the Grigg Committee that the government records -
transferred to the Public Record Office after review and winnowing -
should be made available for inspection after fifty years, or such other
period, whether longer or shorter, as the Lord Chancellor might
prescribe. Defending such exceptions, the Solicitor-General, Sir Harry
Hylton-Foster, commented: 'The object is to withhold from public
inspection, should it be necessary, documents the publication of which
after so long a period as fifty years might be harmful,'^106 which as the law
came to be implemented fell into four categories: documents containing
information about individuals whose disclosure could cause distress or
embarrassment to living persons or their immediate descendants, such as
criminal, prison, or certain police records; those containing information
obtained with a pledge of confidence, such as census returns; certain
papers relating to Irish affairs - seemingly a constant exception to any
rule; and sensitive papers which affect the security of the state, including
intelligence activities.^107 For other records the government specified as a
' general rule' the passage of fifty years before public access, which would
afford statutory form to a slowly developing custom. In setting such a
period, they accepted the Grigg Committee's assumption that fifty years
represented a' normal period in relation to the life of a man' and so would
assure 'the preservation of unself-consciousness in the writing of
records.'^108 Some parliamentary critics thought such a scheme in-
adequate, and one commented that while fifty years may have been
appropriate for the Victorian period, in the twentieth century history had
accelerated and moved forward' in bursts,' which access to public records
ought to recognize. The Solicitor-General reminded the government's
critics that the Lord Chancellor was empowered to grant exceptions, and


```
292 A man and an institution
```
the decision was sustained by a partisan vote in a thin Friday sitting of the
House of Commons.^109
In a sense parliamentary debate was perfunctory, but several concerns
were raised which serve to indicate the confusion in which the question of
the custody of Cabinet documents had become enveloped. One MP
argued that ' the genuine student of history' was discriminated against,
because Cabinet ministers had retained Cabinet Minutes and mem-
oranda since the time such records had been maintained on a scientific
basis.^110 As no government spokesman took the trouble to correct his
allegation, he must be forgiven his confusion, because the massive
exception provided for ministerial retention of self-authored memoranda
for the Second World War could easily be mistaken for license to retain
official documents on an even more comprehensive scale. To be sure,
ministerial memoirs and those of their service advisers remained outside
the scope of the fifty-year rule, and the Cabinet Office at this time
remained hopeful that Cabinet papers would not be made available under
the terms of the new legislation; the situation was a complex one.
If this official attitude were generally known in Westminster, the fact
would explain another odd feature of the debate, namely the fear that
certain categories of documents might be destroyed as a result of the 1958
legislation. Such fears proved to be groundless, but the words of the
Solicitor-General in introducing the Public Records Act - to the effect
that it would authorise the destruction of those records which ought not
be preserved - fueled such concerns. Indeed, Hylton-Foster had to
assure the House that 'no one is destroying Cabinet papers.'^111 Ac-
knowledging that these represented ' the most important and informative
of all State papers,' he cautioned that the several political parties had yet
to resolve certain problems concerning Cabinet documents, and royal
assent also had to be secured. Nonetheless, his words mark the first
official assurance that HMG had agreed to the principle of public access
to a category of official documents which had to this time been rigorously
closed to all save ministers and, in theory, their vindicators.
In light of this development, then, Macmillan's reversal of position
concerning the publication of Hankey's memoirs can properly be
understood. Despite the fact that the Prime Minister threatened Hankey
with the use of the Official Secrets Act a week after Parliament had
approved the Public Records Act, surely the implications of the 1958
legislation led Macmillan tacitly to suggest that Hankey publish his
memoirs without seeking official approval.^112 Likely Hankey would have
been able to publish his fuller, three volume account, but the decision to
abridge had been his publisher's. The advent of the fifty-year rule meant
that the full range of Cabinet documents for the First World War would
be released within a decade's time; governmental acquiescence merely

Chapman Pincher, an informed defence journalist, that the Ultra
techniques continued to yield secrets of state in Africa, the Middle East,
South America and elsewhere to the British and American operators for
yet another thirty years after the end of the war!^120
Insofar as the closed period for post-war British documents is
concerned, it has been suggested that any dealing with the country's
involvement in the Suez expedition will be sealed for a full century.^121
Others have indicated that records involving discussions with France and
Israel prior to Suez were either not kept, or had a circulation far less than
that of the full Cabinet and were subsequently burned.^122 If surviving
records are closed for a full century, they will share that restriction with
records related to the Abdication crisis of 1936.^123 However, in the case of
the Suez papers, one might hope for a reconsideration of such an
inordinate proscription, which otherwise serves to indicate that the
British government has a blot on the record worth hiding.
Macmillan's acquiescence in Hankey's publication may also have been
influenced by the knowledge that his predecessor, Anthony Eden,
intended to publish a volume of memoirs dealing with his years as
Foreign Secretary from 1951 to 1955 and his short unhappy term as
premier: governmental approval of these memoirs had to precede their
serialization in February i960. It is noteworthy that Eden had chosen to
treat the last years of his career before reverting to the more distant pre-
war and war-time periods, precisely because of their contemporary
significance:' This book will expose wounds; by doing so it could help to
heal them.'^124 Eden acknowledged that he had drawn upon official
materials, specifying personal minutes which he had written to Churchill
or to colleagues when he had become leading minister - apparently
applying the war-time test of authorship of a document - notes dictated as
the basis for messages sent either to England from abroad or directed to
foreign statesmen or British embassies, and occasional notes jotted down
as the opportunity arose. He did not add that since 1954 he had employed
research assistants who had been given access to Cabinet Office records,
which in one striking instance included the ' rough notes' which Hankey
had preserved for the meetings of the Foreign Policy Committee's
meetings in early 1938.^125 Such access to persons other than former
ministers^126 represents a significant if unannounced departure in policy
concerning the preparation of ministerial memoirs: former ministers - or
perhaps former premiers - had secured privileged access for those acting
in their behalf to documents of recent date. Thus an individual with good
reason to plead a special case in a highly politicized event had assured
access to government records long before any of his critics were so armed.
Not surprisingly, the public reaction to Eden's apologia was not long in
coming.

###### When queried in Parliament about Eden's use in his memoirs of

###### House of Commons, but official orthodoxy countered that the release of

###### period. Officially viewed as 'a small body of disgruntled academics,

###### scholars took advantage of the review mechanism built into the Public

###### Records Act of 1958 to organize on behalf of a revision of its terms.

###### Bolstered by the inclusion of some senior figures who had been involved

###### with the Official Histories, academics from the Universities of Oxford,

###### Cambridge, and London met in 1963 to concert their efforts:

###### They were concerned with the whole question of the flow of governmental

###### information to the world of scholarship; and they saw themselves confronted with

###### a threefold task: to persuade government to reduce the closed period; to improve

###### the provision of information by the continuation of the Cabinet Office histories or

###### some similar enterprise within the closed period; and to improve the flow of

###### information given to the public on the immediate issues of politics.^130

###### The Cabinet Office received a deputation, but the Foreign Office and

###### Service Ministries resisted proposals to grant access within the closed

###### period in exchange for an official review of the manuscript. Although on

###### occasion the motives of the Oxford-Cambridge-London group were

###### questioned,^131 Macmillan's retirement weakened official resistance to

Chief Justice judged in a particular case would serve to protect free
discussion within the Cabinet. With this conclusion of the Privy
Counsellors, the matter of ministerial memoirs rests for the moment.
Public access to government records is an entirely different matter, and
the government's decision to reduce the closed period from fifty to thirty
years, announced by Harold Wilson in August 1966, owed something to
the efforts of the Prime Minister himself, as well as to those who set the
stage for the reform. The sole account to date of the Cabinet's reaction is
contained in the Crossman diary: in his view, Wilson strategically
introduced the proposal as ' a filler' in the last Cabinet meeting prior to
Parliament's summer recess, and he carried the case with minimal
support from three ministers, against substantial opposition voiced by
the Chancellor and the Foreign Secretary. Taking our source at his word,
the recent disclosures of affairs of state by former ministers logically
dictated earlier access to records by non-official persons:
I [Crossman] pointed out that the present ban, quite apart from all its other
drawbacks, was rendered intolerable by the permission which a Cabinet Minister,
particularly a Prime Minister, can obtain to use official documents denied to
academic and objective historians for writing his memoirs. If we are going to go
on exercising the right to turn out memoirs which are often nothing but powerful
plaidoyers, there is a powerful case for letting the historians get at the documents
as soon as possible.^134

Wilson sought the Cabinet's agreement to this ' modest reform' only after
he had secured the support of the Leader of the Opposition and the leader
of the Liberal Party; the matter had already been considered by a
parliamentary Advisory Committee on Public Records, which had
reported in favor of a forty-year rule.^135
In his own quest for a twenty-five year rule, Wilson sought to counter
the criticism of any reduction in the closed period, namely the dangers of
premature revelation:' Speaking for myself, I said I would rather be alive
to hit back at all who would in the seventies wish to savage my infant
documents of 1947-51.'^136 Characteristically taking a personal position
on a much-debated matter, Wilson agreed to compromise upon a thirty-
year rule, although he had to threaten to ' thresh out' the matter with the
electorate if the Opposition refused to agree. His account of the Cabinet's
reaction to his proposals eschews the actual discussion - as his memoirs
generally mask such proceedings - and thus fails to reveal that a number of
his own colleagues were not enthusiastic about the reform. For his part,
the Opposition Leader, Edward Heath, attacked the government's
unwillingness to grant the press freer access to the Cabinet's on-going
discussion of various options in the conduct of foreign, defence, and
domestic policies.^137 To raise the matter is one thing, to settle it another;
since 1966 governments have honored the principle that more can


###### 298 A man and an institution

###### responsibly be done to inform the public, but little progress is apparent in

###### practice: the need for administrative secrecy - not simply at the Cabinet

###### level - conflicts with the 'right to know'. At that time, Wilson also

###### announced the government's intention to commission official Cabinet

###### Office histories for the post-war period and to extend Documents on

###### British Foreign Policy^138 into that era, but he cautioned that such works

###### ' would not necessarily be suitable for publication before the expiry of the

###### closed period.'^139 Nonetheless, the Labour premier stressed the import-

###### ance of 'personal recollection' of those involved in the post-war events,

###### which indicates a disparity in viewpoint from those who saw the major

###### importance of such publications the provision of official information at a

###### time when the records themselves were closed.^140 Thus frustrated with

###### regard to several of its goals, the Oxford-Cambridge-London group

###### could take satisfaction in Wilson's amendment of the Public Records Act

###### of 1958, which reduced the closed period to thirty years.

###### Wilson's remarks to the House of Commons establish his own belief

###### that the balance of conflicting claims had at last been righted, because the

###### reform 'would let some light and air into our public records without in

###### any way weakening the conventions which regulate the conduct of public

###### affairs in this country.'^141 He was pressed from his own back benches to

###### admit that such a measure carried 'political mercy to extravagant

###### lengths ':^142 though Suez remained a sore point, a' thirty-year rule' would

###### exclude from inspection documents relating to Munich! The premier

###### retorted that a two-year wait was worth the general protection that the

###### rule afforded those who joined the Cabinet early in their political lives. As

###### for Suez, he had on the previous day personally characterized the British

###### intervention as a 'put-up job,' but Wilson acknowledged that his

###### suspicions were not based on official information:' In accordance with the

###### accepted convention in these matters, the Government can have no

###### knowledge of any engagement of this kind which may have been made by

###### a previous administration but which, in the nature of things, can no

###### longer be valid or operative.'^143

###### The historical and journalistic world generally viewed Wilson's

###### measure as progressive, although several criticisms were offered. One

###### commentary centered on the relationship between what the Wilson

###### government had given and what had been held back:' The price of twenty

###### years relaxation is to be apparently a resolute denial of all access within

###### the closed period,' as individual scholars would be denied special

###### authority to work on current topics.^144 This anonymous correspondent

###### lamented the government's implicit refusal to engage in the selection of

###### such scholars, but he did not advance criteria by which the process might

###### fairly work. As well, he contended that HMG had burked a basic issue:

###### ' the onus is on officialdom to show reason for its secrecy, that other things

```
being equal the public has a right to know.' Much more was to be heard
along these lines in years to come. Similar sentiments were expressed by
Hugh Thomas, who objected to a ' thirty-year rule' as a binding measure
of the relationship between administrative secrecy and scholarly inquiry:
that period could safely be halved, he argued, except for certain
exceptions in which a burden of proof would be put upon HMG to
sustain restriction for a period longer than fifteen years; he suggested that
a tribunal be established to hear the Cabinet's plea for an extension of
closure, or an individual's petition to see documents within the closed
period, 'once action upon a particular matter was complete.'^145 He saw
the immediate effect as entirely beneficial, for the Civil Service and
HMG:

It would somewhat damage the old concept of the silent, neutral and politically
uncommitted machine. But it would nevertheless admit the reality that public
servants are in fact men like the rest of us, with prejudices and policies no less real
if not always overt or realised: for and against the Common Market, for Israel and
against the Arabs as the case may be.

While the likes of Hankey and Tom Jones - or for that matter, Fisher and
Vansittart - underscore the validity of Thomas' point, his proposal defied
both the reality of the Cabinet Office's intention to protect the
ministerial-adviser relationship and its determination to maintain the
impartial reputation of the Civil Service. Curiously, Thomas had himself
discovered evidence pointing to that preoccupation with the image of a
'silent, neutral and politically uncommitted machine.'
Such an observation had arisen in connection with the 1967 publi-
cation of memoirs in the form of an insider's account of the Suez debacle.
Anthony Nutting, a Minister of State for Foreign Affairs at that time, had
broken ten years of silence to castigate Eden's government for collusion
with France and Israel in those events. Although Nutting had resigned
both from the government and the House of Commons, he had declined
in 1956 to make a statement concerning the former, despite established
practices which enabled him to secure permission to do so. A decade later,
he explained: 'Either I had to tell the whole story as I saw it, or say
nothing at all,' adding that only the latter course was open as long as any
of the major protagonists continued to hold high public office. Yet it was
essential that he contribute his version:

Due to the intense security provisions taken at the time, only some half a dozen
people in Britain today knew the story as I know it and of this * select' group all but
myself were so involved in the venture that for them to reveal the truth now would
involve an act of confession too mortifying for any man to volunteer.

Coupled with the fact that no British records were kept of the discussions
among Britain, France, and Israel which led to the Israeli attack, Nutting


```
300 A man and an institution
```
```
noted that the result would be that' the historian will find no enlighten-
ment in the archives of the Foreign Office when the official history of
these times comes to be written.'^146 In sum, the time had come for him to
record the truth, as he saw it, lest history be denied an informed
perspective.
Yet Nutting's assertion that he had ' concealed nothing, added nothing
and subtracted nothing, from what [he knew] to have happened'^147
cannot go unchallenged, because of Hugh Thomas' discovery that
Nutting had deliberately masked some details of the British role,
responding to a Cabinet Office diktat. The implications of this insistence
are important for an understanding of practices involving ministerial
memoirs, provided Thomas' information is correct:
Scorning the usual procedure ... he [Nutting] neither asked for access to
documents which he worked with or prepared at the time, nor submitted his
manuscript to the Cabinet Office (the normal procedure in instances such as this).
He did, however, eventually submit the book in the form of page proof to the
Cabinet Office. The text turned out to have a number of descriptions of Cabinet
and other ministerial meetings, conversations between himself and the then
Foreign Secretary and some mention of the Foreign Office telegrams. The
substantial section of the book was published. The Cabinet Office did however
remove the names of the civil servants involved, the exact definition of whether
such a piece of information was conveyed by word of mouth or by telegram. The
Cabinet Office machine looked after the Civil Service and the structure of
Government, while the politicians concerned, Lord Avon and Mr. Selwyn Lloyd,
in particular, were permitted to be castigated mercilessly.
```
Of course, these men were themselves free to account for their own
actions, as Eden long since had; civil servants were not. Yet such
ministerial disclosures confounded the Official Secrets Act, unless former
ministers were free to determine when and to whom they may com-
municate official information. As Hugh Thomas doubted that license, he
concluded that' the Acts are not made to apply to politicians, providing
they accept the strictures of the Civil Service by the channel of the Cabinet
Office.'^148 Thus Hankey's successors had narrowed their sights in
'vetting' ministerial memoirs: their concern for the 'structure of
government' had already been evidenced by the Cabinet Office's
professed hope to review John Mackintosh's historical survey of modern
Cabinet government.^149 Resident abroad at the time, Mackintosh - who
had been given access to official materials which he thought worthless -
resisted official importuning and published without review, although he
recognized Cabinet Office objections to his listing the Cabinet's standing
committees.^150
Such a modus operandi left the way open to the former leaders of
Britain's post-war governments to recount their experiences for posterity

- and for profit, however deserved.^151 Despite the outcries from Labour


```
The custody of Cabinet secrecy 301
```
back-benchers that the 'thirty-year rule' ought to apply to the use of
public records by former ministers,^152 Harold Wilson - far from
eschewing a' double standard' - used the leisure of imposed absence from
Downing Street to write a massive one volume account of his 1964-70
administration, surely drawing upon official records but veiled as A
Personal Record. Obviously Wilson did not lack precedents, as Harold
Macmillan had already followed in the multi-volume tradition of his
Tory predecessors Churchill, who wrote only of the war years, and
Anthony Eden. Among erstwhile premiers reconciled to life elsewhere
than at No. 10 only Edward Heath and James Callaghan remain yet to be
heard from; certainly Clement Attlee and Sir Alec Douglas-Home
avoided detailed records, although the former sat for interviews which
contain information on Cabinet controversies and criticisms of col-
leagues.^153 Nor have most former ministers shied from reflecting upon ' a
job well done' at whatever departments they have headed: a procession of
ministerial memoirs have revealed in varying degrees the inner workings
of Cabinet government. Until recently, the leading contributor was Hugh
Dalton, whose account of the Labour Cabinet from 1945 to 1950 drew
heavily upon a diary - although with caution because of what could be
generously described as his outspokenness in the diary. In publishing that
volume in 1962, Dalton advised his readers that he intended to write
frankly about colleagues and policies: 'When in doubt, publish.'^154
Though few former ministers have written with Dalton's information
and verve, generally the ' structure of government' has come into clearer
focus, although the distortion of personality is difficult to disengage. It
appears that only disinclination or an early death, as is the case on the one
hand with Aneurin Bevan,^155 or on the other hand Iain Macleod or
Anthony Crosland, inhibits the practice. While the Cabinet Office has
sought to discourage discussion of the roles of civil servants, the Wilson
regime grappled with the greater question of premature or excessive
disclosure in ministerial memoirs: we are told that a Cabinet committee
discussed the possibility of some form of mandatory censorship, although
these discussions 'came to nothing.'^156 Clearly the leading figures of that
regime took no self-denying ordinance, as the Prime Minister and his
Foreign Secretary, George Brown, proved quick off the memoirist's
mark.^157 Confidants of the Wilson administration soon brought 'inside,'
if not official, knowledge to the public. Harold Wilson's long-term
Private Secretary, Marcia Williams, penned memoirs sympathetic from
the perspective of Inside Number 10; her account is revealing of the strife
between Wilson's political staff and the civil servants, a dimension of the
'structure of government' otherwise in the shadows.^158 As the Williams
book suggests, information concerning policies as well as personalities
need not wait upon the publication of ministerial memoirs: active


###### 302 A man and an institution

###### politicians can co-operate with biographers - whether or not the

###### designation 'authorised' is attached - to ensure that their view of recent

###### controversies, well within the closed period, is advanced. Thus no official

###### documents appear to inform the biography of Denis Healey written by

###### Bruce Reed and Geoffrey Williams, but Healey spoke his mind to them

###### about the defence issues which the Wilson government confronted:

###### divisions within the Cabinet over such a matter as the cancellation of the

###### F-i 11, in which Healey fought a losing battle with the Prime Minister,

###### were frankly discussed.^159

###### Similar disclosures about the divisiveness of that government were

###### found in the diary of the publishing magnate, Cecil King, who described

###### his position as 'a seat in the front row of the political stalls.'^160 Yet King

###### was more than an idle observer, as he freely offered his opinions to the

###### Prime Minister, his colleagues, civil servants, and other highly placed

###### officials.^161 The confidences were seemingly mutual, as King was made

###### privy to insider sources: it has been alleged that the anonymous

###### informants masked in his published diaries were Sir William Armstrong,

###### Head of the Civil Service, and Sir Burke Trend, Secretary to the

###### Cabinet.^162 If such confidences are irresponsibly given, the widespread

###### suspicion that the advocates of 'closed government' manipulate secrecy

###### to serve their own ends is reinforced.

###### Of course the latter type of memoir does not command the field in the

###### fashion of ministerial memoirs. Thus the Cabinet Office has taken an

###### interest mainly in the memoirs of former Cabinet ministers, informed

###### military memoirs, those written by former diplomats and members of the

###### Foreign Service, and memoirs written by former members of the Home

###### Civil Service. Military memoirs were relatively full, in large measure

###### because the war period had been treated specially at Churchill's

###### insistence; although HMG had initially favored ministerial disclosures

###### about the war to those penned by their military advisers, the latter had

###### nonetheless related their cases, but as had been the case once before,

###### military memoirs were a 'dying class' in the 1970s. Diplomatic memoirs

###### had assumed a greater scope since the 1950s, when Vansittart, for

###### instance, had worked with restrictions: a number of diaries kept in the

###### inter-war and war period began to see the light of day, and acid

###### observations about contemporaries often color these less-than-

###### diplomatic accounts. Oliver Harvey's War Diaries extended criticism of

###### contemporaries even to the King and Queen, published in her case while

###### she lived.^163 Diplomats are free to review the documents which they had

###### prepared, but they are unable to quote from such documents as fall within

###### the closed period.^164 Treatment of personality is more restrained in

###### memoirs than in diaries; such private records do not fall within the scope

###### of the 'thirty-year rule,' but they are subject to the restrictions


###### The custody of Cabinet secrecy 303

###### enumerated in the Radcliffe report.^165 Whatever the limitations of

###### diplomatic memoirs, we have learned much more from them than from

###### any counterpart records kept within the Home Civil Service, where

###### Cabinet Office influence is strongest. Following upon Jones' revealing

###### Whitehall Diary and Mallaby's From My Level a dearth has ensued, not

###### surprisingly to be sure. Only the future will reveal if any of the

###### functionaries since that time have kept diaries or wish to publish

###### informed memoirs.

###### Among these several categories of memoirs, the major assault upon the

##### maintenance of Cabinet secrecy came from within the Cabinet itself. The

###### quarter ought not have been unexpected, because Richard Crossman,

###### Minister of Housing in Wilson's first administration, had proclaimed - to

###### one and all, it seems - his intention:' All my colleagues knew of the diary I

###### was keeping and of my determination to publish it as soon as possible.

###### Apart from the lawyers, who feather their nests in other ways [than

###### writing memoirs], none of them had any moral objection.'^166 Nonetheless

###### the diary format itself represented a departure from form: ministers had

###### kept diaries, but, as had been the case with Dalton (who, like Hankey,

###### occasionally inserted retrospective commentary) or Macmillan,^167 the

###### diary had been melded into a narrative, and the rougher edges of

###### description could be smoothed either in rewriting or by Cabinet Office

###### review. In addition, diaries had proved consistently more controversial,

###### from the efforts of Hankey and Tom Jones to the disclosures of

###### Alanbrooke on the one hand, and Cadogan and Harvey on the other.

###### Surely it was the intimacy of Crossman's diary which attracted Cabinet

###### Office attention, because his concern with events at the distance of less

###### than a decade was hardly unprecedented. As well, Crossman's diaries

###### included accounts of Cabinet discussions which others had handled

###### obliquely. These aspects led both Harold Wilson and James Callaghan to

###### implore Crossman not to publish his volume for the years 1964-6 until

###### after the next general election. Heath's decision to go to the country in

###### February 1974 thus set the scene for Wilson's return to Downing Street

###### and Crossman's now-posthumous emergence as a diarist. His executors

###### knew that Crossman had been unimpressed with the case against

###### publication: ' Since ex-Cabinet Ministers are entitled to access to secret

###### documents when they publish their memoirs, and rely for their accounts

###### of Cabinet proceedings mainly on memory, how much to publish is not a

###### matter of Government ruling, far less of the Official Secrets Act, but a

###### concern of personal taste and personal conscience.'^168 Possibly the

###### growing hostility towards the Official Secrets Act strengthened

###### Crossman's resolve; personally, he appeared to view the statue with

###### contempt.^169 By the same token, Crossman's attitude had to occasion


###### 304 A man and an institution

###### distaste in Whitehall, since the Cabinet Office was resolved to protect the

###### 'structure of government' from premature exposure. On two occasions

###### during the Wilson administration, the Prime Minister had issued a

###### confidential document detailing procedures prior to the publication of

###### such memoirs which asserted that ' the principle of collective respons-

###### ibility and the obligation not to disclose information acquired whilst

###### holding ministerial office apply to former ministers who are contemplat-

###### ing the publication of material based upon their recollections of the

###### conduct of Cabinet and Cabinet committee business in which they took

###### part.'^170

###### When Lord Chief Justice Widgery heard the government's case to

###### enjoin the publication of Crossman's Cabinet Diaries, he concluded that

###### ministerial understanding of the protection of such information varied

###### and that no legal precedents existed' to define the extent to which Cabinet

###### proceedings should be treated as secret or confidential.'^171 Widgery noted

###### that the practice of 'vetting,' initiated in Hankey's time, was 'almost

###### always' followed a half-century later, and the Cabinet Office in effect

###### waived the 'thirty-year rule' for former ministers, provided that their

###### memoirs passed official muster. Even on such a controversial subject as

###### the Suez expedition, partisan accounts had soon appeared: Eden to the

###### fore, and Macmillan as well; Nutting had registered a dissenting report,

###### under terms laid down by the Cabinet Office. Subsequently Pierson

###### Dixon, Ambassador to the United Nations in 1956, recorded his view that

###### ' we intervened by virtue of no clear and defensible principle, but, what

###### was worse, gave a reason which was generally considered at best a lame

###### excuse, at worst a conspiracy.'^172 Finally, the Foreign Secretary, Selwyn

###### Lloyd, published his defence of British policy centering on Suez: while he

###### defended Britain's motivation and denied knowledge of Israeli military

###### planning, Lloyd's discussion of the intricacies of'collusion' reveals the

###### embarrassment which Britain reaped in its professed design to ' separate

###### the combatants.'^173 Lloyd reported that convention dictated that only he

###### could have access to the documents during the closed period;^174 thus the

###### preferential treatment granted to Eden appears to have lapsed. It would

###### seem idle to deny that these several accounts contained 'official'

###### information on an event well within the closed period.

###### In a letter addressed to Crossman's literary executors, the Cabinet

###### Secretary, Sir John Hunt, coupled this exemption granted in recognition

###### of 'the personal responsibility of individual ministers' with the 'com-

###### plimentary principle' of collective responsibility:

###### the convention which permits former ministers to publish their memoirs is a

###### logical and proper consequence of the second principle [collective responsibility].

###### It reflects a long and honourable tradition of British public life that individuals

###### who have been publicly accountable in their own persons for their acts and


###### The custody of Cabinet secrecy 305

policies are entitled to put their own versions of events on record. But they are
expected to submit their texts to the authorities for clearance. This is not just to
safeguard national security but to ensure that they do not indulge their right to
defend the way in which they have discharged their responsibility to the point at
which they endanger good government and the preservation of the confidentiality
which is necessary to maintain collective responsibility and mutual trust.^175

###### In his own mind, the Cabinet Secretary - who had been sent the ' text' in

###### question - had no doubt that' the volume as a whole is in conflict with the

###### obligation to collective discussion.' Hunt specified the 'very detailed

###### account of Cabinet and Cabinet committee meetings,' but he objected

###### also to the diary's recounting 'many other conversations where the other

###### party would clearly have been reasonably entitled to assume that

###### confidentiality would be preserved in the public interest.' Such convers-

###### ations, we have noted, had been routine in many memoirs, but Sir John

###### was particularly concerned, it appears, with protecting the confidentiality

###### of Crossman's dealings with civil servants, which he feared could

###### seriously affect the whole basis of that relationship.

###### Nor is Hunt's point a specious one, because the temptation to opt for a

###### cautious course in advising ministers on policy or personnel matters

###### would be strong for senior civil servants, if their advice were to be

###### subjected to criticism in diaries or memoirs published only a few years

###### later. Equity too has long been a problem, because civil servants are

###### disbarred from commenting on ministerial actions either within the

###### closed period or as long as they remain in the Service. Given the doctrine

###### of ministerial responsibility, one can conclude that it would be in the

###### interest of the Civil Service if discussion of the relationship were

###### altogether proscribed. Yet while the point tells in favor of such silence for

###### a period of time, ultimately the public interest dictates an acknowledg-

###### ment of the realities of that relationship.

###### The Lord Chief Justice paid close attention to concerns raised on

###### behalf of the Civil Service; he concluded that proscriptions should apply

###### to the disclosure of discussions relating to the promotion or transfer of

###### senior civil servants.^176 He was also acquainted with the fact that the post-

###### war generation of memoirists had by and large protected the anonymity

###### of civil servants - not surprisingly, if such was (as alleged) the price of

###### Cabinet Office approval. Crossman, however, refused to accept the view

###### that civil servants were ' silent, neutral and politically uncommitted,' and

###### he judged that no accurate description of his work as a Cabinet Minister

###### was possible without an account of their role. His very first diary entry

###### dealt with his impressions of the higher civil servants within the ministry

###### and in the minister's Private Office. One of the linchpins of his first

###### volume is a detailed record of his relationship with the Permanent

###### Secretary, Dame Evelyn Sharp, whom he recognized as a formidable,

###### accomplished, and opinionated civil servant:


###### 306 A man and an institution

###### She is rather like Beatrice Webb in her attitude to life, to the Left in the sense of

###### wanting improvement and social justice quite passionately and yet a tremendous

###### patrician and utterly contemptuous and arrogant, regarding local authorities as

###### children which she has to examine and rebuke for their failures. She sees the

###### ordinary human being as incapable of making a sensible decision.^177

###### Obviously Sir John Hunt had not to read far in the Cabinet Diaries to

###### discover the shattering of the confidential relationship between minister

###### and adviser.

###### Although The Sunday Times was willing to delete all critical references

###### to specific civil servants, save the most senior, in the serialized treatment

###### of the memoirs which preceded publication, the Cabinet Secretary

###### refused his sanction. The editors proceeded, claiming that Hunt's rules

###### were unduly restrictive in view of the comments which his predecessor,

###### Sir Burke Trend, had voiced to the Franks Committee, where he had

###### treated the Secretary's role in 'vetting' as the exercise of suasion if a

###### former minister abused collective responsibility: 'if he insists on telling

###### his story in the way that he wants to tell it, there is no more that one could,

###### or I think, should try to do.'^178 Sir John Hunt did not regard that

###### comment as authoritative,^179 but his protagonists reciprocated: the first

###### extract from the Cabinet Diaries was published in The Sunday Times of 26

###### January 1975.

###### In the furor which followed publication, several aspects of the case

###### merit attention. The New Statesman proclaimed a view that Crossman's

###### effort was no different in kind from other ministerial memoirs: the journal

###### succinctly compared Crossman's account of the first Cabinet meeting of

###### had already outlived its usefulness, the Crossman case stands as the coup

###### ' seriously relied upon.' Despite their deep differences, The Sunday Times

###### and the Cabinet Secretary co-operated in the serialization of the diaries,

###### although the journal regarded the latter's judgment as advisory: while

###### which his opinion drew upon in extending the principle of 'con-

###### fidentiality' into affairs of state, but it is germane to note that he

###### recognized and strove to balance two conflicting views of the public

###### interest resides in opening the processes of government so that the

###### governed were fully aware of the decisions taken in their name. Certainly


###### 308 A man and an institution

###### the recognition of a concept of the public interest different from that

###### which HMG had traditionally invoked to mask the 'structure of

###### government' represented progress for those who looked to a more ' open'

###### balance the two principles?

###### Yet the Cabinet Diaries did not pose a daunting problem:' I am far from

###### convinced/ he wrote, 'that he [the Attorney-General] has made out a

case that the public interest requires such a Draconian remedy when due

###### Sympathetic to the need for 'confidentiality' within the Cabinet, the

###### Lord Chief Justice saw Cabinet secrecy not as an absolute but a relative

matter:' Some secrets require a high degree of protection for a short time.

###### Others may require protection until a new political generation has taken

###### over.' Thus there could be no 'single rule of thumb' for Cabinet papers

###### and discussions alike. The Crossman case, or any other, required

###### settlement with respect both to general principles and specific impact.

###### Those principles he intertwined with the discussion of his findings in the

Crossman case:

###### 1. In my judgment the Attorney General has made out his claim that the

###### expression of individual opinions by Cabinet ministers in the course of

Cabinet discussion are matters of confidence, the publication of which can be

###### restrained by the court when this is clearly necessary in the public interest.

2. The maintenance of the doctrine of joint [collective] responsibility within the
    Cabinet is in the public interest, and the application of that doctrine might be

###### prejudiced by premature disclosure of the views of individual ministers.

3. There must, however, be a limit in time after which the confidential character
    of the information, and the duty of the court to restrain publication, will lapse
    ... It may, of course, be difficult, in a particular case, to say at what point the
    material loses its confidential character, on the ground that publication will no

###### longer undermine the doctrine of joint Cabinet responsibility. It is this

```
difficulty which prompts some to argue that Cabinet discussions should retain
their confidential character for a long and arbitrary period such as 30 years, or
even for all time, but this seems to be excessively restrictive. The court should
intervene only in the clearest of cases where the continuing confidentiality of
the material can be demonstrated. In less clear cases reliance must be placed on
```
###### the good sense and good taste of the minister or ex-minister concerned.

###### 4. ... A minister is, no doubt, responsible for his department and accountable

###### for its errors even though the individual fault is to be found in his

###### subordinates. In these circumstances to disclose the fault of the subordinate

##### may amount to cowardice or bad taste, but I can find no ground for saying that

either the Crown or the individual civil servant has an enforceable right to have

###### the advice which he gives treated as confidential for all time.^186

##### In the Crossman case, the ' limit in time' had been reached and passed,

###### Widgery concluded: ten years and three general elections had intervened,

##### and the weight of the evidence ' had not satisfied me that publication

###### would in any way inhibit free and open discussion in Cabinet hereafter.'


```
The custody of Cabinet secrecy 309
```
The way lay open for the publication in full of the first volume of
Crossman's Cabinet Diaries.
As the decision had both given something to and taken something from
both camps, a divided opinion on its merits was to be expected. In any
event, the question of ministerial and civil service accounts subsequently
reverted to a political settlement, with the report of the Radcliffe
Committee charged to investigate the genre. The results of that inquiry
are discussed below, but the residue of the legal settlement of the
Crossman case cannot be forgotten: the Lord Chief Justice had enun-
ciated a concept of the public interest which was not shared by the
government or its senior civil servants. Since the Radcliffe Committee in
its turn did not find legal sanctions appropriate as a means of proscribing
ministerial memoirs which compromised the doctrine of' confidentiality,'
HMG will have to assume the burden of proof if they seek to stem some
future breach; Widgery suggested that such an onus could only be
assumed in the 'clearest of cases.' Similarly, his ruling specified a time
limit for the breaching of the doctrine, and the precedent of a decade in
the Crossman case cannot be ignored. On the other hand, he gave legal
standing to the principle of ' confidentiality' in public affairs, and the
privileged status of civil servants had been confirmed - though the
protection was to be temporally limited.^187
With the publication in full of the first volume of the Cabinet Diaries in
December 1975, a number of senior civil servants whose paths had
crossed with the former Minister of Housing felt the stings of his
criticism; in their behalf, the Tory peer, Lord Hailsham, protested most
tellingly that the volume recorded Crossman's 'constant warfare with,
and distrust of, the Civil Servants who seek to save all Ministers from
their worst faults with varying degrees of success.'^188 The initial reactions
to the Cabinet Diaries are interesting, as reviewer after reviewer shared
with A. J. P. Taylor a disappointment that 'there is not a single line from
Cabinet papers and no revelations of Cabinet secrets other than those
known at the time.'^189 While some Cabinet 'secrets' may be known to
journalists and other informants of the government, surely Crossman
revealed confidences in a degree of specificity which was by no means
common knowledge. Nor were Cabinet secrets the only concern of the
authorities: 'confidentiality' had been upheld in Widgery's opinion,
although he ruled that the need for its protection had lapsed in this case.
Thus a comment of Michael Ratcliffe best depicts Crossman's contri-
bution in this regard rather than as a purveyor of Cabinet' secrets':' They
[the Diaries] will embarrass to greater or lesser degree Crossman's ex-
colleagues in the ministry and every member of the first two Wilson
Cabinets. But they will not tell them anything they did not know at the
time or the rest of us anything that we have not a right to know now.'^190


310 A man and an institution

```
It may well be argued that Crossman thought his Cabinet Diaries a
blow on behalf of ' open government,' as well as against undue Cabinet
secrecy. To be sure Sir John Hunt viewed it as offensive in both regards,
since it exposed the ministerial-adviser relationship and thus com-
promised the 'structure of government.' Yet Crossman's purpose ought
to be noted: 'My ambition,' he had written only two months before his
death, 'was to write a book which fulfilled for our generation the
functions of Bagehot's English Constitution a hundred years ago by
disclosing the secret operations of government, which are concealed by
the thick masses of foliage which we call the myth of democracy. '^191 Prior
to 1964 Crossman had no practical experience in the business of Cabinet
government, and some of his diary observations impress as much for their
naivete as their detail.^192 Both qualities contributed to a day-to-day
revelation of the 'structure of government' quite unlike Bagehot's
approach: Crossman claimed to find evidence to confirm his notion that
Cabinet authority had declined - a Cabinet member, he was not privy to
the workings of inner Cabinet government.^193 With concerns almost
exclusively departmental, Crossman contended that for the duration of
the first Wilson regime, he shared only nominally the Cabinet's collective
responsibility. He noted that the basic decisions were made in Cabinet
committees, although he came to question whether ministerial commit-
tees were themselves decisive, since counterpart committees of per-
manent officials appeared to form a 'rival administration' of civil
servants.^194 The care which contemporary government takes to mask the
committee system^195 indicates the intrusion upon the 'structure of
government' which Crossman's account posed to the Cabinet Office and
HMG.
Sir John Hunt had to be concerned with Crossman's commentary on
yet another portion of that structure, namely the role of the Cabinet
Secretary: his advisory capacity captured Crossman's attention in the
aftermath of Wilson's successful appeal to the country in 1966, as Cabinet
members awaited the decision whether they would be asked to join in the
next government. In contrast, Hunt's predecessor, Sir Burke Trend, sat
with the Prime Minister at 'the centre of power:' 'I wrote in my
Introduction to The English Constitution that the Prime Minister shares
his power with the head of the Civil Service. Certainly, Helsby doesn't
play that kind of role. It's Burke Trend who shares power with Harold,
not the head of the Treasury.'^196 Crossman also challenged the secretarial
role played by Trend, in recording his dissatisfaction with the accuracy of
the minutes kept of Cabinet deliberations; in regard to the Prime
Minister's initiative in revising the 'fifty-year rule,' which it is safe to
infer the Cabinet Office disliked, Crossman alleged that the Secretary's
minute revealed only ' what we should have said if we had done as they
had wished.'^197
```

```
The custody of Cabinet secrecy 311
```
Several years later, at a time when Crossman indicated the tenor of his
criticism of such practices, Harold Wilson protested the thesis that
' Cabinet was controlled by a conspiracy between the prime minister and
the secretary of the Cabinet, who sat down the day after the meeting
virtually to cook the Cabinet Conclusions,' insisting that he personally
had never seen them before circulation and rarely consulted them at all.^198
Crossman freed the premier from the charge of collusion, but he insisted
that the development of 'the decision-drafting technique^5 possibly
constituted 'the great secret of [contemporary] Cabinet Government,'
explaining:' Sometimes as a member of the Cabinet you don't realise that
you lost the battle; it is not your impression of what happened. But once it
is there, written in the minutes, it has been decided - against you.'
Crossman recognized that minutes were taken not in a verbatim fashion
but instead to depict' the sense of the discussions and of the decisions,'
enabling the Secretariat to alter the substance of decisions in the course of
preparing directives.^199 The problem, as we have seen, is a perennial one,
because clarity of directive is likely to be at odds with the deliberative
process, a point remarked upon in 1953 by Harold Macmillan, who made
light of Cabinet Minutes depicting a group ' so intellectually disciplined
that they argued each issue methodically and logically through to a set of
neat and precise conclusions.'^200 Because the problem is inherent in the
system of recording Conclusions which the Cabinet has traditionally
followed, Crossman's 'discovery' may be routine, although his alleg-
ations of transformation and suppression cut much deeper than the
impact of the practice which we have traced. Ultimately the Cabinet
Minutes of the 1960s and 1970s will have to be tested against the various
ministerial accounts in order to test the validity of Crossman's
allegations.
Questioning the role of the Cabinet Secretary - Wilson remarked
ruefully of Crossman's continuing belief that 'the Cabinet secretary was
capable of doing the necessary cooking of the Minutes without my
help '^201 - was a means for Crossman to inquire generally about the role of
leading civil servants: in a sense, he posed the question, to whom do their
loyalties belong?^202 There is implicit in his work another vital question,
who - after all - governs Britain? Above all else, these questions explain
the hostility which Hankey's latter-day successor showed towards the
publication of Cabinet Diaries.

```
Crossman's volumes must be viewed as a defeat of the Cabinet Office's
excessive claim to defend Cabinet secrecy; however, the faltering in its
control of ministerial memoirs proved to be of short duration, as the
political process restored to the Cabinet Secretary the central role which
Widgery's judicial ruling had compromised. The custodians of Cabinet
secrecy had not been idle while the Cabinet Diaries were subjudice: HMG
```

312 A man and an institution

opened a second front through the appointment of a Committee of Privy
Counsellors on Ministerial Memoirs, chaired by Lord Radcliffe. Charged
with considering the general principles of memoirs written by former
ministers and the means by which these might be implemented, the
seven-man committee, which included a former head of the Home Civil
Service, Lord Armstrong, and Lord Franks, who had chaired the inquiry
into section 2 of the Official Secrets Act, proceeded with unusual dispatch
to complete its report in eight months. In short order, after scrutiny by a
Cabinet committee and the Cabinet, the Prime Minister announced his
government's full acceptance of the report on the day of its publication.^203
Since the announcement came by way of a written reply to a par-
liamentary question, Wilson's government did not solicit any com-
prehensive discussion of the report. The Radcliffe Committee advised
that a special standing be given to ministerial memoirs, subject to certain
conditions; in such a spirit Wilson remarked that the new conventions
'should properly be regarded as concessions made to the [memoir's]
author rather than restrictions imposed upon him.'^204
Certainly the diary of a former Minister of Housing was in the Radcliffe
Committee's mind when they concluded that a prohibition upon keeping
a diary of public affairs would be wrong as well as unrealistic, because
such accounts served legitimate purposes:
The reasons for making them are various and individual: as the mnemonics of
future compositions, as personal experience only to be made public at some
indeterminate future date, and even as an immediate private discharge of the
psychological tensions generated by public office.
It is not the making of a diary which matters; it is the timing of its publication,
particularly when on his death the text is handed in the raw to a man's executors
with the overriding duty of exploiting its value as an asset of his estate.^205
The Radcliffe Committee also concluded that published diaries ought not
to impair the confidential relationships among ministers and between
them and their advisers, despite ' all the pressures of the day in favour of
openness of government and public participation in the formation of
public policies.' Repeatedly they concluded that 'the principle... [of]
confidentiality in all that goes to the internal formulation of Government
policy' was necessary, most compelling of all in the relationship between
statesmen and civil servants:
Indeed the case of the departmental adviser is stronger than any other since it is
his professional duty to tender his advice when so required, and in our view it is
critically important that he should be free to do so in the assurance that the
confidence that he has given will be respected... the minister must observe a
scrupulous reticence with regard to the attitudes and personalities of those who
have served him in office ... It seems to us wholly repugnant that he should at a
later date regard himself as free to record this material and discuss it in the course
of a public account of his Ministerial experience.^206


```
The custody of Cabinet secrecy 313
```
Reticence thus became a 'public duty' for ministers preparing their
memoirs in regard to attitudes expressed by advisers or ministerial
colleagues on matters of government business and also in assessing civil
servants who had served under the minister or whose suitability for other
posts had fallen to him for evaluation: Dame Evelyn Sharp and Sir Burke
Trend had not been pilloried in vain, after all.
Tempting though it is to see in these recommendations a Civil Service
placed beyond criticism, on balance the Radcliffe Committee protected a
legitimate concern which serves the public interest. To legitimize
criticism of senior civil servants, particularly those still active, is to place
them in an invidious position, because they are not free to defend
themselves from the charges brought by former ministers who may
themselves be arrogant, unprincipled, insensitive, or incompetent. Yet
the grant of the freedom of reply to the Civil Service is nowhere seriously
entertained, and thus some other alternative is needed. In the long run,
that alternative is well served by such memoirs as Hankey's, which
incorporated a view of ministerial foibles and fallacies long after the
nature of his relationship with them ceased to matter as a political force.
In the shorter run, the alternative is the type of temporal compromise
incorporated in Widgery's opinion: at some point, the protection afforded
to civil servants must yield to the public's' right to know' how government
is carried on. Both ministers and advisers must then stand scrutiny, in
their recommendations no less than in their interaction. The problem, of
course, is where to draw the line.
Before offering an opinion, the Radcliffe Committee pointed to other
justified restrictions upon ministerial accounts, which ought not en-
danger national security nor damage Britain's relations with other
countries. As no former minister was competent to judge these matters at
the time of proposed publication, there re-emerged the Cabinet Secretary
as custodian of those vital interests; ex-ministers were expected to submit
any manuscript to the Secretary, with a right of appeal to the Prime
Minister. The Radcliffe Committee freed the Cabinet Secretary to
approve such memoirs at any time, provided that national security,
diplomatic relations and the bounds of reticence were not breached.^207 If
confidential relations were exposed, fifteen years would have to pass prior
to publication, although concerns for security and diplomacy might in
some cases merit protection for an even longer period. ' Confidentiality'
would lapse after such a period, except with regard to individuals still in
the public service.^208
Whether or not justifiably, historical concern with the 'structure of
government' was curtly dismissed in the assertion that 'government is
not to be conducted in the interests of history.'^209 Few historians would
dispute a literal reading of such a precept, but such an attitude will do


###### 314 A man and an institution

###### nothing to resolve the anomaly in the form of a 'double standard': while

###### ministers may range across recent history at the remove of fifteen years,

###### and in many cases far less, historians will continue to work with official

###### documents, at the distance of thirty years. As a result, 'insider' accounts

###### will continue to color recent British history. While some historians may

###### press for a contraction of the closed period, not all are confident that such

###### access would facilitate the conduct of government business, which

###### remains the prime concern. In this vein, D. C. Watt has written:' There is

###### a body of historical opinion who feel that access at dates of less than 25

###### years may be purchased too dearly if it results in a distortion or decrease

###### in completeness of the official record as experience suggests may have

###### been the case with some American records.'^210 Since ministerial memoirs

###### within the closed period are now sanctioned by government policy, little

###### is likely to be gained by protesting the 'double standard'; historians

###### would do better to weigh carefully whether the ' thirty-year rule' serves

###### best to balance availability of full and complete records against quicker

###### access. Yet this dilemma ought not deter them from pressing for a fuller

###### flow of information from the government to the public on contemporary

###### issues, although the selection of such materials will remain in the hands of

###### HMG. The two concerns must be differentiated: the public's 'right to

###### know' is separable from the historian's right to investigate the ways in

###### which government policies are made - at a time consistent with the

###### effective functioning of government.

###### The Radcliffe Committee, composed predominantly of' insiders,' did

###### not attempt to portray this conflict of legitimate interests; instead, they

###### chose to regard ' open government' as no more than a descriptive phrase

###### and took refuge in the meaningless assertion that no one seriously thought

###### that every incident in the processes of government ought to be conducted

###### in the open. Perhaps they found solace in the reductio ad absurdum, but

###### the Lord Chief Justice concurrently acknowledged the legitimacy of the

###### 'right to know.' To deny 'open government' a role within the British

###### political process is hardly to serve the ends of twentieth-century

###### government. In accepting the Radcliffe report, HMG struck a particular

###### balance between the contending claims to ' open' and ' closed' models of

###### government: clearly the bias runs towards the latter. Such a preference is

###### defended in the name of effective government and in the implicit

###### recognition that senior civil servants serve as advisers as well as executors

###### of official policy, however hallowed the notion of ministerial respons-

###### ibility. It is precisely in this context that the need for ' confidentiality' has

###### lately won independent standing. The counterclaim of the public's 'right

###### to know' is not about to disappear, and the pressure for earlier release of

###### official documents is likely to persist, since principle is involved no less

###### than timing. The point was well put by a leading article, critical of the


```

```
Radcliffe report, published in New Law Journal: 'Anyone who claims to
accept that public discussion about the major matters of national
importance has a place in political life at all is being totally insincere if he
suggests that material that is relevant to such discussion should be kept
from the public until it is no longer a matter of contemporary interest.'^211
Of course, HMG need not breach ' confidentiality' in order to improve
public access to materials which would inform the contemporary debate.
For that reason, the balance between opposing concepts of the public
interest deserves a more careful evaluation than it received at the hands of
the Radcliffe Committee.
In fact, it is another ministerial publication which has called into
question the official hope that discussion of the role of civil servants could
be virtually eschewed. In the quest for 'confidentiality,' the Privy
Counsellors concluded that a fifteen year period would serve to protect all
ministerial relations save that with their advisers, who needed such
protection as long as they remained in the Civil Service. Indeed, they
characterized these ' obligations of reticence' as ' public duties' binding
upon all former ministers. They acknowledged that legal mechanisms
were inappropriate for the protection of 'confidentiality'; here, at least,
the lesson of the Crossman case was clear. Thus the obligation was cast in
moral terms, although it was to be reinforced by a rule that upon or
leaving office a minister should have his attention explicitly called to this
duty. Ministers also would be instructed to leave testamentary instruc-
tions that any posthumous publication of their private records of Cabinet
business ought not flout the understanding which they had thus accepted.
Even if the undertaking were not universally honored, the Radcliffe
Committee concluded that the new obligation could withstand an
occasional breach.
Such a breach is much in evidence in the recent publication by
Crossman's colleague and friend, Barbara Castle, who published her own
Cabinet diary at a remove of but a half-decade from the events described
in copious detail. Her account gives every appearance of lifting the
curtains of 'confidentiality' from her dealings alike with civil servants
and ministers, within and without the Cabinet room. By no means as
critical of civil servants as Crossman - indeed she is protective of the
reputations of her own departmental advisers - Castle's description of the
views of her associates shattered the bounds of reticence proposed by the
Radcliffe Committee, whose report she viewed from the first with
scorn.^212
Time is required to test the hope that those who accepted the new
convention upon entering the Cabinet will honor its terms, but it is
difficult to conclude that those who feel that the public interest is served
by bringing the processes of late twentieth-century government into


316 A man and an institution

clearer focus through such accounts will be either impressed or restrained
by the claims made in the name of 'confidentiality.' Agreement even
among 'men or women who ex hypothesi have held high office under the
Crown and responsible positions in public life'^213 may not prevail if
ministers conclude that higher principles are at stake. Nor is the
convention likely to deter those few former ministers alert to exploit the
value of such accounts while issues are fresh in the public mind. The
recommendations of the Privy Counsellors, experienced men all, will
undergo the test of practice in years to come.
In the meantime, HMG derived satisfaction from the report of official
memoirs: the Attorney-General who had witnessed Widgery's rejection
of portions of his argument concluded that' if the Lord Chief Justice had
taken the 15-year period which Radcliffe has taken, the action [to enjoin
publication] would have succeeded in toto instead of merely, as now,
establishing the principle I was contending for.'^214 Whatever the degree
of the present disposition to 'closed government' on the part of those who
govern Britain - politicians and civil servants alike - portions of the
public are not about to yield their 'right to know' more about the
government carried on in their behalf.

To this point, then, the study of a man and an institution has brought us:
the career of Sir Maurice Hankey has served as connective tissue, linking
his role as first Cabinet Secretary to the development of that agency of
Cabinet government, and relating the systematized procedures for the
maintenance of its records to the question of the right of public access to
those materials. By a strange irony, Hankey's own difficulties in securing
governmental assent for the publication of his war memoirs were rooted
in the restrictive decisions taken twenty years earlier by the National
Government, at Hankey's own urging. In the conflict between ad-
ministrative concern for 'closed government' and the public's claim to
the 'right to know,' the relevant historical context is Hankey's manipu-
lation of the Official Secrets Act and, in turn, the barrier which that
legislation posed to his own memoirs and those of others. In tracing the
Cabinet Office's role as custodian of Cabinet records, and in noting the
license given to former Cabinet ministers to write about their experiences
in office before the records were made available, we have moved well
beyond Hankey's retirement in 1938. Thereafter his efforts to obtain
HMG's approval for the publication of The Supreme Command,
1914-19/ 8 shed a unique light upon the question of the 'confidential'
relationship between ministers and their civil service advisers. The
custody of Cabinet secrecy has proved to be a complex task, in which the
Cabinet Office has, understandably, opted for precepts of 'closed
government.' Yet progress towards a more 'open' model has been


```
The custody of Cabinet secrecy 317
```
reflected in the legislative initiatives of 1958 and 1967, which have served
to secure public access to Cabinet records on a systematic basis; judicial
intervention in the process has lately played a part as well.
We have attempted here no characterization of the role of the present-
day Cabinet Office, save in its capacity as watch-dog of Cabinet secrecy,
in which regard some information - though not the records themselves -
has fortuitously become available. What has been related, for the first
time in a comprehensive political and institutional setting, is the
development of the Cabinet Secretariat between 1916 and 1938, as that
body assumed a number of functions related to the business of the
modern Cabinet. Though one moves into the post-Second World War
era with less confidence, one can infer a substantial measure of continuity
in the operations of the Cabinet Office, an institutional continuity, bridged
to be sure by the War Cabinet Secretariat, which is likely to be confirmed
as the relevant documents are released. Nonetheless, Hankey's own
departure from Whitehall Gardens, barely a year before the outbreak of
that war, serves to demarcate a lengthy, indeed decisive, period in the
development of the Secretariat: decisive precisely because the roots
planted by the Lloyd George regime proved deeper and more enduring
than most of his war-time reforms.
Where his successors differed from Hankey lay in the type and style of
the undoubted influence which the first Cabinet Secretary exerted in
dealing with his political masters. Though Hankey typically resorted to
an 'indirect approach' his influence has been assessed in this account,
because he left a personal record in the form of a diary which supplements
the official papers which his office was charged with collecting. In view of
the stated opposition of his successors to the maintenance of such a
personal record, it is unlikely that 'insider' accounts will in future
emanate from the Cabinet Office. Insofar as the valuable private diaries of
Hankey and Tom Jones are concerned, the precedent is now that such
diaries ought not be kept by the confidants of ministers. Even if the
contention that since Hankey's time the work of the Cabinet Office has
been regularized is ultimately sustained by Cabinet records, the loss of
such informed sources will prove a matter for historical regret: the
development of a prime ministerial personal cabinet within No. 10
Downing Street, initiated by Harold Wilson in 1974 and continued by his
successors, Labour and Conservative alike, is an aspect of modern
Cabinet government which would be well served by such unofficial
commentary.^215
Another significant question concerns the particular role of the
Secretary to the Cabinet, especially the manner and import of his
influence; without a personal record, his manner of exerting influence will
not yield readily to analysis. Yet the question of his influence among


###### 318 A man and an institution

###### ministers and upon the form of the Cabinet Minutes remains a vital one.

INTRODUCTION
1 For that argument, Michael Davie, 'Notebook,' The Observer, 14 November
1976.
2 The suggestion that, with one possible exception, the 'Cabinet diary^5
approach of Crossman and Barbara Castle has exhausted itself within the
ranks of the several Labour regimes led by Harold Wilson is implicit in a
review of Castle's volume for 1974-6 by Michael Foot ('"To set diary
against diary is to spread endless misapprehension,'" The Listener, 104:
386-8; 25 September 1980), who himself takes a decidedly negative view of
the practice. What the future will bring from former Conservative ministers
only time, and the suasion of 'confidentiality,' will tell.

26 Quoted by Roy Jenkins, Asquith (London, 1963), p. 429; Asquith to Lloyd
George, 1 December 1916. The premier's claim to 'excellent work' despite
these structural defects impresses as disingenuous.
27 Frances Stevenson, The Years that are Past (London, 1967), p. 84, illustrates
from a partisan recollection of the last Cabinet prior to Asquith's resignation:
'There are three different versions, so Ministers said, of what had been the
decision upon a debate (in the Cabinet) on the Air Ministry. And nothing was
definitely decided.'

##### Notes to pages 13-16 321

28 Accounts by Hazlehurst and Peter Lowe, 'The Rise to the Premiership,
1914-1916,' in Lloyd George: Twelve Essays, ed. A. J. P. Taylor (New York,
1971), serve to convince that, in Lowe's words, 'paradoxically, Lloyd
George achieved the office of prime minister, long the ultimate object of his
ambition, at a time when he did not want or expect to achieve it' (p. 95).
29 Hankey Diary, 9 November 1916. Hankey put Law's words in direct
quotation, because they indicated a 'very precarious' political situation.
30 Quoted by Lloyd George, War Memoirs, vol. I (Boston, 1933), p. 587;
memorandum submitted by Lloyd George, Bonar Law, Sir Edward Carson
and Sir Max Aitken, 1 December 1916.
31 Lowe, 'Rise to the Premiership,' p. 124.
32 The alternative is only fleetingly suggested in Lloyd George's response to a
suggestion voiced on 25 November by Frances Stevenson, expressing her
preference for a' smash-up': 'D[avid] says that Derby is of the same opinion.
I think D. has his doubts about it too.' (Lloyd George: A Diary, p. 128.)
33 Scott Diaries, p. 245; 4 December 1916. Fisher's judgment was proved
incorrect, as Hankey was to 'transfer' his loyalties on eight occasions
involving six premiers; Fisher thought that Hankey had on an earlier
occasion 'sold him out' in order to protect Asquith. Scott conveyed the
sentiment to Lloyd George.
34 Hankey Diary, respectively 3 and 2 December 1916; yet only weeks earlier
Hankey had thought that a dictatorship might be Britain's only way out.
35 For a succinct description of Asquith's reversal of position, see Morgan, Age
of Lloyd George, p. 66. The article in question did not differ in kind from the
press campaign mounted against Asquith's policy of 'drift'; see Churchill,
Derby, p. 222.
36 The phrase is adapted from R. Rhodes James, who concluded his Tory-
derived view of these events: 'It was Asquith who deposed Asquith.'
(Memoirs of a Conservative:. J. C. C. Davidson's Memoirs and Papers,
1910-1937, ed. R. Rhodes James (London, 1969), p. 43.)
37 Quoted by Lockwood, 'Milner's Entry,' p. 129; the underscoring is likely
Milner's.
38 Hankey Diary, 10 December 1916. Unfortunately, if understandably,
Hankey's diary had lapsed after 4 December 'owing to the great pressure of
work' and the entry of 10 December is of a summary nature.
39 Respectively 23 HL Debates, 10 December 1916, col. 922 and 30 HL Debates,
19 June 1918, col. 265. The latter comment certainly exaggerated the
immediacy of change, which came very hard indeed.
40 Hankey Diary, 3 December 1917.
41 Ibid., 10 December 1916. Milner's surprising appointment may be paftly
explained by Lloyd George's desire to exclude Sir Edward Carson, but the
once-bitter political opponents had come to share a number of ideas about
the war effort.
42 Thomas Jones Papers (National Library of Wales, Aberystwyth), Class Z:
Printed Diaries, 1899-1937, 10 December 1916. The unsuccessful aspirant
was David Davies, a mine-owner and Liberal MP, who served instead as
Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Prime Minister, 1916-17.
43 Richard Crossman, 'Introduction' to Walter Bagehot, The English Consti-
tution (London, pb. edn, 1963), p. 48, noting that 'Cabinet government of
the classical type lasted far longer into this century than the parliamentary
system to which it was linked.' Cf. the dissenting view, not shared here, of

Guardian^ 15 June 1922; Private Secretary of Lord Hartington to Sir Edward
Hamilton, 6 July 1882. Although Bright withheld his threatened resignation
another ten days, Hamilton's diary for 7 July confirms the Cabinet's deep
disagreements: 'We have been living at the mouth of volcanoes again this
week. Crises on Egypt. Crises on Ireland.' {Hamilton Diary, vol. I, p. 298.)
Yet his entry is clear on the Cabinet deliberations and likely he straightened
out the confusion from his own record.
58 Philip Snowden, An Autobiography (2 vols., London, 1934), vol. II, p. 620;
the 1882 episode had been cited in the House of Lords as recently as 21
December 1932.
59 Quoted by Zara S. Steiner, The Foreign Office and Foreign Policy, 1898—1914
(Cambridge, 1969), p. 25; Lansdowne to Balfour, 24 April 1900. Curiously,
Devonshire, then the Marquess of Hartington, had been involved in the 1882
episode.
60 Quoted by Hankey, Diplomacy by Conference, pp. 63-4; Lord John Manners
to Queen Victoria, 4 December 1877. He cites nearly a dozen instances to
reinforce Derby's observation; for the unnecessary resignations, see
pp. 68-9.
61 British Museum Add. MSS. 49703, the Balfour Papers, vol. XXI; Hankey to

63 Hankey, Supreme Command, vol. I, pp. 156-7: as the War Office was prompt
in acting, its warning was received in some departments long before the
Cabinet minister in charge of the department had taken the trouble to inform
his subordinates.
64 30 HL Debates, 19 June 1918, col. 253; cf. the recollections of two defenders
of the old ways, which fail to sustain Wilson's contention that 'Curzon may
have been over-stressing the weaknesses' (Cabinet Office, p. 27 and Annex 1).

(Cabinet Paper) 30 (24).
66 HNKY 13/7, enclosure, 'Cabinet Procedure before 1916,' August 1949, in
Norman Brook to Hankey, 24 October 1949. The inquiry, undertaken at
Brook's request by N. H. Gibbs, had proved less than conclusive and the
Cabinet Secretary had appealed to Hankey 'to fill in the gaps'; Hankey
retorted that such could not be done, because the old ways were shot through
with gaps. (Ibid., Aide Memoire.)
67 Quoted by Fraser, Esher, p. 169, from the Royal Archives, R 26/41, 23 June
1905- an extraordinary comment on the old system. Austen Chamberlain
was Chancellor of the Exchequer at the time.

72 Ibid., p. 493-
73 Gibbs, Origins, p. 20. In 1904 Balfour asserted that no one save the Prime
Minister attended the CID meetings as a matter of right, a position which
preserved its independent status from the Service ministers.
74 That part-timer, William Tyrrell, subsequently became Permanent Under-
secretary at the Foreign Office, 1925-8.

76 Nicholas d'Ombrain, War Machinery and High Policy: Defence Administ-
ration in Peacetime Britain, 1902-1914 (London, 1973), p. 40. In 1904 two
Assistant Secretaries, military and naval, were appointed.
77 Balfour once more moved very cautiously: d'Ombrain (ibid., pp. 40-5)
remarks that the title 'Secretariat' was 'calculated to give the least offence
and maximum assurance to those who feared for the constitution and the
continued responsibility of the military departments of state.'
78 Quoted by Gibbs, Origins, p. 22; see also Fraser, Esher, p. 176.
79 Quoted by Fraser, ibid., p. 23.
80 Steiner, Foreign Office, pp. 76-82, for a description of the reforms which' did
push the office into the twentieth century.'
81 Mackintosh, 'Imperial Defence,' pp.494-5.
82 Ibid., p. 496, a conclusion stated in stronger terms by d'Ombrain:' There was
no agreement between the departments over policy, and throughout these
years the CID was wholly ignored by both the naval and military planners.'
(War Machinery, p. 90.)
83 One CID sub-committee 'heard the only mention of the "conversations"
ever made to any organ of the CID made prior to 1911.' (Ibid, p. 96.) Of
course only a handful in the Cabinet were aware of the ' conversations' prior
to that time.
84 Quoted by Mackintosh, 'Imperial Defence,' p. 500; Haldane to Spender.
85 d'Ombrain, War Machinery, pp. 22-3, adds that the CID's existence served
to mask' the crucial divergence between the military policy of a " Continental
strategy" and the contradictory one based on the amphibious capability that
was inherent in the small professional army of an island empire built upon sea
power.'
86 On the War Book, see Hankey, Supreme Command, vol. I, pp. 118-23,155-7
and also Roskill, Hankey, vol. I, pp. 107-8 and 136—8. Hankey reflected in
1918: 'I built up, almost entirely by my own initiative, the system of
preparation incorporated in the War Book, by which I would be willing to
stand or fall before any tribunal on earth or in heaven.' (Diary, 19 July.)
87 Mackintosh, 'Imperial Defence,' p. 500. Cf. views that the question of
sending an expeditionary force to the continent was an open one, including
Hankey's own, and that of Hazlehurst, Politicians at War, p. 80.
88 The two views are recounted by Mackintosh, 'Imperial Defence,' p. 502.
89 Fraser, Esher, p. 260.
90 Asquith's method was 'to run the war by compartments, and by holding
scratch conventions of available ministers at moments of crisis.' (Ibid.,
p. 266.)
91 Thus Mackintosh's characterization of the 'relative failure' of the pre-war
CID ('Imperial Defence,' p. 503) is more convincing than d'Ombrain's
concept of ' the true measure of the failure of the Committee of Imperial
Defence.' (War Machinery, p. 273.) Any 'true measure' must be applied at
the highest level, namely the Cabinet.

92 d'Ombrain, War Machinery, pp. 14-15, for a description of Ottley's tenure:
' He was there to appease the dissenters [in strategic concerns] and to smooth
ruffled feathers, while at the same time endeavouring to keep the CID ticking
over.'
93 These phrases are used, ibid., pp. 14-22; yet d'Ombrain does not convince
that these activities transformed the criteria by which Ottley had steered the
CID into 'a religion of detachment.'
94 Such a description, derived from Hankey's assertions, is applied to this
period by Franklyn Johnson, Defence by Committee: The British Committee of
Imperial Defence, 1883-1959 (London, i960). A pioneering effort, the book
is handicapped both by a lack of official papers for the years after 1902 and by
Hankey's spoon-feeding; it must be regarded as obsolete.
95 After his government's resignation in 1905, Balfour did not sit with the CID
but he did co-operate with its staff and sit on one of its sub-committees.
(d'Ombrain, War Machinery, p. 129.) On several extraordinary occasions in
the inter-war period. Opposition leaders attended CID meetings. (Wilson,
Cabinet Office, p. 69.)
96 Roskill, Hankey, vol. I, pp. 84-6; one must now treat as apocryphal Lord
Ismay's recounting of a letter which Fisher wrote in 1906, extolling Hankey's
virtues {The Memoirs of General Lord Ismay (New York, i960), p. 43),
although from 1911 his enthusiasm knew no bounds, e.g. 'He is Napoleonic
in his ideas and Cromwellian in his thoroughness!' (Hankey Diary, 19 July
1918, printed by Roskill, Hankey, vol. I, p. 578; Fisher to Col. Seeley, 27
February 1912.)
97 Quoted, Roskill, Hankey, vol.1, p. 112; Hankey to Adeline Hankey, 19
February 1912. This contemporary description differs from his recollections
incorporated in Supreme Command, vol. I, pp. 54-5, in which he wrote that
his reference to Haldane's achievements was 'a shot in the dark, for I did not
know the facts.' The contemporary version is preferable.
98 For the range of reactions, Roskill, Hankey, vol. I, p. 116; for the standing of
his predecessors, d'Ombrain, War Machinery, pp. 187-202.
99 See below, pp. 46-7. d'Ombrain (ibid., p. ix) does not exaggerate in
commenting that 'CID's failure to entrench itself as the decision-maker of

1916. Earlier in the year, Hankey, hearing of Amery's intrigues against the
Asquith government, suggested to the Prime Minister that he should be sent
'to Salonica or somewhere equally salubrious.' (Quoted by Roskill, Hankey<,
vol. I, p. 270). Whatever the cause, in May 1916 the CIGS attached Amery to
the staff of the Salonica army. His return to Whitehall thus came as a
particular irony to Hankey.

117 While Jones was closer to the premier than were his colleagues, his
description of the process of 'cutting in' a post-Cabinet discussion is
illustrative. {Whitehall Diary, vol. I, p. 20; letter to Eirene Jones, 12 January
1917.)

120 That Lloyd George had little if any hope upon assuming office that the
soldiers would change their views is clear in Hankey's noting on 10
December that the premier was 'awfully down on Robertson.' (Hankey
Diary.) Perhaps it was this recognition which led Lloyd George to comment
to Hankey about his new post: ' You are shaking the hand of the unhappiest
man on earth.' (HNKY 8/35, undated.)

exaggerates in placing Milner in 'second position' under the Crown; Bonar
Law claimed that distinction for the war's duration. And Roskill {Hankey,
vol. I, p. 337) misconstrued the situation in claiming that Lloyd George
delegated to Milner the responsibility of 'handling' the Secretariat's
problems on behalf of the War Cabinet; at most he asked that body 'to think

125 In the words of a moderate pro-Milnerite: Gollin, Proconsul, p. 375.
126 Quoted, ibid.> pp. 377-8; Milner to Prime Minister, 14 December 1916.
127 To clinch his case, Hankey remarked that the Under Secretary for the
Colonies was nowhere popular, including the House of Commons, and 'a
tactless man in my office is grit in the machine.' Exercising tact, he
recommended either Edwin Montagu or Mark Sykes in lieu of Steel Maitland.
(Lloyd George Papers, F/21/2/2, Hankey to Prime Minister, 14 December
1916.)
128 Quoted by Roskill, Hankey, vol. I, p. 345; Hankey to Adeline Hankey, 13
December 1916.
129 Hankey Diary, 12 January 1917.
130 While at Versailles, Amery remained on Hankey's staff. Cf. his account of
direct responsibility to Lloyd George and Milner {Political Life, vol. II,
pp. 126-9) with Hankey's assertion that 'I and my Secretariat (Storr and
Amery) took charge.' {Supreme Command, vol.11, p. 733.) Amery does
acknowledge that 'nobody, indeed, could have been more helpful than
Hankey.'
131 Quoted by Walter Nimocks, Milner^3 s Young Men: The 'Kindergarten^3 in
Edwardian Imperial Affairs (London, 1968), p. 11; Milner to George Perkin,

132 CAB 21/101, 'Note on the composition of the Secretariat of the War
Cabinet,' 13 December 1916. According to Hankey's diary entry for the
previous day, his first conversation with Tom Jones had been responsible:' I
caught on to a scheme of organisation of the the office into two groups -
machinery and ideas.'
133 Hankey, Supreme Command, vol.11, pp. 589-90; yet another interim or-
ganizational scheme, outlined by Hankey on 16 December 1916 (quoted by
Roskill, Hankey, vol. I, p. 345) also proved abortive.

Hankey's 'prodigious memory' as well as his 'gift for distilling circum-

occasions, the Foreign Office handled the circulation of these documents.

204 Edward L. Spears, Prelude to Victory (London, 1939), p. 137. As Cabinet
Secretary, Hankey's performance bears out the judgment; as adviser, he was
not free from some such 'foolishness.'

the biographer's judgment of its high degree of technical accuracy.
206 Hankey Diary, dated 5 March 1915; the first entry dates to the previous day.
207 I have found no written evidence to document Hankey's claim - which dates
to 1945 - of Asquith's knowledge; on the other hand, Asquith may have given
no thought to Hankey's activities, as his own correspondence forms a record
of sorts.
208 For Lloyd George's awareness of the utility of Hankey's Diary, see below,
p. 64.
209 Nor does his biographer remark upon this element of release, although he
recognizes that Hankey confided ' his innermost thoughts and feelings at the
time of any entry.' (Roskill, Hankey, vol. I, p. 24.)

credit with others on his staff. (Supreme Command, vol. I, pp. 118-23.)
216 Quoted by Roskill, Hankey, vol. I, p. 136; within the War Book, he found
complaint with the 'belated and unsatisfactory... jejune and inadequate'

ever forget the Treasury performance.

2 A. J. P. Taylor, Politics in Wartime and Other Essays (London, 1954), p. 34.
Among the innovations were the Prime Minister's infrequent appearances at
the House of Commons; the submission of War Cabinet Reports not to
Parliament but to the nation; and the failure of one commoner minister, Sir
Joseph Maclay, even to enter the House of Commons.
3 88 HC Debates, 19 December 1916, col. 1343. Christopher Addison, who
supported Lloyd George, remarked upon the 'wholesale freedom from
recrimination.' {Four and a Half Years, vol. I, p. 286.)

'press contacts,' unlike his own; for those contacts, see Turner, Lloyd
George's Secretariat, pp. 168-9.

12 Hankey Diary, 18 March 1917.
13 Ibid., 11 and 12 April 1917. Lloyd George's irregular ways were clear even in
his days at the Treasury, when his associate Hobhouse had commented:
' Lloyd George can never concentrate his attention on anything for more than
5 min. together, [but] he is wonderfully quick at picking up an argument as
he goes.' (Hobhouse Diaries, p. 82; 21 November 1909.)
14 Hankey Diary, 30 May 1917.
15 Ibid., 2 August 1917.
16 E.g. he suggested to the premier that' the best plan would be for you to allow
the War Cabinet to meet without you to consider these... [domestic]
questions which arise from day to day, in order that the Government
machine may not become too congested.' (Lloyd George Papers, F/23/2/20,
Hankey to Prime Minister, 1 April 1918.)
17 107 HC Debates, 19 June 1918, col. 394. In so speaking on behalf of HMG,
Law served to remind the Commons that one of its leading grievances was
the oft-extended absence of the Prime Minister from its deliberations.
18 30 HL Debates, 19 June 1918, col. 251. Critics had also attacked the
government's proliferating bureaucracy.
19 Ibid., cols. 265-82.

frequently cited as a major indictment of past practices, see above pp. 15,20.

23 Quoted by Hazlehurst, Politicians at War, vol. I, p. 188. In all fairness, the

Churchill saw no objection to the former proposal.

27 Anthony Verrier, review of The Supreme Command; Political Quarterly, 32:
291 (July-September 1961). Hankey himself recorded the ego-boosting
remark in his diary entry for 31 October 1918.
28 Lloyd George Papers, F/38/3/23, Milner to Lloyd George, 13 April 1918.
Although Hankey knew from Lloyd George that he was also considering
Milner for the post, there is no evidence that Hankey thought of him as a
rival. Amery thought Hankey handicapped by his lack of 'necessary
authority with the public and the Army, more particularly if it was a question
of shifting Haig and making other drastic reforms'; he and Henry Wilson
agreed that the latter would advise the premier to appoint Milner, should his
advice be sought. Both viewed Hankey 'indispensable where he is.' {Amery
Diaries, p. 216; 14 April 1918.)
29 Hankey Diary, 30 June 1917; Hankey noted that accepting the post would
constitute a 'fearful gamble' for him, since it would involve his exchanging a
suitable position 'with good future prospects' for a 'rather rocky Ministry in
the most criticized post with a rather doubtful staff.'
30 Quoted by Roskill, Hankey, vol. II, p. 183; Esher to Hankey, 7 September

1920. If Esher's description is accurate, George V's remarks were prophetic:
' [He] said that you were the most important and useful public servant of the
Crown and State, that you were the only possible link between this
Government and any possible successor Government, and the Guardian of
the traditions of Government.'
31 Riddell, War Diary, 1914-1918, p. 351.

For additional contemporary testimony, see Amery, Political Life, vol. II,
pp. 172-3, and Gollin, Proconsul, p. 407 n. 1.
33 Hankey Diary, 23 November 1918; such a bias against Lloyd George calls for
a corrective comment from Henry Wilson to the premier:' you more than any
other man living or dead, you almost alone, won this war. That is the bare
truth and the whole truth.' (Lloyd George Papers, F/47/8/30, Wilson to
Prime Minister, 6 August 1919).
34 Jones, Diary with Letters, p. 470, 5 September 1940.
35 HNKY 4/46, Hankey to W. W. Hadley, 18 December 1954. As George V
was prejudiced against Lloyd Geroge, so was Hankey towards Churchill; for
the context of that latter prejudice see below, pp. 251-2 and 270.

Chancellor should be a member of that body, but Lloyd George countered
that making an exception for that position would lead to claims by other
ministers for inclusion.

74 Adams contended that such a staff ' should be more than a mere recording
body, or a body which circulates information. It should itself be an
investigative and intelligence organ, and this is its primary function.' In the
very long run, Adams' ideas were in a sense sustained in the creation of the
Central Policy Review Staff by the Heath government in 1970, although it
was ' designed to act for the Cabinet as a whole, to produce analyses to help
Ministers make independent policy decisions and to keep a close watch on
Government strategy.' Nonetheless, its depiction as 'a Prime Minister's
Department' in all but name (James Fox, 'The brains behind the throne,'
Sunday Times, 25 May 1973) does not convince, both because of its location
within the Cabinet Office and because premiers have since 1974 utilized an
obviously 'political' body to serve their own needs (see below, Ch. 7, n. 215).

88 Jones, Whitehall Diary, vol.1, p. 76; 10 February 1919: the Cabinet
Secretariat used the Foreign Office printer. Contrary to Wilson's assertion
that the Cabinet Conclusions exist 'in typescript only' for the period
March—October 1922, the change in format dates to November 1919; the
circulation of these typewritten conclusions was restricted in these last

94 As noted above, the real change did not come in October 1919, although
Hankey's diary confirms the Cabinet's intention. Only with the change in

Hankey cited in CAB 27/213, 'Experience in the Cabinet Office: Mem-

Cabinet papers was consistent with his war-time belief that 'to allow national
secrets to pass beyond the control of the Government is seriously to impair
the value of these precautions [taken by his Office].' (CAB 63/22, 'The
```

Custody of War Cabinet Documents: Note by the Secretary,' 14 August
1917.)
99 Hankey stated his conviction that publication of Cabinet Minutes was not a
possibility: 'There is, of course, no question of these [Imperial War Cabinet]
minutes ever being published. The principle of the collective responsibility
of the Cabinet for Cabinet decisions has been held to rule against this.' (CAB
21/198, Hankey to Prime Minister Hughes of Australia, 23 December 1918.)
Whether at this time he felt the same way about Cabinet papers is nowhere
apparent.
100 'The [CID] Secretariat have always done their utmost to recover Papers
from Ministers on leaving Office. On the whole, their efforts have met with a
considerable degree of success.' (CAB 27/213, 'Experience in the Cabinet
Office'.) Until 1908, Ministers had retained copies of CID papers, while the
military members had passed their files to their successors. (d'Ombrain, War
Machinery, p. 138.)
101 CAB 63/22, 'Custody of War Cabinet Documents.'
102 CAB 27/213, 'Experience,' from WC 217 (17 August 1917). The Secretary
pointed to the problem which would arise if Cabinet papers passed into the
hands of the executors of deceased former ministers; in any case, if the
documents were taken out of the country, they were beyond the
government's control.
103 CAB 27/213, 'Experience.'

109 Since Lloyd George had retained his War Cabinet records, the use of a
researcher - an Army officer who had served with the CID before and during
the war - likely indicated his interest in the papers of the three Cabinet
committees which had influenced war policy under Asquith; also Hankey's
indices were useful.

148 Hankey thought Curzon's character deficient in the heroic element: 'I can't
form a very high opinion of Curzon... "No man is a hero to his valet!" I
have been "intellectual valet" to many; Asquith, Balfour, Lloyd George
remain heroes; Curzon does not.' (Thomas Jones, Whitehall Diary, ed. Keith
Middlemas, vol. II, 1926—1930 (London, 1969), p. 100; Hankey to Jones, 10
May 1927.)
149 In the event of his resignation, Curzon perceived' a great national peril' in the
succession. (Quoted by the Earl of Ronaldshay, The Life of Lord Curzon,
vol. Ill (London, 1928), p. 256.)

Conference that it can be no matter for surprise that Mr. Lloyd George was
not in a position to let go entirely.' (CAB 63/39, 'Lord Curzon,' 19 May

162 On the last point, Jones noted (Whitehall Diary, vol. I, p. 197; 28 March
1922); 'The P.M. went off to Criccieth for three weeks... and the King first
heard of his departure in the newspapers and sent a hot message to

'inexcusable departure' for his country seat, Curzon did not read the
communique until forty-eight hours had elapsed. (Curzon, p. 271.) Lloyd
George's attack upon the Foreign Office's inability to conduct work prior to
11:30 am is reminiscent of Disraeli's 1878 description of it as 'a sleepy place.'

Lloyd George, p. 91) places the major responsibility upon the vacillating
leadership of Austen Chamberlain.
187 Apparently this phrase was first used by Winston Churchill in criticizing
Amery's organizing this particular Unionist group (Amery, Political Life,
vol. II, pp. 235—45). Morgan (Age of Lloyd George, p. 92) misquotes the
proper phrase.
188 Quoted by Blake, Unrepentant Tory, pp. 439-40. Of course the premier's
advisers attempted to relate 'the truth' to him in some substantive matters,
e.g. on the advisability of issuing the Balfour note in the summer of 1922, in
this case in vain. (Roberta Dayer, 'The British War Debts to the United
States and the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, 1920-1923,' Pacific Historical
Review, 45: 569-95 (no. 4, November 1976).)

11 CAB 21/221, 'The Cabinet Office: Note by the Secretary of the Cabinet,'^10

major part of which he published as chapter 3 of his Diplomacy by Conference,
in 1946; Part II, 'The Status of the Secretariat of the Cabinet and the
Committee of Imperial Defence,' 7 November 1922, dealt with the alleged
'wrong and extravagant' application of the principle; CAB 63/33.)

13 Sir Henry Craik, 'The Cabinet Secretariat,' The Nineteenth Century and
After, 91: 914 (June 1922), utilized a historical analogy: 'at a much earlier
period, the Secretaries, who were held to be of little account in the old days
when the Privy Council exercised large executive powers, gradually became
the great functionaries of State, instead of mere channels for promulgating
orders. May not the new Secretariat develop along the same lines?' (p. 920).
Of course the Secretariat did not come to replace the Cabinet, but the
Secretary became a major figure of state.

showing a sharp division and acrimonious feelings voiced in the Cabinet on
the previous day (C 61 (20), 17 November 1920). By comparing this to the
newspaper accounts, e.g. 'The Question at Issue,' The Times, 18 November,
it is clear that the Cabinet opponents of the trade agreement with Russia,
including Curzon and Churchill, stood to strengthen their opposition by
such a public ventilation.

an 'official hierarchy of unparalleled magnitude' for which he finds a
counterpart body in Lloyd George's time, although in fact renewed growth
in size and influence of that 'hierarchy' came after the Treasury re-
organization of 1919-20.
56 Mackintosh admits the movement away from the Cabinet as the only
decision-making body with which the premier shared power but qualifies
that judgment for the period to 1922: ' In these years the pattern was more
that of a cone with the Premier at the apex, depending on and supported by
widening rings of advisers. By far the most important of these rings was the
Cabinet, as it was the only one which had a definite publicly announced
membership, and the right to complain if it was not consulted.' {British
Cabinet, p. 388.)
57 In Chamberlain's words,' His Majesty's Government are unable to reconcile
the publication of the telegram of the Government of India on the sole
responsibility of the Cabinet' (151 HC Debates, 9 March 1922, col. 1490); he

exaggeration: ' [Hankey] was enkindled, sometimes perhaps dazzled, by the
sheer brilliance of intellect and imagination, which almost daily flashed and
scintillated before him like an Aurora Borealis.'

68 Hankey Diary, 21 October 1922.
69 Ibid.', Hankey had foreseen the eventual absorption of the League branch by
the Foreign Office (CAB 63/33, 'Experience in the Cabinet Office,' quoting
Hankey to Fisher, 5 March 1921), but he had done nothing to facilitate that
transfer.
70 Hankey Diary, 21 October 1922.
71 The exception was an Assistant Secretary, Sir John Chancellor, whom
Hankey judged' rather a misfit... who cannot get on with his subordinates';
even so the Cabinet Secretary sought to find a colonial governorship for him,
and Chancellor served in such a post in Southern Rhodesia from 1923 to
1928.
72 Hankey did not attach that account to his diary, but a copy was included in
his 'Magnum Opus' file, which eventually found its way into the Public
Record Office as CAB 63/1-191; Roskill wrote the first and second volume of
his biography in the absence of this file, although many of the documents
which Hankey retained in this file turn up in other Cabinet papers as well.
73 Apparently Hankey did not record the details of that first conversation, an
unusual lapse on his part which compounded the subsequent confusion.

74 CAB 63/33, 'Notes of Conversations with Mr. Bonar Law and Sir Warren
Fisher, on Wednesday, 25 October 1922,' a document which is the source for
the following description.
75 In other words, Fisher had not mentioned the scheme at their first meeting,
which - if Hankey's account is correct - gave him good reason for anger.
76 See above, pp. 71-2. It is ironic that 'semi-autonomous' status came as a sub-
department of the Treasury, but such a relationship applied only for
purposes of the parliamentary vote.

79 Fisher acknowledged that 'soldiers and sailors are constantly given in-
quiries,' and thus he understood Hankey's proposal.
80 Hankey Diary, 27 October 1922. Nearly a quarter-century Clerk of the Privy
Council, Fitzroy had only recently been charged, convicted and fined £5 for
' wilfully... annoying' women in Hyde Park. As Hankey foresaw, his appeal
succeeded - on a technicality. ('Sir A. Fitzroy's Appeal,' The Times, 11
November 1922.) Nonetheless, his behavior had been erratic, according to
police testimony, and the post came Hankey's way on 31 May 1923. (Roskill,
Hankey, vol. II, p. 314 n. 1.)
81 Hankey Diary, 27 October 1922.
82 A comparison of Hankey's own account with what he subsequently related to
Tom Jones is instructive, although the former is consistently fuller.
However, there is no mention in Jones' account {Whitehall Diary, vol.1,
pp. 218-19) of Hankey's accusations directed at Treasury performance;
instead we find a justification of the Secretariat's role in the Chanak
imbroglio, which Hankey does not mention in his own account.
83 If such a' cabal' existed, would Fisher have sought to add to his wide range of
responsibilities? Roskill {Hankey, vol. II, p. 313 n. 2) thinks it unlikely, and,
with the lack of any evidence, he certainly deserves the benefit of the doubt.
84 Jones Diary, dated 26 October, although the events described took place on

90 Roskill {Hankey, vol. II, p. 316) does not print this portion of the diary on the
grounds that 'his oft-used and vehement attack on the Treasury's failure to
prepare for war in 1914' is well known; while this is true, one senses that
another reason for the exclusion is that Hankey's bitterness about the
Treasury's indifference to the War Book verged on monomania, revealing an
intense quirk of character.

his fellow' mandarins' by his outspoken criticism of those who failed to meet
his high standards for the Civil Service; see above, p. 71.
104 Along such lines Mackintosh assesses the role of the Secretariat in a fashion
reminiscent of Hankey: 'While this office is not simply at the service of the
Prime Minister, the Chief Secretary to the Cabinet has often acted as
personal adviser and the effect of the Secretariat is to warn the Prime
Mininster of the issues and problems that are coming up from the
departments.' (Government and Politics of Britain, p. 64.)

of 1 November 1922, where it is found, largely intact, as Annex III of C 64

who maintains that' old-fashioned Cabinet government was re-established
in the 1920's in a form not very different from that described in The English
Constitution.' Crossman exaggerates the admittedly different styles of
government as between Lloyd George and his immediate successors; the
work of the Cabinet Secretariat incorporated substantial continuity.
119 159 HC Debates, col. 281. Neither Bonar Law's nor Baldwin's statement

but both served to confer institutional legitimacy.

122 Balfour Papers, Balfour to Hankey, 1 December 1928; Hankey had produced
records which effectively routed an American interpretation of the deliber-
ations concerning cruiser policy at the Washington Naval Conference.
123 Along these lines, Roskill (Hankey, vol. II, p. 258) describes Hankey's role at
Washington as 'surely considerable, since it was he who got the initially
gritty machinery of the conference to run smoothly, who was friendly and
tactful to everyone, and who often saw the best road to compromise.'
124 159 HC Debates, 7 December 1922, col. 1983.
125 As well, he had drawn a distinction between his recording' only the decisions
of the Cabinet' and maintaining a record of 'Cabinet proceedings'; Bonar
Law sought to put a quietus to the notion that the Cabinet Secretary was in
fact 'the repository of the opinions of each member of preceding Cabinets.'

129 Oddly, Hankey did not note what Burgis recollected, namely that at this time
the Cabinet Secretary was no longer permitted to take an assistant along to
help him to take the Cabinet Minutes. Possibly Hankey did not regard this as
anything new, since it had been proscribed in Lloyd George's peace-time
regime, although the regulation had not been enforced. See above, pp. 65-6.
130 Hankey Diary, 26 November 1922.
131 The phrase is Daalder's (Cabinet Reform, p. 60). Wilson (Cabinet Office,
pp. 86-7) lists twenty-two such conferences for which the Cabinet Office
'either alone or in association with other departments, provided the
secretariat for the United Kingdom delegation, and for which the Office
maintained a full record of the proceedings.'
132 HNKY 4/29, G. M. Trevelyan to Hankey, 21 May 1937; Trevelyan was
revising his History of England, and Hankey, characteristically, prevailed
upon him to limit the description of the secretarial innovation to a single
footnote, while treating the CID at paragraph length! (G. M. Trevelyan,
History of England, vol. Ill (London, pb. edn, 1953), pp. 261-2.)

4. THE SECRETARIAT IN THE I92OS: POLICIES AND PROCEDURES
1 Hankey Diary, 12 December 1922.
2 Gounaris had cited the correspondence in his own defence at the ' show trial'
which preceded his execution. (Walder, Chanak, p. 246.) Although A. J. P.
Taylor (Beaverbrook (New York, 1972), pp. 195-6) does not indicate how
Beaverbrook had come into possession of this particular letter, he does show
that half-a-dozen members of the Coalition Cabinet, including Lloyd
George, shared his belief that the document had never been circulated.
3 52 HC Debates, 7 December 1922, cols. 343-4.
4 PREM 1/18, Hankey to Prime Minister, 8 December 1922, found Hankey
misdating the Gounaris letter to 1921, a rare slip on his part. Although
Curzon protested his innocence of any such wrong-doing in a telegram on the
following day, Hankey had already resolved the matter in Curzon's favor;
thus Montgomery ('Lloyd George and the Greek Question,' pp. 256-8) errs
in asserting that the Foreign Office refuted Birkenhead's allegations.
5 52 HC Debates, 11 December 1922, cols. 355-6, responding to Salisbury's
recital (col. 352) of those facts, based upon Hankey's records.
6 The situation eased in 1924, when Ramsay MacDonald abandoned the
practice whereby the Prime Minister's Private Secretary and others within
the Private Office resigned with a change in the party complexion of the
government. While the Civil Service took over the Private Office, the
Political Office is staffed by partisan appointees. (Wilson, Governance of
Britain, pp. 79—80 and 91.)
7 Churchill had earlier assumed that such official documents as his Admiralty
telegrams would be published only in the Official Histories. (Martin S.
Gilbert, Winston S. Churchill, vol. IV, The Stricken World, 1916-1922
(Boston, 1975), pp. 751-9, an account of the gestation of Churchill's war
memoirs.) For the Official Histories, see below, pp. 120-3.
8 For that decision, which Hankey continued to question until he secured
repeal in 1934, see above, pp. 67-8.
9 Lloyd George Papers, G/4/4/4, draft letter to the Editor of The Times, which
Churchill at this time (28 February 1923)' deferred' from sending. Churchill
concluded that the doctrine of Cabinet secrecy was less than absolute: ' It
must be and always has been construed in conjunction with the time, the
character and the purpose of the reference.'
10 160 HC Debates, 15 February 1923, col. 315. The King had a figurehead role,
as is apparent in Hankey's comment to Churchill three years later,
concerning the third volume of his World Crisis: ' I do not know if it has
occurred to you, as a Privy Counsellor, to ask the leave of the King. I am not
sure that it is necessary, and in any event the King could only refer the matter
back to the Prime Minister. I have a feeling at the back of my mind that the
King will take it rather well if you ask him.' (CAB 63/38, Hankey to
Churchill, 10 December 1926.)
11 160 HC Debates, 19 February 1923, col. 593.
12 Churchill commented that Bonar Law's handling of the matter was 'very
unfriendly,' and his remark about the breach of the Privy Counsellor's Oath
' crude and uncalled for.' (Lloyd George Papers, G/4/4/4, Churchill to Lloyd
George, 28 February 1923.)

23 Hankey's action stands in marked contrast to d'Ombrain's reference to his
inaction in face of a cut of roughly half in the Historical Section's budget early in
1914, at Asquith's behest: 'To this Hankey raised not the slightest objec-
tion. "To live is to outlive'' had become his bonmot.' (War Machinery, p. 217.)

26 Thus Hankey stipulated the virtue of producing' one account which is based
on a review of all the facts and gives the authentic considerations by which
those officially responsible were actuated.' (CAB 63/40, untitled mem-

appeared.

32 At that Conference opinions were evenly divided concerning Corbett's
volume - 'a casting vote clinched it [publication]' - but sentiments
overwhelmingly favored the publication of Walter Raleigh's 'War in the
Air.' (CAB 103/83, Daniel to Raleigh, 13 December 1919.)
33 Ibid., Hankey Minute on Corbett to Daniel, 14 December 1919. Corbett had
entered the strongest protest: 'Publication was an essential condition of my
contract and I must beg that it will be understood that I cannot accept the
repudiation of the Government's commitments as in any way modifying my
position.'

54 Franks Committee Report, p. 123, judged * obviously erroneous' the conclu-
sion implicit in the 1920 remarks of the Attorney-General, Sir Gordon
Hewart, that the whole of the 1911 Act, including section 2, was concerned
only with spying. Certainly the 1919 court case did not concern espionage.
Hewart's remarks served only to cloud the issue, as the Franks Committee
recognized.

75 See above, p. 52. Roskill (Hankey, vol. II, p. 352 n. 1) acknowledges 'the
enormous amount of material' which Hankey had prepared for political
speeches.
76 This particular grievance - Jones' salary was half Hankey's - is spelled out in
Whitehall Diary, vol.11, p. 267; 24 January 1924; the discord apparently
vanished when Hankey secured his deputy a £300 increment. (Jones Diary,

79 Roskill, Hankey, vol. II, p. 154, quoting Hankey to Lloyd George, 17 March

80 Roskill, ibid., pp. 337-40, and Montgomery-Hyde, British Air Policy,
pp. 119-20 and 134-50, provide a concise introduction to the work of the
Salisbury Sub-Committee, sometimes known as the Salisbury Main Com-
mittee to differentiate its level from that of the Balfour Sub-Committee on
the Fleet Air Arm.
81 Quoted, Montgomery-Hyde, British Air Policy, p. 144.

83 HNKY 4/46, Hankey to Trenchard, 5 February 1954, quoting Cmd 1938

84 Trenchard admitted to Hankey that he coveted ' an official ring where I can
face Wilson and Beatty as an equal. If they intend to destroy me, they'd have
to do so under Queensberry rules,' according to Andrew Boyle's sympathetic
if imaginative biography, Trenchard (London, 1962), p. 348.
85 Hankey traced the embryonic form of the COS Committee to the Chanak
crisis, at which time the three met together to concert their advice, without a
Secretary; the tentative arrangement persisted after the crisis eased. (HNKY
4/46, Hankey to Trenchard, 5 February 1954, based upon Hankey's' Magnum
Opus' file, now CAB 63.) Trenchard deferred to Hankey's account: 'We [the
RAF] owed a lot to you in those days, and we also owed a lot to the Salisbury
Committee, for whose report you were responsible.' {Ibid., Trenchard to
Hankey, 8 February 1954.)

sent because Esher did not forward his proposal to the Editor of The Times,

sentence quoted here, but he could well have voiced the depth of his
sentiment when he met with Esher a few days later.

91 Relatively full minutes were more likely to provide retorts from ministers

World War: United Kingdom Military Series).
92 The COS Committee Minutes for 1923-January 1927 are in CAB 53/1.
Hankey traced a decline in the inter-service relations at the COS level to the
actions of the Air COS, Trenchard, who circulated to the Cabinet his
outspoken 'swan song' upon resigning that post in 1929; he gave his
counterparts only a day's notice. For the exchange between Hankey and
Trenchard, see Montgomery-Hyde, British Air Policy, pp. 245-7, and for
the renewed conflict between the two in 1935, see below, p. 243.
93 In claiming MacDonald's sanction for the resumption of his diary (see
Roskill, Hankey, vol. I, p. 24) the Clerk of the Privy Council paid little heed
to that Oath.
94 Hankey Diary, 11 October 1924.

99 Hankey Diary, n October 1924. In fairness to those 'Colonels and
Admirals' one should note that the very same evening the Club Committee
posted an invitation to MacDonald to become an honorary member, and
several members commended Hankey for his initiative.
100 Jones was no mere contributor: in Baldwin's wide-ranging speech at the
opening of the Imperial Conference in October 1923, Jones had written all
but one paragraph. (Whitehall Diary, vol. I, pp. 243-4.)
101 Ibid., pp. 255-7; Jones had asked for the photograph 'as a private souvenir
not for publication,' which was agreed to '"unless it makes a very nice
picture.'"
102 Cf. Hankey's action when the new Labour ministers left Buckingham Palace
after kissing hands: 'they wanted me to be photographed with them, but I
resisted this.' (Diary, 11 October 1924.) Yet his recent counterpart, Sir John
Hunt, feels differently, as he posed, 'a sentinel guarding the corridor linking
the Cabinet Office and Number 10 Downing Street,' for a dramatic
photograph accompanying Peter Hennessy's article, 'A magnificent piece of
powerful bureaucratic machinery,' The Times, 8 March 1976.

109 C 9 (24) 21,4 February 1924 (ibid.) Beatrice Webb's assertion (Webb Diaries,

this merely being red-tape, but I do not think that I agree... That there is
some risk of divulgence of secrecy in foreign hotels I know from personal
experience... Present company always excepted, Cabinet Ministers are too
busy to be really careful about papers, and in foreign hotels their staffs are
usually both small and over-worked.' (Ibid., Hankey to Cecil, 7 April 1927.)

123 Beatrice Webb (Webb Diaries, p. 4) advanced a similar explanation: 'The
peculiar characteristic of this Government is, in fact, that every member,
except perhaps Wheatley, has been a public servant and not a profiteer...
Whether its policy is right or wrong, Labour will prove itself emphatically fit
for administration.'
124 HNKY 4/16, copy of Hankey to Smuts, 1 April 1924.
125 Roskill, Hankey, vol.1, p. 24 asserts that MacDonald 'asked Hankey
whether he was still keeping a diary, and on receiving a qualified negative in
reply he instructed him to restart it for the benefit of himself and other
Ministers.'
126 Jones,' Introduction' to Diary with Letters, p. xiii; whether such a rationale
or his own desire for a private record was decisive, on at least one occasion
Jones made a rather full diary entry concerning a meeting of the Cabinet's
Coal Committee, despite the Prime Minister's instruction to circulate no
minutes. (Gilbert, Churchill, vol. V, p. 201 n. 1.)

129 Thus Roskill, Hankey, vol. II, p. 369 n. 1:' he had worked hard to achieve the
position of "principal adviser and counsellor" since the day MacDonald

Foreign Office's prerogatives at the conference.'
130 Webb Diaries, p. 44.
131 Quoted, 'By Whose Representation?' in The Times, 15 August 1924.
132 Only recently has the author of the letter been identified as Harry Pollitt,
then a member of the CPGB and later its Secretary. Of course the authorities
had no means of determining more than nominal responsibility. See N. D.
Siederer, 'The Campbell Case,' Journal of Contemporary History, 9: 143
(April 1974).
133 176 HC Debates, 30 July 1924, col. 2061 (G. S. Rentoul).
134 Sir Patrick Hastings, Autobiography (London, 1948), pp. 236-8; alone
among the Law Officers Hastings was a Member of the House of Commons,
and insufficient attention has been given his claim that 'nothing that I began
was I ever allowed to finish, and nothing was ever finished until something
else was begun.' Most difficult to accept is his claim that he put in a 'working
day' of twenty-two hours!
135 MacDonald objected to prosecution on the grounds that the CPGB was 'a
miserable lot of creatures, out for notoriety and mischief; quoted by Harold
Nicolson, King George V, pb. edn (London, 1952), pp. 514-15; MacDonald
to Stamfordham, 22 August 1924. Such an attitude to prosecution is
confirmed in his remarks to the Cabinet, quoted below, p. 142.

137 The authoritative account of F. H. Newark, 'The Campbell Case and the
First Labour Government,' Northern Ireland Legal Quarterly, 20: 19-42
(March 1969) asserts on the basis of Jones' notes that note-taking was not
among his abilities, but Middlemas (' Introduction,' Jones, Whitehall Diary,
vol. I, p. xiv) has pointed to the fact that Jones used a system of speed-writing
and a system of key words which, coupled to his powerful memory, made for
Conclusions in no way inferior to Hankey's.
138 The full text of Jones' notes is published in Whitehall Diary, vol.1,
pp. 287-90, although Roskill (Hankey, vol. II, p. 377 n. 5) complains that
Middlemas added several errors in printing these notes.
139 David Marquand, Ramsay MacDonald (London, 1977), p. 369, points to the
discrepancy, although he cautions: 'The discrepancy was not large, and it is
not particularly surprising that Jones did not spot it.'
140 It is in this regard that Hastings' explanation is questionable, because
incomplete. In his parliamentary remarks, Hastings asserted his desire to tell
the Commons 'every word that was said by everyone' at the Cabinet meeting
on 6 August, but he had been told ' I am not entitled to say what happened in
the Cabinet.' (177 HC Debates, 8 October 1924, col. 606). Nonetheless, if the
existence of such a letter had been alleged to him, surely he could have made
reference to it, independent of the Cabinet discussions.

what could be a telling exculpatory point in his behalf.
149 Note by Hankey, attached to C 48 (24), 6 August 1924 (CAB 23/48).
150 It is nowhere clear why Hankey took no action other than to record
MacDonald's challenge, although he may have concluded that the Prime
Minister wished only to make a statement for the record.
151 Marquand, MacDonald, p. 273, stresses the premier's 'rattling' in handling
the affair, although he views HMG's behavior as 'inept' rather than
unconstitutional. Even in its most favorable construction, MacDonald's
parliamentary answer is viewed as an 'appalling blunder,' although the
Prime Minister himself construed these events in a way more favorable to his
own conduct. (Quoted, p. 373.)
152 177 HC Debates, 30 September 1924, col. 16. His subsequent attempt to
explain away such an unqualified assertion, based upon a distinction between
his personal and official roles, is altogether unconvincing; the parliamentary
explanation is printed by Marquand, MacDonald, pp. 375-6.
153 Jones, Whitehall Diary, vol.1, p. 296; 15 October 1924, noting his own
reaction as well: 'When I heard it, as I did, in the House, a shiver ran down
my spine.'
154 Ibid. Hankey's practice guarded against what he thought Gladstone's fear of
the risk of one Cabinet minister' Hansardising' another, through references to
individual views expressed in Cabinet. (CAB 21/297, 'Notes on Lord Cecil's
speech in the House of Lords on the 16th November, 1927,' undated.)
155 Note by Hankey, attached to C 48 (24). According to Jones, he 'pointed out
to Hankey how damaging a procedure this was - to correct a Minute on the 22
September which had been approved on the 7 August and to do so after a
public agitation had begun.' He also pressed Hankey 'that if such a statement
was to be put on our records the Prime Minister should indicate precisely in
what respect the Minute was inaccurate.' (Jones, Whitehall Diary, vol.1,
pp. 296-7; 15 October 1924.) In fact the Cabinet Secretary did not correct
anything; he added a statement.
156 Ibid., pp. 291-2, copy of Hankey to Prime Minister, 2 October 1924.
Although Richard Crossman {Myths of Cabinet Government, p. 35) used this
incident to document his belief that 'the Cabinet Secretary can browbeat a
Prime Minister,' in my reading Hankey was seeking to set the record
straight, a proper function of his position.
157 MacDonald made precisely the same point in his diary entry, following upon
his conversation with Hankey. (Quoted, Marquand, Macdonald, pp. 373-4.)
Marquand does not credit Hankey's veiled attempt to give the Prime
Minister grounds to plead 'nolo contendere,' although such an effort
balances against his apparent inaction when MacDonald first challenged the
accuracy of the Cabinet Minute.

by this time prepared to bring down the minority government, whatever the
occasion.
159 Scott Diaries, pp. 475-6; 4 March 1925.
160 In view of MacDonald's attitude, from the perspective of Whitehall Gardens
it was fortuitous that the rough notes existed; in their absence the premier
could have argued that the Conclusion had been incorrectly drawn up,
perhaps securing a memorandum from the Attorney-General accepting full
responsibility. The credibility of the Cabinet Secretariat would surely have
suffered.
161 Jones, Whitehall Diary, vol.1, p. 293; 6 October 1924. In discussing the
circulation of the minute, the Cabinet ignored the real issue - its substance.
In fact, very little summary of the discussion appeared in the minute. In view
of the faulty memories of the Cabinet's discussion of the Campbell
prosecution, the prospect of ministerial paraphrasing of Cabinet Conclu-
sions ought to have given someone cause for concern.
162 Scott Diaries, p. 476.
163 Roskill, Hankey, vol. II, p. 382, quoting Jones to Hankey, 8 October 1924; he
gives full marks to Jones' arguing against a dissolution, since the likely return

position.'

167 The narrative in this paragraph draws upon L. Chester, S. Fay and H.
Young, The Zinoviev Letter (London, 1967). For other analyses of what
transpired see Christopher Andrew,' The British Secret Service and Anglo-
Soviet Relations in the 1920s,' Part I, Historical Journal, 20: 673-706 (no. 3,
1977) along with E. H. Carr 'Communications: The Zinoviev Letter,' ibid.,
22:209-10 (no. 1,1979) and C. Andrew, 'More on the Zinoviev Letter,' ibid.,
22: 211-14 (no. 1,1979), and also Gabriel Gorodetsky, The Precarious Truce:
Anglo-Soviet Relations, 1924-27 (Cambridge, 1977), pp. 35-52. The delay
may well be explained by a fact about which there is no dispute, namely that
other, similar' Zinoviev letters' had come to the Foreign Office's attention in
1924; the latest incorporated nothing new or unusual.
168 Quoted by Sommer, Haldane, p. 409.
169 Although Crowe's role is sympathetically examined in Andrew,' The British
Secret Service,' pp. 699-703, A. J.P. Taylor's explanation impresses:
'Crowe always thought that he knew better than his political superiors.'
{English History, 1914-1945 (Oxford, 1965), p. 226.)
170 Quoted, Marquand, MacDonald, pp. 384-5.
171 Jones, Whitehall Diary, vol.1, pp. 299-300; 31 October 1924. Cf. the
Foreign Office's own version, quoted by Andrew, 'British Secret Service,'
p. 703. Yet at the very least MacDonald ought to have been informed of the
course of events.
172 His political support from Labour party headquarters was 'hopelessly
inadequate' throughout the campaign (Marquand, MacDonald, p. 379), but
the Foreign Office's official support was no better.
173 Though rationalization likely entered, the Labour Cabinet, in J. H. Thomas'
words, 'agreed that up to Friday night all was going well with the Party
prospects; but with the publication on Saturday morning of the Zinoviev

letter there was a slump, "the people lost confidence in us; the women felt
frightened; speakers were paralyzed."' (Jones, Whitehall Diary, vol.1,
P-^2 99; 3^1 October 1924.) Although Macdonald's own explanation, offered
on the 27th, did not succeed in clarifying the matter, Marquand (Mac-
Donald, pp. 285-6) rightly observes that it is difficult to see what else he could
have said, sorely beset as he was on all sides.

176 C 17 (27) 4, 17 March 1927 (CAB 23/90B); while he informed the Cabinet
that the source of information had in the past proved trustworthy, Andrew's
recent account points to several such sources, all confirming authenticity.
Hankey, who knew the intelligence community well, accepted the ' Zinoviev
letter' as genuine throughout his life. (Andrew, 'More on the Zinoviev
Letter,' Historical Journal, 22: 213.)
177 Andrew, 'British Secret Service,' p. 705; he contends that the 'genuineness'
of the document is, in light of extant evidence, a more compelling hypothesis
than its forgery. Cf. Chester, Fay and Young, Zinoviev Letter, passim;
Gorodetsky, Precarious Truce, pp. 41-6; and E. H. Carr (who was a Foreign
Office official in 1924), 'Zinoviev Letter.'
178 The amount of the payment from Conservative funds has been variously
given as between £5000 and £10,000, but in any case constitutes an
enormous sum, especially if compared to the probable annual estimate for
the whole of the Secret Service in March 1921, £65,000! (Andrew, 'British
Secret Service,' p. 706.)

defiance of the rule which the Civil Service is normally supposed to enforce
on incoming administrations about the activities of their predecessors' that
the late Labour government had accepted the idea of an enlarged Korean
war, directed against China, in certain eventualities. Churchill proceeded to
chide the Labour Opposition for moving a vote of censure against his
administration because of a similar design. {Aneurin Bevan, vol. II,
1945-1960 (New York, 1973), p. 361.) At the time, Bevan drew attention to

of the CCR. The Cabinet Secretary's limited hopes for the Committee is
clear in CAB 63/37, Hankey to Balfour, 22 May 1925.

Imperial Conference of 1926 a reference to the CCR as an example of the
machinery for continuous contact between the dominions and Great Britain
(Roskill, Hankey, vol. II, pp. 427-8).

2 Between 1924 and 1929, the Cabinet averaged fully a score fewer yearly
meetings than in the peace-time Lloyd George coalition (Wilson, Cabinet
Office, Annex 7 (a)). The 1924-9 average of nearly fifty-six meetings

practice, which would have altered the nature of the committee.

13 Roskill's speculation is more extreme: had it not been for Hankey, 'a stage
might have been reached, as was the case with the German armed services,
where inter-service co-operation was totally frustrated - with fatal results.'

22 Cf. Roskill (Hankey, vol. II, pp. 393—6), who writes that Hankey did not
share 'Curzon's outright opposition to a Security Pact... and greatly
preferred that alternative ... to the Protocol.' As Hankey's diary for 22
March conveys little enthusiasm for any security pact, his position was closer
to Curzon's than to Austen Chamberlain's, although he did come round to
support the idea of a guarantee pact. For a Foreign Office appreciation of the
sole reason in favor of such a pact, CAB 4/12, CID 540-B, 'A Review of the

1928, and Hankey to Jones, 11 October 1928.
48 Ibid., p. 157, diary of 14 November 1928. The expression may have been
voiced to Jones by Sir Arthur Salter - in context the point is uncertain - but
Jones certainly agreed with the sentiment.

irony, Jones accompanied MacDonald as a speech-writer, the Campbell case

57 For that confidence, Stamfordham to Hankey, 15 January 1928,
quoted by Roskill, Hankey, vol. II, p. 455.
58 Middlemas and Barnes (Baldwin, p. 496) recognize that Hankey, in defence
matters, 'was prepared to go further than now would be thought proper in a
civil servant,' but otherwise played 'an impeccably constitutional hand.'
Despite this major exception, they nonetheless characterize Tom Jones'
relations with premiers 'unique in the history of the Civil Service.' Given
Hankey's activities, one cannot validate that claim.
59 C 23 (29) 3, 21 June 1929 (CAB 23/61).
60 C 28 (29) 1, 10 July 1929 (CAB 23/61).
61 These procedural decisions are found in C 22 (29), 10 June 1929 (CAB
23/61), although the heading for this meeting still bore the term
'Conclusions.'
62 In Hankey's absence at The Hague Conference in August 1929, Jones kept
the minutes for meetings of ministers, since MacDonald spent several weeks
away from London and a full Cabinet could not be convened.
63 Roskill, Hankey, vol. II, p. 477, who does not specify the departure from the
1929 mandate by Jones or, in August 1931, by Howorth.
64 For the collapse of the doctrine proper, see below, pp. 195-6.
65 Collected in CAB 23/90B.
66 Most at point is Crossman's allegation that the Cabinet Secretariat, during
Harold Wilson's first administration of 1964-6, regularly suppressed entire
sections of Cabinet Minutes on the grounds that they were too secret to
circulate. The result:' By eliminating whole sections from the discussion and
reporting others in full the Secretariat can greatly affect the way a decision is
interpreted in Whitehall.' (Richard Crossman, The Diaries of a Cabinet
Minister, vol.1, 1964-66 (London 1975), p. 590; 28 July 1966. Hereafter
cited as Crossman, Cabinet Diaries.) For a discussion of Crossman's charge,
see below, pp. 310-11.
67 Ibid., p. 90; 7 December 1964. A feature common to the two systems is shown
in Trend's claim that the Secretariat did not give verbatim what ministers
said but instead 'precis the sense and give the substance of what they say.' In
this specific instance, however, Crossman rejected such an explanation.
68 The claim must be somewhat qualified: Hankey's own diary yields evidence
of 'a small alteration proposed to the Cabinet Minutes' (4 March 1933).
Wilson, Cabinet Office, p. 10, prints in facsimile a more important instance of
Austen Chamberlain's amendment of Hankey's draft of a Cabinet Minute,
dating to 1922. And apparently MacDonald's questioning of Tom Jones'
minute bearing on the Campbell case in 1924 altogether slipped Burgis'
mind. Churchill had once challenged the accuracy of Hankey's record of'the
opinions expressed,' though in this case a Conference of Ministers was the
setting. (Gilbert, Churchill, vol. IV, p. 503; 2 December 1920.)

MacDonald's assertion to this article and thus cannot fathom 'the evasive-
ness, not to say untruth, of MacDonald's answer.'

headed by MacDonald.

88 Though the recall of the deputy to the Cabinet Office in the Secretary's
absence was understandable (Hankey explained to Jones that the Cabinet
had insisted 'on my going to this Reparations Conference - a most
unpleasant [task]'; Hankey to Jones, 1 August 1929, in Whitehall Diary,
vol. II, pp. 196-7) Hankey no doubt was aware of the rapport between Jones
and the Prime Minister.
89 HNKY 3/36 and 8/27, Hankey to Robin Hankey, 7 August and 5 September

reveal much about the workings of the Conference and substitute quite well
for the lack of any diary materials.

Lloyd George used the telephone technique at the Paris Peace Conference,
but he first devised the practice in writing to his wife Margaret from the Law
Courts in London, in order to protect his privacy. (John Grigg, The Young

98 Jones, Whitehall Diary, vol. II, pp. 228-30; Jones to Bickersteth, 23 De-

Prime Minister initially sat with five permanent officials, with the balance
'outsiders.'
99 Quoted by Skidelsky, Politicians, p. 158. The description applies to its first
months; subsequently, it came more to the fore, as the government turned to
it for a reappraisal of unemployment policy.

105 CAB 4/18, CID 955-B, 'Committee of Imperial Defence: Policy Regarding
Naval Construction Programme and Singapore. Statement by Prime
Minister,' 25 July 1929. In citing only a portion of these remarks, Roskill
(Hankey, vol. II, p. 496) protests that 'he gave no clue as to how or why this
was so,' but the balance of his comments addresses relevant international
conditions.
106 However, the COS Annual Review for 1930 maintained that the London
Treaty introduced no new factors 'tending to diminish the strategic
importance of the Singapore base.' (Quoted in Stephen Roskill, Naval Policy

117 Roskill (Hankey, vol. II, p. 520) does not specify the greater responsibilities
borne by others: the First Lord of the Admiralty, A. V. Alexander, judged
British interests well served by the pact's facilitating a much needed cruiser
construction program. (Information from Prof. D.C. Watt.) Whether
Hankey was so influenced is nowhere apparent.

dating to 1922, of accepting a record of dissent, described above, p. 94.
138 No capsule of the 'doctor's mandate' improves on Hankey's own, offered to
the Prime Minister during a Cabinet meeting:' Conservatives to be free to say
"We believe tariffs are essential, but we will keep an open mind." Liberals to
be free to say "We believe Free Trade will stand, but we will keep an open
mind." [National] Labour according as they are Tariff Reformers or Free
Traders.' Although MacDonald pencilled out this illustration, Hankey
remarked in his diary on 7 October 1931 that his outline proved to be
'substantially the ultimate settlement.'
139 Foot, Bevan, vol.11, p. 308 records this instance of Bevan's 'doubt and
dissent.' Harold Wilson's 1964 ruling (see above, Ch. 3 n. 42) appears to
qualify this outright refusal to record the existence of dissent with the Cabinet.
140 He confided in his diary on 3 October: 'there are occasions when it is wise to
be slow in circulating, just as there are times when one cannot be too quick.
In a crisis like this Minutes are a delicate business.'
141 C 7 (32) 1-3, 22 January 1932 (CAB 23/70).
142 The parliamentary exchange had been initiated by MacDonald's assertion:
'a Cabinet works as a whole and not in sections. [An hon. Member: "Does
this one?"] I hope so. When it ceases to do so, we will cease to exist.' (256 HC
Debates, 11 September 1931, col. 433.)
143 261 HC Debates, 8 February 1932, cols. 518-19. By an odd twist of fate,
Lansbury was dislodged from his position as Leader in 1935 following an
attack by Ernest Bevin cast precisely along these lines. (Naylor, Labour's
International Policy, p. 107.)
144 In 1975, the Labour government stuck an 'agreement to differ' concerning
Britain's continued membership in the European Economic Community;
although Harold Wilson concluded that the 1932 'precedent' was not an
exact one - there were substantive and procedural differences - he considered
it a sound one. (Governance of Britain, pp. 55 and 196-7.)

uncharacteristically strong language, 'and I shall be having a hell of a time.'
146 CAB 21/350, Hankey to Prime Minister, 28 August 1931. By dating this
letter a week later, Roskill (Hankey, vol. II, p. 550) does not recognize the
speed with which he put this independently conceived project into operation,
since Hankey had already canvassed a half-dozen leading civil servants.

quarters] of our position.' (CAB 63/44, 'Draft Programme of the National

153 Ibid., p. 17; 22 May 1933. Pownall, a Military Assistant Secretary at this
time, subsequently commented that Hankey ' likes to handle the big things
himself, de-centralisation ... is outside him' (p. 19; 12 June 1933). At the
same time, Pownall judged him 'a strange character, and not lovable.'

practice was revised to suit the Prime Minister's convenience; his vision was
worsening.

'Treasury control,' but in vain. (Peden, 'Fisher and Rearmament,' p. 35.)

171 273 HC Debates, 14 December 1932, cols. 405-10. Clearly Lloyd George's
intention was to embarrass Baldwin as well as Home, because the former, as
Chancellor during Bonar Law's administration, had run against the grain of
the Balfour Note in completing Home's mission in Washington. In routing
Home and entangling Baldwin, Lloyd George was master of the situation.

191 PREM 1/171, Howorth to H. G. Vincent, 26 October 1934. Such a linkage
apparently countered the complaint voiced as long ago as 1922 by the King's
Private Secretary that disclosure of Cabinet proceedings without prior
sanction from the Sovereign infringed the Privy Counsellor's Oath. (See C 68
(22) 9, 29 November 1922, in CAB 23/32.)
192 PREM 1/171, Howorth to Sir Clive Wigram, 2 November 1934; both

Secret Cabinet material is published.' (CAB 21/444, Howorth to Secretary,
31 December 1934.)
193 Sylvester Diary, p. 93; 4 April 1933. Hankey offered the suggestion both
because he thought George V deserved such recognition and he reasoned
that the King might be less critical of Lloyd George's hostile treatment of the
military figures.

197 CAB 21/444, Keynes to Hankey, 19 October 1933. The extracts were printed
in Lloyd George's War Memoirs, vol. II, pp. 134-6, coupled with a bitter
attack on the civil servant, concluding 'now not even his friends - least of all
his friends - have any longer the slightest faith in his judgments on finance.'

found in David Lloyd George, Memoirs of the Peace Conference, vol II (New
Haven, 1939), pp.294,^2965 301, and 335-8, although these strictures are
relatively mild in comparison to his attack on Keynes in 1933.

June 1956); also see the commentary, 'Shady Secrets?' by Robert Blake,
ibid., pp. 817-18.
2 Quoted by Williams, Public Interest, p. 70. In such a spirit, even the marginal
notes to section 1, written by the draftsmen in 1911, were dismissed as 'mere
catch-words' in a 1962 House of Lords judicial opinion, when section 1 was
extended to provide against acts of sabotage. (Ibid., p. 107.)
3 Ibid., p. 113.
4 Compton Mackenzie, My Life and Times: Octave j, 1931—1938 (London,
1968), pp. 306,60. Ultimately, the volume in question, Greek Memories, was
published in 1939, in an edition which Mackenzie claimed had not been
censored.
5 Ibid., pp.84, 102. Mackenzie added: 'Four or five years later Winston
Churchill told me that when my trial came on he did burn a lot of papers he
afterwards regretted burning.' One wonders if any such damage is evident in
the Churchill Papers at Chartwell.
6 The lack of any materials in Cabinet Secretariat files bearing on the
Mackenzie case reinforces his belief that the initiative lay with the Secret
Service.
7 Compton Mackenzie, Greek Memories (London, 1939), p. xiii. His anger was
fueled by a fine of £100 and a like sum in court costs; his legal fees were
£2500.
8 CAB 21/444, Hankey to H. G. Vincent, 15 September 1933, and Hankey to
Lloyd George, 17 October 1933. It appears that Lansdowne was given
permission to publish at least one memorandum but that he was denied
permission for several other requests.
9 CAB 21/391, from the Manchester Guardian, 6 March 1934. This copy of the
article is marked with references to the paragraphs in the documents which
Edgar Lansbury had drawn directly from.
10 Ibid., Howorth to Secretary, 6 March 1934: the two documents were the
specially secret CP 145 (30), 'Unemployment Policy (1930) Committee:
Memorandum by the First Commissioner of Works,' 6 May 1930, and UP
(30) 61, 'Panel of Ministers on Unemployment: Unemployment Insurance,
Memorandum by the First Commissioner of Works,' 6 February 1931;
Lansbury was the author of both. Ibid., Daily Telegraph, 21 March 1934,
contains Edgar Lansbury's assertion:' I did not know it was an offence at the
time,' but the presiding magistrate rejected the defendant's explanation.
11 Ibid., Howorth to Secretary, 'Biography of Mr. George Lansbury,' 5 March
1934; while Howorth mentioned 'the consent of the Sovereign' as a further
requirement for publication, he admitted that there had been no such case
since the war. Only subsequently was the Monarch's involvement specified
by HMG. (See above, pp. 117 and 207.)

39 For the first two, see above, Ch. 3 n. 36 and p. 176; in August 1934, under
different circumstances, Hankey had given the Evening Standard an
interview concerning his imperial tour. (Roskill, Hankey, vol. Ill,
1931-1963 (London, 1974), p. 118.)
40 CAB 21/457, 'Secrets and Safe Keeping,' quoting from an 'informant' at
Whitehall Gardens. Churchill had not yet replied, to be sure.
41 Possibly Howorth preferred the quiet purchase of such papers to legal
confiscation, but he did not specify any such instances; nor have I found
reference to such commercial transactions in any other source.
42 CAB 21/457, 'Ex Ministers and Secrets,' Daily Telegraph, 6 October 1934.
Howorth apparently concluded that the Times' article, 'Cabinet Docu-
ments,' of that date, was not worth retaining in his files.
43 Ibid., 'Ex Ministers Demand an Explanation from the Premier,' News
Chronicle, 6 October 1934, and 'Ex Ministers and Secrets.'
44 Quoted, ibid., '100 Demands Sent Out from No. 10,' Daily Express, 6
October 1934.
45 Taylor, English History, p. 603, advances the claim without source attri-
bution, but the source is likely Postgate, Lansbury, pp. vii-ix. Such
correspondence does not survive in the Lansbury Papers at the London
School of Economics; further doubt is thrown by Lloyd George's lack of
sympathy for the Lansburys in their recent travail (e.g. HNKY 4/26, Lloyd
George to Hankey, 19 April 1934).
46 For that pairing, Lloyd George Papers, G/4/5, Miss Pearman to Miss
Stevenson, 21 September 1934, and vice versa, 24 September.

see Winston S. Churchill: Companion to vol. V, Part 2, pp. 1195-7, 1198-9
and 1203-4. Of most interest was Hankey's response to Churchill's
obfuscatory query at what point a draft written by a Minister became a
Cabinet paper: 'once a draft has been initialled for an official purpose it
becomes an official document,' whatever its ultimate disposition.

51 CAB 24/257, CP 218 (35), 'Cabinet Procedure... Recovery of Cabinet

collection is puzzling since Lord Ronaldshay, in his Life of Curzon, which
had not been submitted to the Cabinet Office, published materials which
compromised the secrecy of post-war Cabinet discussions, particularly at the
time of the Chanak crisis. For this point about the biography I am indebted

73 PREM 4/7/6, Churchill to Edward Bridges, 30 April 1945. Of course,
Churchill had published documents which he had 'written and signed' in his
memoirs of the First World War; no doubt he would have cited the
precedent, had he been pressed by the Cabinet Office.
74 Ibid., J.R.C. [olville] to Bridges, 23 May 1945.
75 Ibid., 'Return of Cabinet Documents,' 22 May 1945; the Note, WP (45) 320,
'War Cabinet Documents,' 23 May 1945, was published over Churchill's
initials.
76 The bar upon publication without authority had been reiterated in 1942 by
the Deputy Prime Minister, Attlee. (Quoted, Radcliffe Committee Report,
p. 4; the Privy Counsellors ignored Churchill's role in dictating the rules for
the war period.) Bridges' memorandum, circulated to the Labour Cabinet on
10 May 1946, is published in full, ibid., pp. 5-8.
77 426 HC Debates, 1 August 1946, cols. 1207-8. The dispensation for pre-war
' defence themes' Bridges had insisted upon because ' the opening date can

80 Ibid., G/8/18/16,11 December 1930; Roskill {Hankey, vol. II, p. 532) missed
evidence of a telephone call in concluding that' rather oddly no reply from
Lloyd George has survived.' Hankey's altered feelings are spelled out in
Lloyd George Papers, G/8/18/22, Hankey to Sylvester, 26 January 1935.
81 CAB 21/445, Hankey to Sir Eric Geddes, 17 April 1936.
82 CAB 21/446, Memorandum, Howorth to Secretary, 7 July 1936. Thomas'
troubled financial condition - the former trade unionist and Labour leader
accepted funds from Tory coffers {Davidson's Memoirs, p. 410) - may have
been general knowledge in Whitehall and raised fears that his memoirs would
be replete with profitable revelations; the point remains speculative.
83 The Labour Opposition had pressed for a prosecution under the Official
Secrets Act, because a judicial inquiry had found that Thomas had made
certain unauthorized disclosures, which had led to rumored speculation on
the Stock Exchange: Attlee had pointed to the disparity between the
Lansbury case and Thomas' offence, which he claimed was far more serious.

85 MacDonald thought Thomas' mind 'not quite normal' owing to his recent
reversal of fortune. (CAB 21/446, MacDonald to Hankey, undated but likely
23 July 1936.)
86 C 35 (34) 4, 17 October 1934 (CAB 23/80) is the precedent Hankey cited.

87 C 54 (36) io, 22 July 1936, and C 55 (36) 1, 29 July (CAB 23/85). Although
Wilson (Cabinet Office, pp. 54-5) notes that the procedure followed in the
Thomas case became standard, he does not specify Hankey's transformation
of the 1934 ruling into this form.
88 For MacDonald's humanitarian suggestion, CAB 21/446, MacDonald to
Hankey, undated but likely 23 July 1936; Hankey's letter to Thomas df 24
July (ibid.) stated his belief that any exception to the rules would cause the
whole position to 'go west.'

Thomas to Hankey, 16 November 1936 (CAB 21/446).
94 CAB 21/444, Howorth to Petrie, 17 February 1936, and Howorth to
Secretary, 24 February; Howorth acknowledged that Long's draft mem-
orandum had been 'inadvertently preserved,' which makes the summons to
Petrie verge on the outrageous.
95 PREM 4/6/14, Notes of J.R.C. [olville], 17 January 1945, reporting to the
Prime Minister the views of Sir Edward Bridges, Sir Alex Cadogan, and Sir
Gilbert Laithwaite; Bridges to Keith Feiling (ibid.), 13 March 1945; to be
sure, the Milner case defined 'vindication' in a technical fashion which
Chamberlain's misfortunes did not meet. Feiling was given access to certain
departmental records, but no doubt these preceded Chamberlain's tenure as
premier.

110 The files CAB 21/457 and CAB 21/790, dealing with the recovery of Cabinet
documents, are continued in a file referred to in the Cabinet Office system as
Tart 3,' but that particular file had not been transferred to the Public Record
Office with them, surely because some of its contents considerably post-date
I945-
in Richard Ullman, Anglo-Soviet Relations, 1917-1921, vol. I, Intervention and
the War (Princeton, 1961).
112 It is unlikely that the Milner heirs resisted the request, but some Cabinet
papers obviously were not returned to Whitehall Gardens.
113 Information from Prof. D.C. Watt; for the 1958 legislation, see below,
pp. 289-93.
114 Wilson (Cabinet Office, p. 81) conveys official anxiety even forty years after
the fact: 'The visit appears to have given rise to a good deal of mis-
understanding both at home and overseas as to why, when on what was
ostensibly a private visit, he was engaged in official conversations, which if
they were to be entered in at all should be at ministerial level.' Cf. Roskill,
Hankey, vol. Ill, ch. 3.
115 Roskill, Hankey, vol. Ill, p. 142; Roskill's assertion that Howorth's per-
formance left something to be desired is based upon fragmentary inform-
ation; certainly his success in regaining custody of Cabinet papers Hankey
weighed heavily in his favor.

1932-1939 (Edinburgh, 1979) and 'Fisher and Rearmament'; Robert Paul
Shay, Jr, British Rearmament in the Thirties: Politics and Profits (Princeton,
1977). The first two authors are major sources for the account below.
117 Inskip, a lawyer-politician with no experience in defence matters, was
selected because he would improve the government's debating strength in
the House of Commons; Hankey's candidate had been Halifax, who of course
was a peer. (Peden, 'Fisher and Rearmament,' p.41.)

121 The DRC proposals had been examined in some detail by the Ministerial
Committee on Disarmament (DC(M)) prior to the Cabinet's action.
122 For an informative account of the discussions between February and June
1934, Peden, 'Fisher and Rearmament,' pp. 35-7; Ann Trotter, Britain and
East Asia, 1933-1937 (Cambridge, 1975), makes the point that Chamberlain
failed to get his way concerning Naval expenditure at the time (pp. 88-92),
but Gibbs {Rearmament, p. 125) depicts Chamberlain as quite pleased with
his efforts.
123 The phrase is Norman Rose's, in his Vansittart: Study of a Diplomat (New
York, 1978), p. 134.
124 E.g. Henry Pownall, quoted, ibid., p. 132; Vansittart and Fisher (Watt,
Personalities and Policies, p. 115) were both outspoken on the point.

Vansittart insisted on a corollary, namely that the most strenuous efforts
were required to reach an agreement with Japan.

134 Yet not even this scheme ought to obscure the fact that the diversity of
threats to Britain and her Empire meant that defence planning for the next
several years centered on what has been called ' a war of limited liability.'

135 Specifically, in the form of the 'Peace Ballot' of 1935; see Naylor, Labour's
International Policy, pp. 61-7, for the general misunderstanding.
136 '"An act of bad faith,"' Hankey commented. (Quoted by Rose, Vansittart,
p. 142.) Hankey had long since abandoned the idea of a convention, which he
had backed in 1932.
137 Pownall Diaries, vol.1, p. 36; 15 February 1934. Hankey's comment that
Fisher was 'rather mad' likely reflects in part Hankey's frustration with the
Treasury's scaling down of the first DRC report: yet Hankey specified a
'nerve disorder,' and Fisher had only returned to Whitehall in September
1933, following upon a long illness.

143 N. H. Gibbs argues persuasively that to assume all would have been well
without 'Treasury control' is 'to diagnose a complicated disease by
considering only one of its many symptoms.' {Rearmament, pp. 316—19). Cf.

strong case against the actions of the National Government.

151 CAB 63/51, CP 30 (36), 'Defence Co-ordination,' 7 February 1936. In the

George split in December 1916/
152 Pownall Diaries, vol. I, p. 102; 17 February 1936. Hankey's latest objections
to such a scheme are contained in his 'Notes for the Lord President of the
Council, in connection with his speech in the Parliamentary Debates on May
22, 1935,' 17 May 1935 (CAB 63/50).

156 Gibbs, Rearmament, p. 772; see his discussion of the defence machinery of
government in ch. 20.
157 For this reason, A. J.P. Taylor's incisive description of the new post -
'Inskip had one room, two secretaries and no powers' {English History,
P- 39°) ~ is misleading, although Inskip in fact had no power of decision.
158 Diary, n March 1936, quoted by Iain Macleod, Neville Chamberlain (New
York, 1962), p. 173.
159 The words are attributed to Ismay by the official historians, Sir Charles
Webster and Noble Frankland, The Strategic Air Offensive Against Ger-
many, 1939—1945, vol. I, Preparation (London, 1961), pp. 76—7. {History of

Cabinet also recognized that fighters were cheaper and easier to build.

committees were too numerous and too deliberative.
175 Gibbs, Rearmament, pp. 767-71 for a summary of the CID machinery.
176 A verdict shared by the official historian of rearmament, ibid., p. 809; cf. the
views of Lawrence R. Pratt, East of Malta, West of Suez: Britain's
Mediterranean Policy, 1936-1939 (Cambridge, 1975), PP- IO4-5> tnat
Chamberlain's 'real failing lay in his willingness to be guided by mediocre
advice... the fallible opinion of very fallible men.' It is difficult to see this
relationship other than in terms of near-identity of strategic thought,
however.
177 CAB 63/52, 'Role of the British Army: Note by the Secretary,' 18 January
1937: 'without haste but without rest.'
178 Both views are quoted by Michael Howard, The Continental Commitment
(London, 1972), pp. 118-19. 1939 had emerged from the deliberations of the
DRC, whose second, interim, report looked to 1 January 1939 as the date
beyond which it would not be safe to postpone readiness for war, although,
on balance, the DRC concluded that German aggression ought not to
eventuate before 1942. (Gibbs, Rearmament, pp. 178-80.) Hankey sub-
scribed to the prospect of Britain's readiness by 1939. (Roskill, Hankey,
vol. Ill, pp. 236-8.)
179 That the Foreign Office encouraged the 'buying [of] time until British
rearmament had reached the stage of defensive impregnability in 1939' is
shown in W. N. Medlicott, Britain and Germany: The Search for Agreement,
1930-1937 (London, 1969), pp. 27-31. Vansittart, who supported the
project, dubbed those who held this view 'The Thirty-Niners,' although he
personally saw no certainty that Hitler would wait until that time.
180 Quoted by Pratt, East of Malta, p. 95.
181 Quoted, ibid., p. 96; Pratt's account establishes Hankey's centrality in the
formulation of Mediterranean strategy and diplomacy, not least because
Chamberlain had enlisted him to lobby for the policy of accommodation.
182 Ibid., pp. 94-100. Frustration within the Foreign Office felt with the policy
of accommodation is typified in Oliver Harvey's comment - 'The attitude of
the Service departments is most disturbing. Whenever ANY action is
proposed they produce nothing but difficulties.' (The Diplomatic Diaries of
Oliver Harvey, 1937-1940, ed. John Harvey (New York, 1970), p. 87; 8
February 1938 (hereafter cited as Harvey Diplomatic Diaries).)
183 Pratt, East of Malta, p. 94; Pratt minces no words about Hankey's' emotional
approval of Fascism,' and it must be remarked that his ' Italy, Some Notes of
a Holiday Visit,' 27 September 1937 (CAB 21/563) lend themselves to such a
characterization; cf. Roskill, Hankey, vol. Ill, pp. 269-70.
184 Quoted, Roskill, Hankey, vol. Ill, p. 306; Hankey to Vansittart, 18 February
1938.
185 Both points are made by Pratt, East of Malta, pp. 104-5, but they are quite
distinct: the one is acceptable, the other not.
186 In 1935 Hankey had prodded MacDonald to resign but had urged Baldwin
not to defer to Chamberlain; Balfour's opinion dated to 1929. (Hankey
Diary, 24 February 1935.)
187 CAB 23/52, 'Role of the British Army.'
188 Both a CID sub-committee and the Treasury remarked upon these
developments, and the latter linked the prospects for radar with Britain's
defence needs. (Peden, British Rearmament, pp. 129-30.)

'"Parity" in the sense of exact equality with Germany is unobtainable in

192 CAB 63/53, copy of Hankey to Sir Eric Phipps [Roskill's attribution], 21
February 1938. Hankey's peaceful repose contrasts distinctly to Winston
Churchill's turmoil and 'vision of Death.' (The Gathering Storm (Boston,
1948), pp. 257-8.)
193 Although the term 'appeaser' has developed a loose historical connotation
(see Naylor, Labour's International Policy, pp. 214-23), it is well to dif-
ferentiate Chamberlain's purpose (ibid., pp. 237-49) from those of others,
Hankey included.

200 Morton's actions have long been recognized, although challenged by
Montgomery-Hyde (British Air Policy, p. 462 n. 9). Gilbert's Churchill
leaves no doubt of Morton's involvement.
201 In January 1936 Hankey had asked the same of Churchill, receiving the
assurance that nothing save his own experienced judgment was involved.
(Gilbert, Churchill, vol. V, pp. 701-2.)
202 Montgomery-Hyde, British Air Policy, pp. 394-5; on the other hand,
Swinton took very seriously Milch's reference during the visit to a possible
doubling in size of the Luftwaffe. (Quoted, Gibbs, Rearmament, pp. 568-9.)
203 Quoted, Gilbert, Churchill, vol. V, r)p. 875-6; MacLean to Wing-Cmdr
Anderson.
204 Fuller quotations from the exchange between the two are found, ibid.,

Churchill's case with Roskill's reliance (Hankey, vol. Ill, pp. 263 and 664-5)
on reconstructed German sources.
206 See the colorful account, based upon a conversation with Hankey, of C. P.
Snow, who marveled: 'It would have been untypical for Hankey to say
unnecessary rude words in a conversation: to do it on paper (a civil servant's
major sin) seemed beyond belief.' (Variety of Men (New York, 1966), p. 158.)

a suitable position opened. (Hankey Diary, 6 April 1937.) Although Roskill
(Hankey, vol. Ill, p. 279) records Hankey's interest in the Suez Canal
Company in June 1937, he does not establish the Cabinet Secretary's direct
approach to Chamberlain some months later.
228 As long ago as 1927, Hankey had foreseen the possibility that the CID
Secretary might serve as a Deputy Secretary to the Cabinet. (Quoted,

memorandum of 9 May as the basis for his conversation with the Prime
Minister.

official had not yet lost Chamberlain's confidence, which followed upon

247 Roskill, Hankey, vol. Ill, p. 362. Burgis' direct observation is apt: 'What he
[Churchill] wanted to do was to jettison our organisation... and replace it
by some contraption of his own. Pug Ismay, to his everlasting credit, fought
this revolutionary idea tooth and nail. What is more, he won. Considering
that Ismay scarcely knew Churchill in those days, this was something of a feat
and a notable contribution to ultimate victory.' (Burgis Memoirs.)

7. THE CUSTODY OF CABINET SECRECY
1 Wilson, Cabinet Office, pp. 90, 115; ch. 9 describes the relationship between
the Cabinet Office and the War Cabinet. Cf. Hennessy, 'A magnificent

```
piece,' who maintains that the war 'transformed the Cabinet Office as it did
the entire structure of central government'; the operation was conducted,
however, along well-established lines, and the contribution of the inter-war
Cabinet Secretariat is under-valued, however 'rudimentary' the operation
may appear.
2 An early example is his involvement in a meeting with the Foreign Secretary,
the Chancellor, the Home Secretary, and the Permanent Under-Secretary to
the Foreign Office, at which the possibilities of a plebiscite as a means of
settling the Sudeten dispute were discussed; Vansittart was 'deliberately
excluded.' (The Diaries of Sir Alexander Cadogan, 1938-45, ed. David Dilks
(New York, 1972), p. 98; 15 September 1938.)
3 Lawrence Burgis, once again in the office, described the Cabinet Secretary as
'all at sea' with the new premier; Burgis Memoirs.
4 Stacey, Government of Modern Britain, p. 361. From 1968 until recently, the
post of Head of the Civil Service carried with it a Civil Service Department.
Following upon its abolition, since the spring of 1983 the Cabinet Secretary,
Sir Robert Armstrong, has also served as Head of the Civil Service, although
some of the former department's functions were assigned to the Treasury.
5 For descriptions of the role and influence, Stacey, British Government, 1966
to 1975, pp. 86-95; G. W. Jones, 'The Development of the Cabinet,' in
William Thornhill, ed., The Modernization of British Government (London,
I975)? PP- 50-3; Hennessy, 'A magnificent piece.' The best-known descrip-
tion (Anthony Sampson, The New Anatomy of Britain (London, 1971),
pp. 69—73 and 249-64) is also the most controversial.
6 With the merger, Howorth was appointed Deputy Secretary (Civil) and
Ismay Deputy Secretary (Military). For Ismay's resistance to Churchill's
scheme, see above Ch. 6 n. 247.
7 A recollection of Ronald Wells, quoted by Roskill, Hankey, vol. Ill, p. 366
n. 1; Churchill expressed strong misgivings about the extant committee
system in a minute of 24 May 1940; re-organization followed in June.
(Wilson, Cabinet Office, pp. 94-5.)
8 Burgis Memoirs. The judgment fails to take into account Hankey's deferring
to the wishes of successive premiers with regard to the fullness of minutes.
9 CAB 21/1341, WP (G) (39) 1, 'Institution of the War Cabinet: Note by the
Secretary,' 5 September 1939. In such a fashion the invidious distinctions
about which ministers should receive which minutes was avoided. Surely,
the King continued to receive the Cabinet Minutes, as he had from the first.
10 Wilson, Cabinet Office, p. 113; in 1976 the staff numbered 681, although
nearly half were employed in the Central Statistical Office. The re-
sponsibilities are sketched in CAB 21/778, Howorth's Office Note, 11
September 1939.
11 CAB 21/1084, 'Functions of the Cabinet Secretariat: Memorandum by the
Secretary of the War Cabinet,' 14 September 1944. Bridges' claim that this
document was the first-ever formal statement of Secretariat functions
impresses as disingenuous.
12 For the disagreements with Churchill and an evaluation of Hankey's
ministerial contributions, see Roskill, Hankey, vol. Ill, chs. 12-15. Perhaps
their ministerial relationship was flawed from the first, as Hankey judged that
his 'main job' in the Chamberlain War Cabinet was 'to keep an eye on
Winston!' (Quoted, Gilbert, Churchill, vol. V, p. 1108; Hankey to Adeline
Hankey, 3 September 1939.)

13 HNKY 25/1, Bridges to Hankey, 28 September 1943 and 3 March 1944;
Hankey had yet to approach a publisher.
14 Ibid., Bridges to Hankey, 30 November 1944, referred to this as 'the main
issue' which he had raised with Hankey at their March meeting.
15 Ibid., Hankey to Bridges, 27 October 1944.
16 Given this argument, it is altogether odd that Hankey's appeal did not
specify the distinction 'formalised in a decision taken by the Prime Minister
in June 1938 that information relating to the period from the beginning of the
war to the 1st November, 1919... should be treated on a different and more
lenient basis than information relating to the period after that date.'
(Memorandum of Sir Edward Bridges, May 1946, printed in Radcliffe
Committee Report, p. 6.) Hankey had of course been Cabinet Secretary at the
time.

24 In the judgment of Brian Bond, editor of the Pownall Diaries, vol. I, p. xx.
Each of the individual diaries was prefaced: 'Private and Confidential. This is
a private diary, to read only by myself or my wife. It can however be made
available to the eventual student of the War, if he wishes - provided that he
makes no quotations from it and, in making use of it, does not refer to its
existence.' Eventually he relented and held no objection to its publication
after his death.
25 Dilks, 'Introduction' to Cadogan Diaries, p. 17. Halifax's effort was the last
of the diplomatic 'blue books' published in this century, a development
indicative of the restricted flow of information given the public about the
conduct of British foreign policy. (Watt 'Foreign Affairs.' pp. 123-4.) Yet
something of the practice survived in the 1965 publication of a collection
dealing with post-war events in Southeast Asia, Documents relating to British
Involvement in the Indo-China conflict, 1945-1965, Cmnd 2834.
26 Dilks, 'Introduction' to Cadogan Diaries, p. 16.
27 E.g. Oliver Harvey in Harvey Diplomatic Diaries (pp. 50-1; 15 October 1937)
on the personnel of the Chamberlain Cabinet: 'The worst ones are Hoare and
Swinton: the first is consumed with ambition to be P.M., though God knows
he'd land his party on the rocks in six months, and has never forgiven
A.E.[den] for succeeding him. Swinton is anyway a very second-rate
politician. Simon is slippery and evasive, a moral coward; yet incredible as it
seems, he also believes that he can become P.M.' And so on, in a lesser key,
for most of the others, save Eden.

his official papers at the behest of the National Government in 1934, as had
Churchill, and yet another irony, Addison; the other Labour minister
involved was the Home Secretary, Chuter Ede, who alone had played no part
in those proceedings.

they funked giving a decision adverse to Winston.' (Ibid., Hankey to
Trenchard, 6 April 1949.)

43 Jones' own comments, which were the basis for 'Cabinet Diary Withheld,'

contain no exchange of correspondence either with Bridges or Brook.
44 Ibid., no. 16, 'Cabinet Diary Withheld.' The untitled article in the Evening
Standard nonetheless claimed that Jones decided not to proceed only after
'so many alterations and deletions were made when he submitted the
manuscript.' Perhaps he did not consider these a form of official pressure.
45 Roskill, Hankey, vol. Ill, p. 613. To a prospective publisher Hankey

1958. In view of Hankey's protestation, his claim that Macmillan's rejoinder
contained 'the first mention of a possible infringement of the Official Secrets
Act' (note on Macmillan's letter) is simplified if not misleading; it stands as

for Macmillan's views is Hankey's second-hand account, but the Prime
Minister's attitude is proved out by the government's inaction.
113 For one result of the decision to open papers relating to criminal investig-
ations after seventy-five years, see the account of a purulent Victorian

124 Anthony Eden (Earl of Avon), Full Circle (Boston, i960), p. vii.
125 As a rule, Hankey destroyed such notes upon receiving approval for the
formal minutes; the lapse is inexplicable. Roskill notes (Hankey, vol. Ill,
p. 299) that since the 1950s' the original documents have... been destroyed,
though the notes taken by Avon's research assistant have survived.'
126 Eden's research assistant for the volume dealing with events to his
resignation in 1938, published in 1962, was David Dilks.
127 618 HC Debates, 25 February i960, cols. 570-3. Whatever the reason,
Macmillan erred, because only the war period had been regarded as
'something different'; the exception had been granted precisely because
'during the war much information that would ordinarily have been
published had to be kept secret for reasons of military security.' (426 HC
Debates, 1 August 1946, cols. 1207-8.) Nonetheless, post-war governments
generally accepted the 'precedent.' (Radclijfe Committee Report, p. 17.)

129 Macmillan is quoted, as is one concerned academic, by Watt, 'Foreign
Affairs,' pp. 121-2.
130 D. C. Watt, 'Contemporary History in Britain: Problems and Perspectives,^5
Journal of the Society of Archivists (1969).
131 Something of the tone of exasperation felt in official circles with 'jackals
fighting for carcass-scraps' is present in the comments of Robert Rhodes-
James, 'The Fifty-Year Rule,' The Spectator, 213: 233-4 (21 August 1964),
whose proposals were soon outpaced by events; similarly, his fear that the
maintenance of Cabinet Minutes had compromised the integrity of Cabinet
discussions was belied by the availability of those minutes. Rhodes James
was at this time Senior Clerk of the House of Commons, and thus a public
servant.
132 Watt, 'Contemporary History.' The Balfour and Cecil papers were released
directly.
133 The Society claims responsibility for persuading HMG to reduce the period
of closure, but I am persuaded by D. C. Watt's evidence that the
Oxford-Cambridge-London group had already made substantial progress,
particularly at the Cabinet Office. Certainly the presence of leading
academics who had served in the Cabinet Office Historical Section on the
civil and military sides of the Second World War series was an important
asset in the group's endeavors.
134 Crossman, Cabinet Diaries, vol. I, pp. 303-4; 5 August 1966. Bolstering his
constant complaint that the Cabinet Minutes failed to reflect accurately the
actual course of the deliberations, Crossman noted: 'This formed the main
discussion but I wasn't surprised to find not a word of my arguments was
retained in the Cabinet minutes.'
135 According to Harold Wilson, who pointed out that his government had' gone
beyond the advice which we have received, which was for a period of 40
years.' (733 HC Debates, 10 August 1966, col. 1708.)
136 Harold Wilson, A Personal Record: The Labour Government, 1964-1970
(Boston, 1971)3 pp. 203-4.
137 Quoted in Thomas, 'Towards a Revision,' p. 124; 8 February 1967. Yet
when Heath came to power in 1970, his government took no steps to
implement the Franks Committee's proposal to reduce the scope of the
Official Secrets Act in the cause of such access.
138 The years 1945-50 were proposed; editorial problems have delayed publi-
cation. (Information from Prof. D. C. Watt.)
139 Quoted, Watt, 'Contemporary History.' Certainly precedent existed for
such a delay in publication, as the multi-volume version of Sir Llewellyn
Woodward's British Foreign Policy in the Second World War (5 vols., 1970-6)
(History of the Second World War: United Kingdom Military Series), written
for official use between 1942 and 1950, was long held back and has only
recently been published in its entirety.
140 At some point after 1966 policies concerning the Official Histories were
relaxed, thus enabling Norman Gibbs, for example, 'to assign to individuals
by name the view expressed by them in Cabinet and also to give specific
references to sources' in his account of the defence plans of the 1930s.
(Rearmament, 'Editor's Preface,' by J. R. M. B[utler], p. xix.) The change is
of course consistent with the availability of the records themselves.

146 Nutting, No End of a Lesson, pp. 13-14; the view is reinforced by the recent
assertion made by the-then public relations adviser to Eden, William Clark,
that 'the official documents of the time "if not destroyed totally" were
confined "in a way that will not make them available for a very long time."'
(Quoted, 'Briton Divulges Steps to '56 Decision to Seize Suez,' New York

Account (London, 1978), who claimed to have had access to Cabinet and
Foreign Office papers 'affecting his time in office.'
147 The comment is attributed to Nutting's 'Preface' on the dust jacket of the
book, but the comment cannot be found there; perhaps one may speculate
that Nutting rewrote the 'Preface' which is identical in the English and
American editions, eliminating the claim which his publishers nonetheless
featured.

against the practice: ' I strongly disapprove of people in active public life

175 Quoted, Widgery, 'Law Report^5 ; Sir John Hunt to Graham C. Greene of
Jonathan Cape, 22 June 1974. As contemporary practices are not a matter of
public record, the statement is particularly valuable.
176 Widgery, 'Law Report.' Crossman extended no protection to the 'confiden-
tial' relationship, to be sure, but George Brown's memoirs had certainly
breached this particular point; see above, n. 157.
177 Crossman, Cabinet Diaries, vol. I, p. 24; 22 October 1964. The Sunday Times
deleted all critical references to identified civil servants with the exception of
Dame Evelyn and the-then Cabinet Secretary, Sir Burke Trend. Prior to the
court decision, Anthony Howard ('Crossman: Bagehot or Creevy?' New
Statesman, 89: 330; 14 March 1975) claimed such deletions made for 'an
important imbalance' and contended that Crossman deserved 'the same
freedom of expression that Lady Falkenden [Marcia Williams] exercised in
her 1964-70 memoirs, Inside Number 10S
178 Quoted by Corina Adam, 'Rules for Gentlemen,' New Statesman, 90: 132 (1
August 1975). Trend's reference had been directed to 'what passed between
him and his colleagues on a particular occasion,' and thus it is unlikely that
Sir Burke intended such license for the ministerial-adviser relationship.
179 Adam,' Rules for Gentlemen,' p. 132. Hunt argued that Trend had made the
statement' "at the end of a very long day of oral evidence,"' as if to signal a
weakness in his predecessor's resolve.

183 Quoted, Widgery, 'Law Report.'
184 Howard, 'Crossman,' p. 329; not quite all, e.g. the masking of the identities
of all but the most senior civil servants.
185 Some suspect that the entire matter would have been handled differently had
Crossman lived; it has even been suggested that HMG would not have taken
any action to bar publication were he alive. (Private information.) His
executors seemingly viewed any passage by passage review, along the lines
agreed to by Hugh Dalton (see above, n. 154), as a breach of their obligation
to preserve the text of Crossman's diary as he had prepared it. (Information
from Prof. D. C. Watt.)

187 The Spectator was quite critical of the protection afforded the Civil Service:
'A more open system of government in the civil service would both help to
expose those who have consistently been wrong in terms of government
policy but consistently successful in terms of bureaucratic warfare, and
might even help to ventilate conflicting views within the bureaucracy which
are otherwise stifled.' ('A Judgement for More Open Government,' 235:459;

191 Crossman, Cabinet Diaries, vol.1, p. 11; Middlemas' comment ('Cabinet
Secrecy,' p. 50) is apt:' For the first time in the post-war years, we have had a
broad and yet intricate picture of modern Cabinet government, impressive as
much for its accumulation of detail as for its critique of the political process.'
192 Testified to by his associate in editing the diaries for publication: Janet
Morgan, 'The Making of the Crossman Diary,' New Statesman, 90: 702 (5
December 1975).
193 E.g. Crossman, Cabinet Diaries, vol. I. p. 132 (17 January 1965) and p. 433
(23 January 1966).
194 Howard,'Crossman,' p. 330, uses the term 'rival administration' in describ-
ing this as Crossman's most important discovery; Woodrow Wyatt makes
much the same point in his review, remarking that 'inter-departmental
committees of civil servants... with the blessing of the prime minister,
make many of the decisions that matter without most ministers understand-
ing what is going on.' For an earlier recognition, see above, p. 63.
195 Such secrecy is not new: with the exception of the Second World War years,
' it was not the usual practice to give information to Parliament or the public
about the existence, terms, or membership of Cabinet committees.' (Wilson,
Cabinet Office, p. 15.) Their present role is highly protected, even if in a
maladroit fashion criticized by Michael Davie in a three-part 'Notebook'
{The Observer, 7, 14, and 21 November 1976).
196 Crossman, Cabinet Diaries, vol. I, p. 491; 3 April 1966.
197 Crossman's assertion is quoted more fully, above, p. 179. Barbara Castle
recorded several similar assertions for the Wilson regime of 1974-6,
commenting that 'it is almost impossible to get them altered afterwards,
particularly if the PM has a vested interest in the official version.' (The Castle
Diaries, 1974-1976 (New York, 1980), pp. 251-2; 14 December 1974 and
p. 711; 31 March 1976.)
198 Wilson, Governance of Britain, p. 56. Yet Wilson supplied an example of
such inventiveness, dating to his service in the Cabinet Office in 1940.
Provided a set of inconclusive notes, he was told by Sir Edward Bridges to
summarize a Cabinet discussion which he had not himself heard: '"This is
your subject. You know what they ought to have decided, presumably. Write
the Minutes on those lines, and no one will ever question it."' (Ibid., p. 53.)
Nor could Wilson resist drafting a minute at the time of his stepping down in
1976, in his Cabinet Secretary's words, '"the first time he has undertaken
such a task (despite some stories to the contrary) since he served in the
Cabinet Secretariat during the war."' (Castle Diaries, 1974-1976, p. 693; 18
March 1976.)
199 Crossman, Myths of Cabinet Government (Cambridge, Mass., 1972),
PP- 33-4-
200 Mallaby, From My Level', Macmillan added that' historians reading this fifty
or a hundred years hence will get a totally false picture.'
201 Wilson, Governance of Britain, p. 56, adding tongue-in-cheek: 'The Cabinet
minutes are immaculately conceived.'
202 A. J.P. Taylor (review) proposed a 'historian's' answer which merits
consideration: 'Crossman never grasped that in the British system civil
servants are loyal to their department, to the Treasury which determines

###### loyal to the Minister except in a conventional way. For civil servants the

did not intend to sign any agreement subscribing to the terms of the Radcliffe
report:' I don't intend to sign anything which prevents me putting distorted
records straight.' Shades of Lloyd George!
213 The phrase is used in the Radcliffe Committee Report, p. 25, as a means of
discounting the relevance of criminal law in such cases. In the wake of the
publication of the Castle Diaries, there are signs of a burgeoning impatience
that such responsible individuals should have recourse to' instant books'; see
Michael Foot,' "To set diary against diary is to spread endless misapprehen-
sion,"' The Listener, 104: 386-8 (25 September 1980) and David Wood,
'Spare Us the Political Diaries,' The Times, 29 September 1980.
214 Quoted, 'Court Action on Memoirs.. .,' The Times, 27 January 1976.
215 The group was headed by Dr Bernard Donoughue of the London School of
Economics; its political coloration is confirmed by Donoughue's retirement
upon Margaret Thatcher's succession. Although civil servants are seconded
to this body, preserved by the Tory regime, it is wholly distinct from the
Central Policy Review Staff disbanded by the Thatcher government in mid-

1983. Barbara Castle has retrospectively claimed that in the years 1974-6 she
'never found that the CPRS or Dr Donoghue's [sic] unit had any noticeable
effect on the decisions we took.' {Castle Diaries, 1974-1976, p. 49 n. 1.) Yet
that diary demonstrates that Mrs Castle was not involved in the inner
workings of the Wilson regime.
216 Anthony Sampson (The Changing Anatomy of Britain (London, 1982), pp.
240-5) locates 'the heart of the secrecy world' in the Joint Intelligence
Committee, lodged in the Cabinet Office, where its head works alongside the
Cabinet Secretary, although directly responsible to the Prime Minister.

I. DOCUMENTARY COLLECTIONS AND RELATED WORKS
Documentary collections comprise the core of the historical materials upon which
this study has been based; were it not for the existence of such collections,
accumulated in official and private hands, any attempt to depict the interaction of
institutional and political factors contributing to the development of the Cabinet
Secretariat would be futile. It is the peculiar admixture of Cabinet records with
the private accounts and correspondence of the men who brought order from
chaos in the maintenance of Cabinet records that enables us to take the measure of
their contributions to the establishment of an institution and to the development
of modern Cabinet government.
My own debt to Cabinet records - the term is used in a comprehensive fashion -
is apparenc throughout my work; fortunate for those who have used these records
in Chancery Lane and now in Kew, several publications prepared by the staff of
the Public Record Office serve as a valuable guide to the invaluable collection.
The first, The Records of the Cabinet Office to 1922, written principally by A. W.
Mabbs, was published in 1966 to accompany the release of the first Cabinet
records, originating in the Lloyd George war-time coalition and extending
through the demise of its peace-time counterpart in 1922. Three categories of
Cabinet records particularly informed my account of these formative years,
namely CAB 23, Cabinet Minutes; CAB 24, Memoranda and other papers
circulated to the Cabinet (often referred to as Cabinet Papers); and CAB 21, a
collection of Registered Files dealing topically with a variegated range of issues
brought to the Cabinet or, in some cases, concerned with the work of the Cabinet
Secretariat. The contents of CAB 21 have been winnowed to remove materials
duplicated elsewhere, e.g. in CAB 24, but there remains much evidence otherwise
unavailable about the workings of the Cabinet Secretariat. Records of the Cabinet
Office to 1922 describes other categories of Cabinet records less frequently used
here but occasionally of considerable significance, e.g. records maintained prior
to 1916 for the Committee of Imperial Defence and during the early years of the
war for the War Council, the Dardanelles Committee and the War Committee.
To be sure, Cabinet papers exist for the years prior to 1916, although no system
guided their maintenance; as a result, the Public Record Office mounted an effort
to collect such documents for the years from 1880 to 1916, drawing upon private
as well as government collections. In 1964 and 1966, Lists of Cabinet Papers for

```

```
Bibliography 399
```
1880-1914 and 1915-16 were published by the PRO, with the contents of each
item specified; thus the papers of the three war committees alluded to above are
described, as now collected within CAB 42. In a similar fashion, CAB 41 contains
photographic copies of the Prime Minister's Letters to the Sovereign from 1867 to
1916; the List and Index Society published a descriptive list of the contents of
these items in 1965.
A second Public Record Office Handbook extended the description of the
Secretariat, known from 1921 as the Cabinet Office; published in 1975 under the
title of The Cabinet Office to 194s, S. S. Wilson's institutional treatment describes
both the activities of the operation and the one hundred and twenty-seven CAB
categories developed to the end of the Second World War; Wilson appends a
useful set of twelve annexes, including a valuable set of recollections of Cabinet
procedures prior to the Lloyd George reforms. Also noteworthy are several
chapters dealing with the Committee of Imperial Defence and with the Historical
Section of the Cabinet Office. The volume impresses as a model of the way in
which the Public Record Office discharges its obligation to inform the public
concerning the Cabinet records which it maintains and to guide scholars in their
utilization of the collection. For the Cabinet records to the time of Hankey's
departure in 1938, the triad of CAB 21, 23, and 24 continues to account for the
institutional dimension of the work of the Cabinet and its secretariat. One other
category deserves mention, namely CAB 63, a collection of Sir Maurice Hankey's
own devising, including copies of official papers which he had written or dealing
with topics in which he took a strong interest (thus duplicating a number of
documents found in other places). Designed to provide for Hankey's long-
planned 'Magnum Opus,' in several instances Hankey himself drew upon the
collection; yet his biographer, Captain Roskill, lacked access to the file while
engaged upon the first two volumes of his work. Discovered and thereafter
transferred to the Public Record Office, the collection was fittingly included
among the other Cabinet records which Hankey had provided and maintained.
Certain other categories of Cabinet records, e.g. CAB 101-3, which deal with the
work of the Historical Section, are cited in this study, but, given the thorough
review of all classes contained in The Cabinet Office to 1945, review of their
contents here would serve no real purpose.
Albeit not a class of Cabinet records, PREM 1 affords some limited insights
about the workings of the Prime Minister's own office in the years to 1939; with
the advent of war, and of Winston Churchill, the staff work done for him in his
capacity as Minister of Defence can be found in PREM 3 and PREM 4, known
popularly as 'the PM files' and 'the Churchill papers.' A number of government
publications over the years assume a documentary importance in the activities of
the Cabinet Office; indeed, several recent items shed light on aspects of the
custody of Cabinet secrecy which could not otherwise be discerned within the
dark shadows of the thirty-year rule. In particular, the Report of the Departmental
Committee on Section 2 of the Official Secrets Act 1911 (Cmnd 5104,1972), cited as
the Franks Committee Report', the Reform of Section 2 of the Official Secrets Act
1911 (Cmnd 7285,1978); and the Report of the Committee of Privy Counsellors on
Ministerial Memoirs (Cmnd 6386,1976) are essential in tracing through present-
day patterns stemming from the designs initiated or developed by the first
Secretary to the Cabinet. Linked to the last of these reports is the judicial opinion
of Lord Chief Justice Widgery, by way of comment upon the propriety of
ministerial memoirs; including discussion of matters which the contemporary
Cabinet Office would not otherwise comment upon, Widgery's finding, printed in

the' Law Report' column of The Times on 2 October 1975, cleared the way for the
publication of Richard Crossman's provocative Cabinet Diaries.
To revert to the early years of Hankey's own tenure of office, the two War
Cabinet Reports for 1917 and 1918 (respectively Cd 9005, 1918 and Cmd 325,
1919) are useful, although they must be used with caution, prepared as they were
by those who had an interest in sustaining the Lloyd George reforms; also useful,
and in this case written by the advocates of a future order, is the Report of the
Machinery of Government Committee (Cd 9230,1918). A publication of a different
sort, and indispensable, is the Parliamentary Debates, which occasionally raises
issues which inform this work, from the first days of the Cabinet Secretariat to the
recent discussions of the parameters of official secrecy in a free society: both the
House of Commons Debates and the House of Lords Debates proved significant in
limning the political context in which the Cabinet Office has operated.
Precisely because the office itself and the Cabinet Secretary in his own right are
adjuncts to modern Cabinet government, neither official sources nor the useful
institutional accounts contained in the PRO Handbooks suffice for a comprehen-
sive account of the development of the Secretariat. Nor do they attempt to raise the
question of the influence which the founding generation of the Cabinet
Secretariat exercised upon their political 'masters.' Yet the influence of such
highly placed civil servants as Maurice Hankey and Thomas Jones is a topic well
worth the attention of students of British government. For this reason, private
paper collections are vital if such an assessment is to be undertaken. Not
surprisingly, the most important of such collections is the Hankey Papers, housed
in the Churchill College Archives Centre of Cambridge University. In addition to
an extensive assemblage of Hankey's correspondence, spanning the years from his
service with the Committee of Imperial Defence to his lengthy struggle with
latter-day Cabinet Secretaries to secure official sanction for the publication of his
memoirs of the First World War, Hankey's diary, kept, albeit with lapses, until
August 1942, is of utmost importance, for reasons adduced above. For all the
excellence of Roskill's biography, Hankey: Man of Secrets (3 vols., London,
1970-4) - I have addressed the specifics of that excellence in the Historical
Journal, 13 (no. 4,1970); 16 (no. 3,1973); and 18 (no. 2, i975)-the student of 'the
man and the institution' must have recourse to the Hankey Papers. While Roskill
prints lengthy extracts from the diary in dealing with important episodes, in many
cases he limits himself to phrases or sentences; for that reason, references in this
work are to the diary proper, although much of this material perforce can be found
in the biography. In addition to the Cabinet Secretary's correspondence with
many of the leading political and military figures of his time, his letters to his
family, particularly to his wife while abroad, are replete with comments upon the
proceedings at international conferences and the like; in fact this correspondence
ultimately outpaces in detail and incisiveness the private record which Hankey
intended to attach to his diary upon returning to England. Hankey himself used
the diaries, albeit in a veiled fashion which was dictated by his successors at the
Cabinet Office, in preparing his memoirs of the war, The Supreme Command,
1914-1918 (2 vols., London, 1961), and of Versailles, The Supreme Control at the
Paris Peace Conference, 1919 (London, 1963). In addition to several published
lectures, Hankey drew upon his 'Magnum Opus' file in collecting a number of
essays under the title of Diplomacy by Conference (London, 1946). Whatever the
keenness of his observations expressed in these forums, his own participation in
nearly all of the events he described ought not be forgotten.
Yet another participant-observer of the Cabinet Secretariat from its first days

until well past the time of its acceptance as a permanent part of the scene was
Hankey's deputy, Thomas Jones, whose diary has seen light of print in a more
systematic way than has that of his chief. Edited by Keith Middlemas, Jones'
record, Whitehall Diary (3 vols., London, 1969-71) is most germane to this
inquiry in its first two volumes, dealing with the Cabinet Office from 1916 to his.
own retirement in 1930. Middlemas' selections incline towards lengthy and self-
contained extracts, usefully framed by connective and explanatory materials. The
result is a greater sense of the diary proper, although the process of selection
mandates examination of the diary itself (which Jones had privately printed), at
the National Library of Wales, Aberystwyth. Also included in the Thomas Jones
Papers is his correspondence with a wide range of public figures; Jones himself
published A Diary with Letters, 1931—1950 (London, 1954), which drew upon his
experiences after he left government service. Yet a third Secretariat functionary,
of lesser significance, was Lawrence Burgis, who late in his life prepared memoirs,
which are now available at the Churchill College Archives Centre, Cambridge.
Among other collections of private papers the most useful proved to be the
Lloyd George Papers, once a part of the much-lamented Beaverbrook Library
and now available in the House of Lords Record Office; sharing a similar fate and
facilities, but of much less import, are the Bonar Law Papers. In addition, I have
found the following collections useful, although I have utilized some only on a
very selective basis:
Asquith Papers, Bodleian Library, Oxford University
Baldwin Papers, University Library, Cambridge
Balfour Papers, British Museum (now Library)
Campbell-Bannerman Papers, British Museum
Austen Chamberlain Papers, University of Birmingham Library
Esher Archives, Churchill College Archives Centre
Haldane Papers, National Library of Scotland, Edinburgh
Lansbury Papers, London School of Economics Library

II. PRINTED SOURCES
Only printed sources cited in the text are listed here, primarily to serve as a guide
to those who wish to pursue further the matters raised in this book; towards that
end I have classified several types of printed sources. The first category is
organized by the author of the collection, rather than by the latter-day editor.
Several of the most important printed sources have been discussed above, in
conjunction with the major documentary collection upon which they are based. A
last point: English editions of works cited in an American edition exist in many

Newspapers and Journals
Some journal articles of lesser importance to this study are not listed above, but
each is fully referenced in the Notes. In a similar fashion, far more newspapers
have been drawn upon than are here cited, courtesy of the copious file of press
clippings kept by the Cabinet Secretariat, which subsequently found their way
into a CAB 21 file. The newspapers and journals cited below have been used
independently of that convenient source of press opinion. Among newspapers I
would specify The Daily Telegraphy The Observer, The Sunday Telegraph, The
Sunday Times and, indispensably, The Times', among journals The Economist,
Law Quarterly Review, The Listener, The Nation, The New Statesman, The
Nineteenth Century and After, The Spectator, and The Times Literary Supplement.
