  <summary>History</summary>
In June 1967, the Library opened in a small room in the Sutton Community Building. After a series of minor improvements, a major renovation improved the 
 facility in 1986. Following several years of fundraising, grant writing and community financial support, a new library building opened in 2009 on Main Street.</details>
<details>
  <summary>Services</summary>
  <p>Book Discussion Group: We offer a book discussion group for adults.  It meets the second Thursday of every month at 4 p.m.  We typically read and discuss books recommended by the WV Library Commission.</P>
  <p>Tax Forms: We offer State and Federal tax forms on-site during tax season.  If there you need forms that we do not have on hand, we are able to print them from the IRS website in most cases.</p>
  <p>FAX Service: For sending and receiving FAXes we do charge $1.00 per page.</p>
 <p>Photo Copier/Laser Printing: We charge $.25 per photocopied or printed page.</p>
 <p>Inter Library Loans: We participate in an Interlibrary Loan service in order to obtain materials not available in our collection.  This service depends on the generosity of public and academic libraries across the state.  For security reasons interlibrary loan materials must be signed out from the front desk. In order to receive this privilege the borrower agrees to:  1.  Accept responsibility for materials between signing out and signing in. This includes cost of damage to or loss of borrowed item. 2. Return the materials by the date due marked on the interlibrary loan slip. Not returning materials to the lending library on time may jeopardize our ability to continue receiving interlibrary loan services from that library. Please make every effort to return this material by the due date.  Please note: Borrowers may be required to have a valid library card with the MLN system in order to check out Interlibrary Loan materials.</p>
 <p>Computer/Internet Access: We offer six computers for public use, including internet access.  We do have a 45 minute time limit for computer usage. The library also offers free wireless internet access.</p>
 <p>Videos: We offer both popular release movies as well as children's movies in DVD and BluRay format.</p>
 <p>Paperback Book Exchange: You can exchange paperback books from our exchange rack on a 1 for 1 trade.</p>
 <p>Ongoing Used Book Sale: We have an ongoing book sale section in our library, offering used paperback books at $1.50 per bag and hardback books 2 for $1.</p>
 <p>Books on-Tape: We offer a wide selection of books on tape, with a lesser though ever-growing collection of books on CD.</p>
