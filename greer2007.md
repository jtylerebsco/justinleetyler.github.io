### FOREWORD

```
When, in the early ’70s, I was a codirector of the Findhorn
Foundation Community, an international spiritual center in
the north of Scotland, I had the pleasure of knowing and
working with Robert Ogilvy Crombie (or ROC, as he was
known by his friends).He was a lively, gentle, and loving eld-
erly Scot who was a Hermetic magician. Though he lived in
Edinburgh, he was a frequent visitor to the community and
an integral part of its spiritual life. Findhorn is best known
around the world for its contact with the inner kingdoms of
nature—the spiritual intelligences behind all growing things.
Part of this contact was made by Dorothy Maclean, one of
the three founders of the community, whose specialty was
communication with the “devas” or angels of various plant
species. It was ROC, though, who had contact and communi-
cation with the elemental forces of nature, the Nature Spirits.
This contact was his most public contribution, but behind
the scenes, he had a special role as the community’s guardian.
It was in this regard that I came to know and respect his mag-
ical skills and knowledge.
For his ceremonial work, ROC said he used the tradition
originating with the fabled Order of the Golden Dawn, the
famous magical lodge established in England in the late 1880s
that became the renewing, driving force behind so much of
```

```
```
the occultism and magic of the twentieth century. However,
his training was something of a mystery. A heart ailment at an
early age had kept him from holding a steady job. Told by doc-
tors to seek out isolation and quiet, he lived for many years in
a cottage in an ancient forest, rather Merlin-like. It was there
that he made the deep contact with the forces of nature and,
I believe, based on things he told me, it was there under their
tutelage that he learned the basic principles of magic, prin-
ciples he later augmented by extensive study in the fields of
psychology, physics, and the Hermetic writings of Western
magic.
Whatever the nature of his training, ROC clothed his
magic in a context of attunement to nature. Although he
lived in the center of a major city, nature was supremely
important to him. Indeed, although he never claimed such a
thing,I often felt in his presence that I was with a Druid.
In 1973, I returned from Findhorn and Scotland to pick
up my work in the United States.Before I left, I had a final
conversation with ROC in which he said he felt he was one
of the last practitioners of an older tradition of magic. “A
new formof magic is unfolding,”he said,“I can see it,but it’s
not for me to do. It’s for you and those of your generation
and the next.”
These words echoed something I had been told several
years earlier. From childhood on, I have had an ongoing con-
tact with nonphysical beings. One summer, right after my
graduation from high school but before I entered college, I
had had a short, unexpected visit from a being who said sim-
ply,“In the future,a new form of spirituality will unfold.
With it will come a new kind of magic.” At the time, I had
just stored this away under the “Interesting-but-I-don’t-know-
what-to-do-about-it”mental file. But ROC’s words reawak-

```
ened my alertness to new possibilities in the field of magic
and spirituality.
However, although I had an interest in magic and prac-
ticed a very personal form of it that I wove out of my own
inner experiences, my work and life took me in other direc-
tions. It was not for another twenty years that magic began
to occupy my attention again in a serious way. By then I had
begun to meet and work with modern magicians who were
trained in the old methods but were transforming them
through their own insights and experiences. People such as
John and Caitlin Matthews, William Bloom, R. J. Stewart,
and others seemed to me to be pushing at the envelope of
the magical traditions and opening exciting possibilities for
new directions in the magical arts. And I began my own
experiments in that direction as well, exploring what I call
an “incarnational magic.”
Then I came across a book that sent me on an expedition
to find everything that its author had written. The book was
Inside a Magical Lodge, one of the finest and clearest books on
the magical tradition and its structure that I had found. The
author was John Michael Greer,the writer of the excellent
book you are now holding. Soon, thanks to the wonders of
the Internet and the services of Amazon.com (and what Re-
naissancemage ever had such a willing and able invisible ser-
vant to bring him knowledge?), I had everything John Michael
had written and was working my way through it with a ris-
ing excitement.
For what I discovered when I read Inside a Magical Lodge
and, subsequently, his other books was three things: a bril-
liant scholarly mind that was deeply knowledgeable of the
history and traditions of the magical arts, the practical wis-
dom of an experienced practitioner of those arts, and, most

```
important from my point of view, the inner feel of someone
on the track of formulating a new kind of magic for the
twenty-first century.
I decided I wanted to get to know this man. But I had no
idea where he was.
This is where magic stepped in. I had been invited to
speak at a summer conference in Oregon near the Columbia
River Gorge, a spectacularly beautiful area. The event was
held in a rural camp under the trees. Early on the morning I
was to give a workshop, I stood in the main clearing looking
at a large board with the day’s schedule on it and saw that the
other speaker of the day was John Michael Greer! Hooray!
Here would be my chance to meet him. But closer inspec-
tion sawthat we were teaching at the same time in different
areas of the camp. I would not be able to go hear him talk
after all.
I heard a sigh behind me and saw a tall, bearded, hand-
some fellow standing a few feet away also contemplating the
schedule board.
“Conflicts?” I asked.
“Yes,”he said.
“Me, too. I really wanted to hear John Michael Greer,
but I’m teaching a workshop at the same time.”
“Are you David Spangler?” he asked.
“Yes.”
“Well, I’m John Michael Greer, and I wanted to hear you!”
If there was no magic behind this meeting, then I will eat
my hat. But even magic only goes so far. We still didn’t get
to hear each other that day.A friend of mine did go listen to
John Michael, whose talk introduced some of the themes in
this book, and he consoled me by telling me—several times
and at length—just howexcellent John Michael had been!

```
Since then I have had the pleasure of making up for my
loss that day, both in personal communications and visits
with John Michael and in enjoying his prolificacy with books.
One of his latest, AWorld Full of Gods, I am already using as a
textbook in some of my classes on contemporary spirituality,
and I have no doubt that I will be using this one as well.
What most attracts me to John Michael’s work is that I
see him as one of those who are bringing a new understand-
ing and practice of magic into being. When because of my
own inner contact and later because of ROC’s words, I
began to consider that new ways of working magic were
going to appear, my thoughts turned toward the forms of
magic.By “new magic,” I thought what was meant were new
forms of ritual or new ways of contacting spiritual sources of
energy and power. I had to grow in my own experience to
realize that this isn’t what was meant at all. It’s not that new
forms may not appear or have not appeared; people are
experimenting with magical forms and rituals all the time.
But the essence of a new magic—the kind of thing ROC was
talking about and I assume my inner contact was predicting—
lies in a newunderstanding of the nature of magic itself.Not
just an understanding of how to do it, but of what it is.
Magic, as John Michael eloquently points out in this
book,is not some glamorous, supernatural power apart from
life. It is the energies and processes of life itself. It is rooted in
our connectedness with the life of the world around us, and
its greatest effect is to root us and connect us even more
fully.In fact,one could say that magic is the expression of
our connectedness. A magician, we come to see, is not some-
one who stands apart and wields vast forces in some imper-
sonal manner from a lonely mountain top. Rather he or she
is a person who is immersed in the world, a participant, part
```

Foreword ix

Druid Magick 3rd pages.qxd 11/9/07 2:35 PM Page ix


```
of the life of nature, part of the life of humanity, at home in
forests and in cities, wherever life is.To “do magic” is to serve
life. It is to enhance the capacity of life, in whatever form, to
be fully what it is and to become perhaps more than it might
expect.
John Michael knows this point and is able to convey it in
clear and compelling prose. He is not only a fine and expe-
rienced magician. He is also a blessedly fine writer. I’m envi-
ous on both counts!
In this book, John Michael is presenting a specific form of
magic, namely Druid magic. The specificity is important. In
our world, life manifests through forms and bodies. It pos-
sesses particularity.The raccoons that occasionally sleep in the
trees in my backyard are not the same as the trees, and both
are different from me. Druid magic is not the Hermetic magic
of the Order of the Golden Dawn,nor is it Egyptian magic,
nor Native American magic. It’s important to understand and
honor the differences and not attempt to make one the other.
I would make a poor raccoon and an even poorer tree.
So John Michael gifts us with a powerful form based on
ancient traditions.If we are Druids,we can appreciate the
connectedness and depth this magical form offers us with
all that we love and honor in the Druid path. If we are not
Druids, we can still appreciate the spirit of connection and
depth of practice this book offers and the vision it offers of
holistic ways, connected ways, and collaborative ways of doing
magic.
Either way, it offers us a chance to fulfill the vision of a
newmagic,for behind the practices and techniques John
Michael offers is something I feel is more subtle and maybe
more important: the idea that it isn’t a new magic that is
evolving but new magicians. It is magicians who understand
```
```
x Foreword
```
Druid Magick 3rd pages.qxd 11/9/07 2:35 PM Page x


```
the honor of being human but at the same time the respon-
sibility and joy of being connected, of being part of a larger
wholeness of life and serving the energies that flow through
that wholeness. It is the vision of a magician who loves, in-
deed who is love.
The Druid path may well offer a greater opportunity to
come to this place, but it is really open to any of us, what-
ever path we walk. For magical forms can come and go and,
as ROC pointed out,will come and go, but the magical place
of interconnectedness and love where we can stand in col-
laboration with the world is always available to us. Learning
how to go to that place and stand there and be a sacred mage
in service to all life:that is the new magic. Its secrets are in
each of us. From that place we can step into any magical or
ritual form.When we do, the magic that is forever and always
in us will enliven and enlighten the magic that is potential in
the form.
This is the vision that John Michael Greer offers. He is
truly one of the New Magicians.
ROC would have been pleased.

### INTRODUCTION

```
When the founders of the Druid Revival began the long pro-
cess of creating modern Druidry back in the early eighteenth
century, magic was very nearly the last thing on their minds.
Like many people of their time, they watched the birth of the
Industrial Age and the first stirrings of today’s environmen-
tal crises, and they recognized that the cultural forces driv-
ing humanity apart from nature would never be able to solve
the problems humans were causing. Faced with a Hobson’s
choice between dogmatic religion and materialist science,
they took a third path,drawing inspiration from the legacy
of the ancient Celtic Druids to craft a new spirituality of
nature.It never seems to have occurred to them, however,
that magic might be part of that path.
At that time, the magical traditions of the Western world
were at their lowest ebb in many centuries. Gone were the
heady days of the Renaissance, when great mages such as Para-
celsus, Cornelius Agrippa, and Giordano Bruno proclaimed
the reality of magic to the world and the occult traditions
counted as a major cultural force. The scientific revolution
put paid to all that,banishing the occult vision of a cosmos
woven together by subtle threads of power and meaning and
```
Druid Magick 3rd pages.qxd 11/9/07 2:35 PM Page xiii


```
replacing it with Newton’s universe of dead matter spinning
through an infinite void. Magic still existed in the eighteenth
century—never in all of human history has there been a cul-
ture without magic—but its practitioners either lived among
the rural poor or belonged to an underworld of secretive
magical lodges on the fringes of contemporary culture.
A few of the founders of the Druid Revival had contacts
with the old magical wisdom, but those traditions played no
role worth noticing in the creation of Druidry. Not until the
great revival of occultism in the late nineteenth century did
the first magical practices start finding their way into the
Druid movement, and it took most of a century thereafter
for magic to become a significant part of the modern Druid
tradition.Even today, some of the more conservative Druid
Revival orders will have nothing to do with magic.
Still,magic has a valid place in Druidry today. Partly, of
course, the ancient Celtic Druids who provided the original
inspiration for the Revival,and whose example still guides it
today, had a reputation all through ancient times as first-rate
magicians. Partly, the Western world’s rejection of magic has
much more to do with the crisis of industrial civilization
than the founders of the Druid Revival ever guessed.
On another level, however, magic belongs in Druidry
because the core principles of Druidry and magic are the
same. Both unfold from the awareness that the world around
us is a community to which we belong, not a commodity we
can own. Both recognize that subtle connections weave
every part of the cosmos together and offer us unexpected
ways to sense and shape the flowof events. Both realize that
our fate is a co-creation of our actions and the patterns of
space, time, and meaning that define the world around us.
```
```

```
Druid Magick 3rd pages.qxd 11/9/07 2:35 PM Page xiv


```
That these principles also form the foundations of ecology
stands as a sign of their wider importance.
Still, magic plays a less central role in Druidry than it
does in some other alternative spiritualities today. The core
practices of the Druid path remain what they were in the
eighteenth century: daily life lived in harmony with nature,
seasonal rituals that celebrate the cycles of nature, and med-
itation to unveil the secrets of our own nature. Magic com-
bines well with all of these but cannot replace any of them.
Nor is magic necessarily part of every Druid’s path, for many
other arts—poetry, music, divination, healing, sacred geom-
etry, and the study of ancient traditions of the sacred land-
scape,among others—have long been part of the Druid
tradition, and each Druid chooses from these and other
options in creating his or her personal approach to Druid
nature spirituality.
For those who hear its call, however, magic offers possi-
bilities that few other Druid arts can equal. Just as the ban-
ishing of magic by industrial society has deep connections
with the failures of vision that put our civilization on a colli-
sion course with ecological reality,the rebirth of Druid
magic has immense potential as a tool for healing the split
between humanity and nature and dissolving the trance that
blinds us to our oneness with the living Earth.

A Few Words about Authenticity
One of the questions I field most often as a teacher of
Druidry is “Where do today’s Druid teachings come from?”
Most of the people who pose that question want to know if
the Druid magic we practice today comes down directly
```
```
Introduction xv
```
Druid Magick 3rd pages.qxd 11/9/07 2:35 PM Page xv


```
from the ancient Celtic Druids, and many of them feel bit-
terly disappointed when they learn that the magic of the old
Druids vanished forever more than a thousand years ago.
We know, as it happens, that the ancient Druids prac-
ticed magic. We know almost nothing about the magic they
practiced, because all the information about the old Druids
that comes from the days when they still existed amounts to
ten pages of brief passages from Greek and Latin writers,
most of whom never met a Druid. References in legends of
Christian saints from Celtic countries and passages from
Irish legends have a little more to say, but those were writ-
ten centuries after the Druids died out, and how much
ancient lore they contain is the subject of hot debate among
scholars today. All these sources put together offer only a
few fragments of Druid magic—not enough to teach anyone
today howto practice authentic Druid magic.
Thus it deserves to be said up front that not one bit of
today’s Druid magic comes from the ancient Druids. The
teachings included in this book are no exception. They trace
their roots to the Druid Revival movement, and they evolved
to meet the needs of people practicing Druidry in the
modern world. They draw extensively on eighteenth- and
nineteenth-century Welsh Druid lore, like most Revival tra-
ditions,but also draw on other sources within and beyond
the Druid community.
All this counts as next thing to heresy in some circles.
Saying that a tradition rooted in the Druid Revival and the
Renaissance can call itself “Druid magic,” for that matter, is
bound to raise hackles in some corners of today’s alternative
spiritual scene.There are writers and teachers today who in-
sist that the value of any system of Druid practice depends
on its claim to historical authenticity. If Druid teachings
```
```
xvi Introduction
```
Druid Magick 3rd pages.qxd 11/9/07 2:35 PM Page xvi


```
don’t copy the practices of the ancient Celtic Druids as
exactly as possible, this argument goes, they must not be
worth much.
This sort of thinking has tangled roots. Many people
yearn for ways of life more richly human than the ones they
find in today’s industrial society. Such yearnings speak to
powerful needs, but a quirk of the modern imagination leads
many of those who feel the call to a better life to think they
have to find it in some other culture far from ours in space
or time. The ancient Celts have been targeted more than
most others by this sort of thinking, and as a result you can
find many books in print today that paint the Celts of the
past in the colors of Utopia.
The reality is much more nuanced. Just like ours,
ancient Celtic cultures had vices as well as virtues—societies
that had no moral problem at all with slavery and defined peo-
ple’s human value based on their social class, as the ancient
Celts did, make very poor candidates for Utopia by most
standards—and their traditions, colorful as they may seem
from a distance, aren’t all that relevant to the very different
realities of life in a declining industrial civilization.The
Celtic heritage has been a source of inspiration for modern
Druids since the first days of the Revival.Yet that inspiration
must be tempered by the knowledge that a yearning for a
richer life can’t be satisfied by idolizing somebody else’s cul-
ture or trying to pretend that you don’t belong to the one
you actually inhabit. It can only be fulfilled by the hard work
of self-knowledge—and that starts from the lived experi-
ence of your own place and time.
These issues have special relevance to magic, because a
magical tradition is first and foremost a toolkit: a set of meth-
ods and tools for making things happen. It’s not a cultural
```
```
Introduction xvii
```

```
fashion statement, a historical reenactment, or a role-playing
game, and if it becomes one of these things, it usually stops
being effective magic. Judging systems of magic on the basis
of their historical authenticity, ironically enough, is also one
of the most historically inauthentic things a mage can do,
because ancient magical traditions borrowed things from
other cultures just as enthusiastically as modern ones do.
Since magic is about making things happen, this makes per-
fect sense, because what matters in a magical system is sim-
ply whether or not it works.
All these points apply with particular force to magic as a
Druid practice. While Celtic traditions and the legacy of the
old Druids inspire modern Druids, the core concerns of
Druidry have always centered on the present and the future,
not the past. What makes Druid magic relevant today is not
whether it comes from an ancient or modern source,but
whether it can help restore harmony between humanity and
nature.If a Druid magical system can do this, that’s all the
authenticity it needs.

How to Use This Book
The Druid Magic Handbook has been written as a complete
training manual of ritual magic in the modern Druid tradi-
tion.Like my earlier book The Druidry Handbook, it draws
principally on the teachings of the Ancient Order of Druids
in America (AODA; http://www.aoda.org ), the order I serve as Grand
Archdruid. The core practices and traditions of AODA’s
Druidry are covered in that previous book, including the
symbolism and philosophy that underlies the magical system
presented here, but everything you need to work this system
```
```
xviii Introduction
```
Druid Magick 3rd pages.qxd 11/9/07 2:35 PM Page xviii


```
of Druid magic can be found between the covers of this
book.
Still, magic is only one part of the broader Druid tradi-
tion, and it works best when practiced together with Druid
nature spirituality. Membership in AODA or study of The
Druidry Handbook open doors to the wider world of Druidry,
but these are by no means the only options.The magic taught
here also combines well with the study programs of other
traditional Druid orders such as the Order of Bards Ovates
and Druids (OBOD; http://www.druidry.org ) and the Druid Gor-
sedd of the First Circle (DGOFC; http://www.dgofc.org ).Books such
as Philip Carr-Gomm’s The Druid Way are also good sources
for such explorations.
Not all of the modern Druid movement shares this much
common ground, however. Some recently founded Druid
traditions reject the heritage of the Revival,and work with
current academic reconstructions of ancient Celtic religion
instead. People who prefer this approach to Druidry may
find some aspects of the magical work in this book a poor fit
with their beliefs. The same will likely be true of followers
of other nature-centered religions,such as Wicca,and other
traditions of modern magic, such as Hermeticism. I have
done my best to make the magic taught in these pages as
accessible and inclusive as possible, but no book can be all
things to all people.
The eight chapters of this book move through a care-
fully designed sequence of magical workings, starting from
the essential theory and basic practices of Druid magic and
proceeding from there through a sequence of progressively
more demanding magical workings. If you want to skip
around while reading, by all means do that, but if you choose
```
```
Introduction xix
```
Druid Magick 3rd pages.qxd 11/9/07 2:35 PM Page xix


```
to take up the course of study this book provides, it’s impor-
tant to start at the beginning and work your way through the
book a chapter at a time. All the workings in the later chap-
ters are assembled from concepts, rituals, and practices
taught early on, and some of the advanced rituals will not
work at all unless you do the preliminary practices first.This
will likely be true even if you already know another tradition
of magic, because Druid magic starts from different princi-
ples than most other magical traditions and gathers power
from its own distinctive sources.
Patience is essential to the work presented in this book,
then. So is your willingness to invest time in the magical
practices and studies in this book.Learning magic takes time
and practice,just like learning a musical instrument, a mar-
tial art, or anything else worth doing. Plan on setting aside
twenty to thirty minutes a day, each and every day, for your
magical training, as well as periods of up to an hour for mag-
ical workings every week or so. If this is more than you can
do, this may not be the right time in your life for you to take
up magic, and it makes more sense to accept that and set
your sights on something within reach than to go through
the motions of magical training without any likelihood of
getting results.
The other requirements for Druid magic are straightfor-
ward. You will need a place to practice magic, but a spare
corner of a bedroom or a backyard will meet that require-
ment.You will also need a few simple magical tools. A set of
Ogham sticks or cards, an altar, four small bowls or caul-
drons,eight small stones,a wand,another small cauldron,
and a bag that can be hung around your neck form the com-
plete toolkit for this book. All of them can be made or
bought inexpensively.

### PART ONE

## The Foundations of Druid Magic



## Chapter 1 The Ways of the Life Force

Max Weber, in his famous 1904 book, _The Protestant Ethic and
the Spirit of Capitalism,_ gave a startling name to one of the
realities of modern life: “the disenchantment of the world.”
Weber was a sociologist who studied the impact of indus-
trial society on human thought. Before scientific materialism
seized the imagination of Western culture,he pointed out,
people saw the world around them as a place full of magic,
where trees and stones could speak, birds traced out the shape
of the future in their flight, and those who knew the secret
could sense and shape the flowof enchantment in the world
around them.This living, breathing, magical world was one
of the first casualties of the Industrial Revolution. As mate-
rialist beliefs spread, magic trickled out of the world, trans-
forming it—at least in most people’s minds—into a mass of
lifeless matter relevant only as a source of raw materials or a
place to dump waste.
Like most educated people of his time,Weber did not
believe in magic. He meant the word _disenchantment_ as a
metaphor, and he saw the banishing of magic and meaning
from the world as a necessary part of progress and the end
of an ancient illusion. Still, he recognized that the psycholog-
ical and spiritual price of progress weighed heavily on the


modern world—heavily enough, perhaps, to outweigh its
material benefits. In a disenchanted world, he showed, even
the most basic human values lose their anchor, and the only
things left are the mechanical values of profit and efficiency,
the basis for what passes for rational thought in a modern
industrial society.
The irony of the phrase is that Weber spoke more truth
than he realized. Neither he nor most of his readers saw dis-
enchantment as anything but a metaphor. Still, those who
know the living power of magic know that Weber’s phrase
points to a crucial reality. Our world is literally disenchanted.
It suffers from a shortage of enchantment that cuts people
off from magical realities and makes their lives less meaning-
ful and magical than they could be.
_Enchantment_ is the art of awakening spiritual presences in
material things.The word literally means “putting a song in
something”—en _-chant-_ ment—a turn of phrase that reflects
the living experience of a world in which every part of the
landscape and every turn of the seasonal cycle sings its mean-
ing to the awakened mind. In traditional societies around the
world and throughout history,enchantment has had a vital
role in bringing people into harmony with their gods, their
environment, and their communities. Magic provided the
toolkit for creating and maintaining enchantment. Using
magic, the priestesses and wizards of the past wove nature
and humanity into a single fabric that kept both balanced and
whole.
As far as anyone knows, the Industrial Revolution marks
the first time in human history that a civilization tried to
banish enchantment from the world. When Weber assessed
the results of this experiment in 1904, cracks were already
showing in the bright facade of progress. Now, more than a
century later, the collapse of communities and collective

**_4_** Part One: The Foundations of Druid Magic


spiritual life across the Western world has been joined by the
specter of catastrophic environmental change. Dwindling
fossil fuel reserves, massive ecological changes, and wild
swings in the world’s climate announce the coming of an age
of payback in which the survival of industrial civilization
itself stands at risk.
A little more than forty years have passed now since the
environmental crisis first forced itself onto newspaper head-
lines around the world. During that time, a great many histo-
rians have traced the roots of our civilization’s dysfunctional
relationship with nature, and an even larger number of
activists have proposed solutions. Magic has rarely seen men-
tion in either context.A handful of perceptive writers have
followed Weber’s lead and traced out the connections
between a way of thinking about the Earth that strips it of
enchantment and a way of acting toward it that strips it of
everything else. In _The Reenchantment of the World,_ one of the
best books of this kind, Morris Berman comments:

```
For more than 99 percent of human history, the
world was enchanted and man saw himself as an
integral part of it.The complete reversal of this per-
ception in a mere four hundred years or so has
destroyed the continuity of the human experience
and the integrity of the human psyche. It has very
nearly wrecked the planet as well.The only hope, or
so it seems to me, lies in a reenchantment of the
world. (Berman, 1981, p. 10)
```
Yet neither Berman nor the handful of other writers
who have pursued these themes have considered the possi-
bility that the best way to reenchant the world is to use the
same magical methods that enchanted it in the first place.

The Ways of the Life Force **_5_**


Berman himself claims that “we cannot go back to alchemy
or animism” (ibid.). Behind this argument stands the immense
emotional force of the modern faith in progress, with its
conviction that “going back” is the one unforgivable sin.Yet if
a traveler on unfamiliar roads finds that he has gone down a
blind alley, the only option that will get him out of it is to go
back the way he came.
From the perspective of Druidry, a return to magic is sim-
ple common sense. Modern Druidry itself was born alongside
the Industrial Revolution, crafted by a handful of British
visionaries in the early eighteenth century, who saw the first
stirrings of today’s ecological crises and recognized that the
gap between humanity and nature opened by industrial soci-
ety had to be healed ifWestern civilization were to survive.
The founders of the Druid Revival took the radical step of
embracing the name and legacy of the ancient Celtic Druids
at a time when “going back” in religious matters was as
unthinkable as doing the same thing scientifically and tech-
nologically is today.They recognized that what matters about
ideas is not how new they are, or for that matter how old
they are,but whether they reflect truth in a way that meets
the needs of humanity and nature in a particular age.
The revival of magic in recent decades thus speaks to
one of the most critical needs of our time.While magic can-
not solve today’s ecological crisis by itself, it offers crucial
tools for healing the gap between humanity and nature. To
understand how magic can accomplish this, and to begin
making sense of magic itself, we need to pay attention to a
part of human experience that hasdropped entirely out of
modern awareness.

**The Mind-Body Problem**
For the past four hundred years, one of the major intellec-
tual puzzles in the Western world has been what philoso-
phers call “the mind-body problem.” Like most of the really
tough conundrums of philosophy, the problem can be stated
simply enough. In Western cultures, most people experience
themselves as two very different things—a material body, on
the one hand, and an apparently nonmaterial mind, self, per-
sonality, or soul on the other.The problem is how to explain
the connection between them.
Theories about the relationship between mind and body
nearly allfall into two camps.The first approach, called _dual-
ism,_ claims that there are two completely separate realms of
existence,one mental,one material, that somehow come
into contact inside each human being and nowhere else in
the cosmos.The other, called _reductionism,_ claims that only one
of them is real,and then finds some way to explain away the
other.
Arguments over the mind-body problem have swung
like a pendulum from dualist to reductionist viewpoints and
back again. Nowadays reductionist approaches are in vogue,
and most scientists and many laypeople accept the reduc-
tionist claim that mind is a side effect of the physical body’s
nervous system. This latter notion is quite often presented
these days as simple common sense. Like most things labeled
“common sense,” however, it relies on a whole series of
assumptions that may not bear close examination.
The pendulum keeps swinging because dualism and
reductionism both have serious problems. Entire books have
been written about these problems, and since they don’t
bear directly on the subject of magic, they can be left to stu-
dents of the history of ideas. What makes the wild swings of

The Ways of the Life Force **_7_**


this intellectual pendulum relevant here is that they started
abruptly with the birth of materialist science in the seven-
teenth century.
Before then, people understood the relationship between
mind and body in a very different way. They experienced
themselves as three things, not two. A third factor—the life
force—existed between mind and body and linked them
together. In the magical traditions of the Renaissance, this
force was called “spirit,” from the Latin word _spiritus,_
“breath.” To this older way of thinking, spirit is the source of
life, energy, and vitality, enlivening the dense matter of the
body and connecting it with the mind. In the Renaissance
view, spirit surrounds and penetrates all material things,
uniting them and weaving the universe into a whole.
If this description sounds like something from a very
famous movie,there’s good reason for that. George Lucas
borrowed the concept of “the Force,” the power used by the
Jedi Knights of his _StarWars_ movies,from teachings about
the life force in the Japanese martial arts, where it is called
_ki_ and has exactly the same properties Renaissance mages
assigned to spirit.
The Druid name for the life force is _nwyfre_ (pronounced
“NOO-iv-ruh”). Nearly every other language on Earth has a
word for it, too. The only languages that don’t are the ones
spoken in the industrial nations of the modern West.
The banishing of the life force from the worldview of
industrial society is no accident. The founders of modern
materialist science fought hard to keep their newborn ideol-
ogy free of any trace of the life force,and you can still reduce
most scientists to spluttering indignation by mentioning it.
Anything that strays too close to vitalism, as modern
philosophers call the idea of a life force, comes in for unre-

**_8_** Part One: The Foundations of Druid Magic


lenting criticism. A great part of the prejudice against alter-
native healing arts in the modern Western world comes from
the fact that most of them, unlike the current medical main-
stream, treat the life force as a reality and use it to heal.
Thus there’s a deep irony in the past four centuries of de-
bate over the mind-body problem. The relationship between
mind and body poses no problem at all outside the modern
industrial worldview, because anywhere people recognize
the existence of the life force,its role in connecting mind

and body is obvious.The relationship only became a problem
in the Western world when materialist science threw out the
connecting link. It’s as though the first modern scientists
decided that their chests didn’t exist, and then spent four cen-
turies arguing about what could possibly connect their heads
with their bellies.
What makes this all the more fascinating is that the life
force is not just a theory or a belief. It’s something we expe-
rience in the same way that we experience our minds and
bodies. Outside the industrial West, the life force is just as
much a part of life as bodies and minds are. In modern
Japan, for example, people still talk about the state of their
_ki_ on an everyday basis. The word for courage in Japanese is
_yuki,_ literally“active ki”; depression is _fukeiki,_ “sluggish ki”;a
strong personality is described by the words _kisho ga tsuyoi,_
“the quality of his ki is strong”;and illness is _byoki,_ “disturbed
ki.” The same sort of talk was every bit as common in
medieval and Renaissance Europe,and it’s just as common in
most other traditional societies.
This same way of experiencing the world also has in-
tensely practical consequences.Asian martial arts,for exam-
ple, treat the life force as an essential factor and use special
training methods to strengthen and direct it.When a martial
artist breaks a pine board with a punch or shatters a stack of
bricks with a palm strike, the life force flowing into the strik-
ing hand does the job. A way of looking at the world that
enables flesh and bone to shatter wood and brick is clearly
something more than a primitive superstition.
People who experience the life force as an everyday real-
ity have no special “sixth sense” lacking in those of us who
live in industrial societies. We dwell in the same world and
have the same potentials for awareness that they do. The dif-

**_10_** Part One: The Foundations of Druid Magic


ference is that their vision of reality makes room for the life
force, and ours does not. Children in traditional societies
learn to pay attention to the life force in themselves and the
world because the people around them notice it, talk about
it, and treat it as a reality. Children in industrial societies
learn not to pay attention to it in exactly the same way. Even
so, when people in the modern industrial world talk about
gut feelings and hunches, or the “vibes” or “feel” of a person
or a place,most of the time they are talking about their own
perceptions of flow and pattern in the life force.
The life force is close enough to the surface of awareness
that various simple exercises can make most people con-
scious of it in a few minutes.Here is an example. Read through
the following paragraph, and then do the exercise before you
read any further.
Start by standing comfortably with your feet parallel or
a little toed out, your heels a foot or so apart, and your knees
slightly bent. Let your hands hang at your sides, and shake
them for a full minute, making them as loose and floppy as
possible. Then rub them together for another full minute,
keeping them relaxed as you rub.Then hold them in front of
you, palms facing one another, as if you were holding a bas-
ketball in front of your chest. Breathe slowly and deeply, keep
your hands and arms relaxed, and concentrate on your
palms. After a full minute of this, begin moving your hands
toward and away from each other a short distance, no more
than an inch. This is the final step. Keep doing it for a little
while,and see what you notice.
What did you experience? Most people, when they do
the exercise the first time, as they move their hands back and
forth, feel a gentle pressure against their palms, as though
their hands were magnets repelling each other. The longer

The Ways of the Life Force **_11_**


the back-and-forth motion continues, the stronger the sen-
sation of pressure becomes, and if you do the same exercise
daily for a week or more, the sensation becomes as firm as if
you held a physical object between your palms.
What you feel pressing against your hands, according to
the magical view of the world, is the field of life force
between energy centers in your palms. Shaking, rubbing, and
relaxation, the basis of the exercise, release muscular tensions
that block the flow of life force through your body, so that the
fields around your hands become strong enough that you
notice them. Those fields are always there, whether you
notice them or not, and so are similar fields that radiate out
from other centers in your body, filling a roughly egg-shaped
space that extends a fewfeet out from you in all directions.
Every living thing has a similar field, and so do many of the
things people in the industrial world consider nonliving.
As the bridge between mind and matter, the life force can
be influenced in many ways using mind,matter, or the two in
combination. The exercise you just performed uses body
movements to shape the flow of nwyfre. This is a traditional
and powerful way of working with the life force.Martial arts
and Eastern systems of spiritual practice such as yoga and
qigong rely on this and also on breathing exercises, another
classic method.Other spiritual and magical systems rely on
physical substances that concentrate certain qualities in
nwyfre, or on a knowledge of the times and places where
nwyfre flows most strongly.
Ritual magic approaches the life force from a different
way—the way ofimagination.This is another aspect of reality
that has come in for more than its fair share of neglect by mod-
ern thinkers; to call something “imaginary” nowadays, after
all,is to say that it’s unreal.Yet imagination is a potent reality.

**_12_** Part One: The Foundations of Druid Magic


Imagination, in fact, is the human mind’s way of experi-
encing patterns in the life force. When you imagine some-
thing, that image takes shape in the life force around you.
The more powerfully you imagine it, the more strongly the
image shapes the life force. This equation works the other
way as well. When an unexpected thought or feeling drifts
into your mind, most of the time what has happened is that
you picked up a pattern in the life force created by some
other mind.The movement of patterns in life force from
mind to mind explains most psychic phenomena, as well as
less controversial experiences such as the spread of fads and
fashions and the behavior of crowds. It also explains the
workings of ritual magic.
You can begin to see how this works by repeating the
same exercise you just did with a slight difference.When you
move your hands to face each other, imagine that an actual
ball appears between your palms. See it, but also imagine the
feeling of it pressing against your palms, and notice the tex-
ture of the ball’s surface. Concentrate on the imaginary ball
as intensely as you can for a full minute, and then start mov-
ing your hands toward and away from each other slightly,as
before. Do this now, before you read any further.
What did you experience when you started moving your
hands back and forth? Most people find that the sensation of
pressure becomes much more intense once mental imagery
comes into play. If you do the same exercise daily for a week
or more with the mental imagery, and then try just imagin-
ing the ball without any of the preliminary movements,
you’ll find that you can sense the fields of life force as soon
as you bring your hands together.
This simple process contains the art of ritual magic in
miniature. Visualizing the ball and bringing your hands

The Ways of the Life Force **_13_**


together is a simple ritual. The more you practice it, the
more readily the life force responds to it, and magical results
follow.

**Magic and Nature**
In Welsh Druid tradition, nwyfre—the life force—is one of
three basic principles of existence. The other two are _gwyar_
(pronounced “GOO-yar”), the principle of flow, and _calas_
(pronounced “CAH-luss”), the principle of matter. Lift your
hand in front of your face and all three elements are right in
front of you. Calas is the physical substance of the hand—the
skin,flesh,and bone that make it a material object. Gwyar is
the movement and flow of the hand—the motion that brings
it in front of your face, to begin with, but also the circulation
of blood and lymph,and all the other subtle motions that
make it what it is. Nwyfre is the life, vitality, and sensation
of the hand—the presence of the life force that makes it a
living, active, and sensitive thing rather than a dead object.
According to these same Druid traditions, these three
things exist in everything in the world.A stone contains gwyar
and nwyfre as well as calas; stone flows very slowly, and its
life is hard for human beings to perceive, but both are there.
A fall breeze contains calas in the form of molecules of oxy-
gen,nitrogen, and other gases, as well as dust and water
vapor; gwyar in the form of the movement that sweeps these
molecules along; and nwyfre in the form of a simple life and
awareness that old magical textbooks call a _sylph,_ or air ele-
mental.These and everything else in the world have a basis
in matter, a pattern of flow, and an indwelling life: calas,
gwyar, and nwyfre, in the language of Druid magic.
The living Earth herself is no exception to this rule. She
includes calas in the form of all the solid, liquid, and gaseous

**_14_** Part One: The Foundations of Druid Magic


matter drawn together by gravity into this little corner of
space; gwyar in the form of all the intricate tapestry of move-
ment in, on, and around the Earth, from the great arc of its
orbit around the Sun to the wriggling of the smallest single-
celled organism in her oceans and soil; and nwyfre in the
form of the common life that Renaissance occultists called
_spiritus mundi,_ the earth spirit, and many modern ecologists
call _Gaia._
The force that makes magic work, in other words, is just
as much a part of nature as matter and motion.This isn’t the
way most people in the modern world think about magic, of
course. Ask most people who have never practiced magic
what it is,and the word _supernatural_ usually shows up in the
answer—meaning, among other things, that magic violates
the laws of nature.The magic done by characters in films and
fantasy novels does this,and most skeptics have this sort of
magic in mind when they reject it as impossible. This just
doesn’t happen to be the sort of magic that mages—people
who do magic—actually practice.
Real magic is natural, not supernatural. It unfolds from
the natural force of nwyfre,and its effects follow natural pat-
terns and obey the laws of nature. Thus magic won’t make
rocks fall upward or apple trees bear tomatoes, it won’t
make matter or energy appear from nowhere or disappear
without a trace, and if you were born with brown hair, magic
won’t make it blonde; you’ll have to use hair dye instead.
Magic can start, stop, speed up, or slow down anything in
nature—including human nature—within the broad limits
nature herself sets on those processes. What nature doesn’t
do, however, magic won’t do either.
Accounts of what mages actually do make this point with
a high degree of clarity. One of the very best resources along
these lines is Vine Deloria Jr.’s extraordinary 2006 book _The_

The Ways of the Life Force **_15_**


_World We Used to Live In,_ a collection of accounts of native
medicine people and their powers, ranging from the subtle
to the spectacular. Deloria’s examples include all the things
that mages around the world have always done—healing ill-
nesses, finding hidden objects, communicating with birds and
animals, shaping weather, making crops fertile, perceiving
things distant in space and time, and causing vivid sensory
hallucinations in other people. Each of these things happens
in keeping with the ordinary patterns of nature, even when
the connection between magical cause and physical effect
can’t be explained by current scientific theories.
Consider a type of magic that sorcerers and shamans
have done for thousands of years: a ritual for rain. Nobody
who does this kind of magic claims that a successful ritual
makes rain fall miraculously out of a clear blue sky. Instead,
the barometric pressure drops, the wind shifts, clouds roll
in, and rain starts to fall in the normal way. The result looks
just like any ordinary rainstorm.It’s the way that rain
responds to the ritual that makes it magical.
Thus, what makes magic magical, in other words—and
what makes materialist skeptics reject it with such heat—is
simply that it challenges modern assumptions about cause
and effect. Most scientists believe that material effects must
have material causes, and the idea that an intention held in the
mind,channeled through nwyfre, can set off effects in nature
is unthinkable to them.The fact that this is an everyday expe-
rience for mages does nothing to make it more palatable!
Still, only the role of nwyfre in bridging the gap between
mind and matter goes beyond what current scientific theories
can explain. Once the ritual gives the rain a starting push, the
rest of the process unfolds like any other storm.
One interesting effect of this principle is that skeptics
can always insist that the results of magic might be coinci-

**_16_** Part One: The Foundations of Druid Magic


dence.When a shaman works a rain spell, it could be coinci-
dence that a rainstorm rolls in a few hours later. If the same
spell works a hundred times in a row, it could still be coinci-
dence. As long as the rain spell gets the results the shaman
wants, it hardly matters, and indeed magic could almost be
defined as the art of causing coincidences in accordance with
intention.Think about how many important things in life are
governed by what modern people call “coincidence,” and you
may begin to grasp the astonishing power magic has to shape
the universe of human experience.
Still,recognizing that magic is part of nature and gov-
erned by natural limits is a crucial step in using it wisely.
Neither magic nor anything else in nature has unlimited
power. Magic is not a ticket to godhood or a substitute for
the more basic disciplines of spiritual practice. It’s simply a
useful and powerful craft that,like several other traditional
crafts, blends well with Druid spiritual practices and a life in
harmony with nature. In a world where enchantment is in
short supply, however, the gifts magic can offer are desper-
ately needed.

**Magic and Intentionality**
These considerations are important because harmony with
nature is one of the essential principles of Druid magic.With
two other themes, symbolism and intentionality, it forms a
triad of principles that underlie everything in this book.
Symbolism has a role in magic complex enough that it needs
a chapter of its own; it is covered in detail in chapter 2 of
this book. Intentionality is simpler, but it has depths that
many students of magic miss.
For just over a century and a half, most books on magic
in the Western world have talked about intentionality in terms

The Ways of the Life Force **_17_**


of the development and use of the magical will.This habit goes
back to the great nineteenth-century French occultist Eliphas
Lévi, whose writings launched the modern revival of magic.
Lévi got the idea of the magical will from the German
philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer, one of the few thinkers of
his time to accept the possibility of magic. Schopenhauer saw
the universe as the product of a cosmic will creating repre-
sentations in the minds of beings. In Lévi’s writings, this
dance of will and representation became a recipe for magi-
cal power that used will and imagination to shape the world.
In Lévi’s wake, many students of magic came to see mag-
ical training as a matter of building up vast reserves of
willpower and using them to force the universe to do their
bidding.This was not what Lévi meant, as it happens, but
some of the colorful language Lévi used to express his ideas
helped foster the idea that magic was basically a way of
browbeating the universe into getting what you want, when,
where,and howyou want it. This sort of thinking became
popular in magical circles because it resonated with popular
ideologies of the time that celebrated humanity’s supposed
“conquest”of nature.
Like the attitude that sees nature as something to con-
quer, however, this approach to magic has serious problems.
Because it ignores the momentum and flow of natural pat-
terns, it’s clumsy and wasteful of energy. It’s much like try-
ing to cross a lake on a rowboat without paying attention to
the winds and currents. If you ignore these, you can put
plenty of effort into rowing and make very little headway, or
even end up further away from your goal than you started.
Many people who reject this approach go to the opposite
extreme and embrace a passive approach to the spiritual
world.Most mainstream religions in the Western world, for
example, insist that magic is wrong and people ought instead

**_18_** Part One: The Foundations of Druid Magic


to pray to a god and then prayerfully accept whatever the
god decides to send them. This latter claim, to return to our
boating metaphor, is like trying to cross a lake on a rowboat
by throwing the oars overboard and trusting the winds and
currents to get you to the other side. If you do that, you may
cross the lake or you may not, and an attitude of prayerful
acceptance of whatever happens is probably a good idea!
These two ideas form what Druid philosophy calls a “bi-
nary.” A binary is a pair of ideas, factors, or forces in opposi-
tion to each other. Binaries exert a curious magnetism on
the human mind.Once we get caught up in thoughts of yes
or no, right or wrong, love or hate, truth or falsehood, or
any other binary, it can be hard to realize that the two poles
of the binary don’t contain all of reality. The two attitudes
just outlined make an excellent example of a binary, because
both are extreme positions masquerading as the only two
options.
Druid philosophy offers a useful tactic in situations of
this kind.When you encounter a binary, you simply look for
a third factor that is not simply a midpoint between the two
poles.Find the third factor and you convert the binary into
a _ternary,_ a balanced threefold relationship that allows free-
dom and flexibility.
In this case,the third factor that resolves the binary into
a ternary is knowledge. If you learn how to read the winds and
currents, you can work with them rather than against them.
You can choose a time when the wind is blowing in the direc-
tion you want to go and row yourself into a current that moves
in the same direction. As your knowledge develops, you can
even turn one oar into a mast, use the other one as a rudder,
find a piece of cloth to serve as a sail, and go skimming
across the lake with one hand on the tiller and a fair wind
doing all the work.

The Ways of the Life Force **_19_**


This last approach is the way of Druid magic. Because
Druid mages know that they are part of nature, participating
in the great dance of life, they pay attention to the move-
ments of that dance and use those movements to get where
they want to go. Rather than trying to force the world to do
what they want, or sitting around waiting for someone else
to do it for them, they learn to make contact with the cur-
rents of nwyfre that flow through the world, catch these in
the “sails” of their magic, and ride them to their destination.
This is how the magical will actually works. It has noth-
ing in common with Victorian notions of willpower but the
word _will._ Think of someone exerting willpower, and what
comes to mind? Someone with clenched jaw, white knuck-
les,narrowed eyes, and rigid muscles? All these signs of con-
flict betray weakness, not strength. Real will is effortless. It
corresponds,not to struggle and strain, but to what philoso-
phers call “intentionality,” the orientation of the mind that
locates meaning in objects of experience.
An old Hindu metaphor helps show how this works.
Imagine that you are walking in the forest and see what looks
like a poisonous snake coiled up beside the trail.Heart pound-
ing and muscles ready to jump, you make a wide circle
around it, and only then see that it is actually a coil of rope.
The object was the same all along, but your mind gave it two
radically different intentionalities. When the intentionality
changed, everything about your experience changed except
the thing you were experiencing.
You may not be able choose whether the coiled thing
beside the trail is a snake or a rope.If you face a window and
look toward it, however, you can look _through_ the window at
the scenery outside, or you can look _at_ the window and exam-

**_20_** Part One: The Foundations of Druid Magic


ine the glass, frame, and so on. If you look at the scenery it can
be very hard to notice the window glass, and if you look at the
glass it can be just as hard to notice the scenery. Is the glass a
way of seeing outside or something to look at in its own right?
It can be either one, and the difference is intentionality.
Many things in life can be shaped even more powerfully
by your choice of intentionality. If you face a challenge with
confidence, for example, your chances of success are much
better than if you face the same challenge full of doubts and
worries. Intentionality is the reason why.What the confident
person sees as potential opportunities, the worried person
sees as potential obstacles, and they are both right, because
whether something is an opportunity or an obstacle usually
depends on how you choose to approach it.
Magical philosophy goes one step further than this,
because _nwyfre follows intentionality._ When your mind locates
meaning in something, nwyfre picks up and amplifies that
meaning. The more intense the experience of meaning, the
stronger the flow of nwyfre it sets in motion, and the more
likely it is to shape other people’s experiences as well as yours.
The difference between intentionality and ordinary ideas
of willpower explains many of the failures that bedevil begin-
ners.When you try to use magic to will the world into obedi-
ence,you set up an intentionality of conflict between yourself
and the world. Nwyfre follows that intentionality, and you
find yourself embroiled in conflict with everything around
you. The harder you try to make the world obey, the more it
fights back,because all your efforts reinforce the intentiona-
lity and amplify the conflict. Change your intentionality to
one of moving in harmony with the world, and the conflict
disappears.

The Ways of the Life Force **_21_**


The same effect shapes magic’s practical applications.
Many beginners, for example, try to use magic to achieve
financial prosperity, and it’s common for their efforts to
backfire and leave them poorer than they started. Why? In
many cases, their magic focuses on wanting what they don’t
have. This sets up an intentionality of wanting and not hav-
ing, and so they end up wanting money and not having it. As
with so many things in life, the more energy they put into
chasing something, the faster it runs away.
If you want to use magic to become prosperous, your
intentionality has to focus on _being_ prosperous, not on _want-
ing_ to be prosperous. One effective approach starts with not-
icing the prosperity already in your life—if you have a roof
over your head, three meals a day, and the leisure to read this
book, after all, you have more prosperity than half the people
on this planet—and letting the change in focus from wanting
to having gently redefine your intentionality toward wealth.
Another useful strategy focuses on seeing opportunities for
abundance around you. This redefines your surroundings as a
source of opportunity, and as nwyfre follows intentionality
and shapes experience,opportunities appear.

**Magic and Ethics**
Intentionality also underlies the ethics of magic. This is con-
troversial territory, because there is no consensus in the
occult community about what magical ethics should be, or
even whether they exist at all. Some traditions and teachers
claim that using magic for anything but pure spiritual
advancement is a fatal fall from grace, while others insist that
the sole point of magic is fulfilling all one’s most selfish
desires. From a Druid perspective, this is simply another

**_22_** Part One: The Foundations of Druid Magic


binary, and practical ethics provide the third factor that
resolves it into a ternary.
The phrase “practical ethics” may seem strange, but this
shows just how confused today’s culture has become. Ethics
have nothing to do with the pie-in-the-sky idealism and obe-
dience training too often marketed under that label. Rather,
ethics teach practical rules of behavior that explain what
works and what doesn’t. It’s not idealism to point out that if
a stove burner is hot enough to cook your dinner, it’s hot
enough to burn your hand, and there’s no freedom to be
gained by breaking the rules of sanitation. Ethics work in
exactly the same way.
This is especially true of magical ethics. Consider a curse
meant to bring misfortune on someone.This sort of magic has
a long and ugly history behind it, and it works by setting up an
intentionality that turns everything in the target’s environ-
ment into a source of harm. Done with skill and intensity, it
can have highly unpleasant results. The risks are just as
unpleasant, however, because magic is like raspberry jam; you
can’t spread it on anything without getting some on yourself.
Thus it’s proverbial that people who make a habit of destruc-
tive magic end up poor, despised, and marginal, because their
workings have predictable effects on their own lives.
This happens because intentionality doesn’t just affect
the target of a magical working. It defines a whole system
that includes the mage, the target, and the whole environ-
ment. In a magical curse, the intentionality defines the tar-
get as a person who suffers misfortune,but it also defines
the environment as a source of misfortune, and the mage as
a person who causes misfortune. As a result, the mage be-
comes more likely to cause misfortune even when he doesn’t
want to, and the environment becomes more likely to be a

The Ways of the Life Force **_23_**


source of misfortune to the caster as well as the target. If the
mage keeps doing such workings, the object may be differ-
ent each time, but subject and environment stay the same,
and eventually the mage starts having trouble causing any-
thing but misfortune, even in her own life, or experiencing
her environment as anything but a source of misfortune.
The same process shapes the results you will get from less
obviously corrupt forms of magic. Prosperity magic of the
sort mentioned in the previous section makes another good
example, because many magical novices think of these work-
ings as a way of getting an unearned financial windfall of some
kind. The problem with trying to get something for nothing,
in a world of limited resources, is that for somebody to get
money and not earn it, somebody else must earn the money
and not get it. This intentionality defines a whole system, and
the keynote of that system is economic unfairness. People who
do magic of this kind thus routinely end up on the receiving
end of various kinds of economic unfairness,and quite often
lose more than the windfall they hoped to gain.
Of course intentionality works the other way just as
effectively.This is one reason that so many traditional occult
schools encourage students to study and practice some form
of healing. The intentionality of healing, like that of cursing
or getting something for nothing, defines a whole system,
but it defines the healers as people who bring healing rather
than misfortune or unfairness, and it defines their environ-
ment as a resource for healing. This helps bring healing to
themselves as well as to others.
The moral to this story,sotospeak,is that the much-
maligned Golden Rule—Do to others what you would want
them to do to you—makes a useful touchstone for the ethics
of your magical work. If you object to having a particular kind

**_24_** Part One: The Foundations of Druid Magic


of magical working aimed at you, it’s rarely if ever appropri-
ate to aim the same sort of magic at anybody else.
If, as many Druids believe, the principles of magic are
ultimately the same as the laws of ecology, one of the lessons
of today’s environmental crisis also has a good deal of rele-
vance here. You can only dump so much pollution into the
biosphere before it shows up in the food you eat, the water
you drink, and the air you breathe. From this perspective,
unethical magic is simply one more kind of pollution, and the
things that usually motivate it—ignorance, arrogance, and
shortsighted greed—are the same factors pushing our indus-
trial civilization into a bruising collision with ecological real-
ity today.

**Solar and Telluric Currents**
As the link between mind and matter and the power behind
the magical uses of intentionality, nwyfre stands at the heart
of Druid magic. Understand the ways of nwyfre and you
know all you need to know about the magical arts. This is
less easy than it sounds, however. Nwyfre fills the whole uni-
verse, and every mental process and material object in the
universe affects it in one way or another. To know its ways
completely would therefore take a working knowledge of
everything in the cosmos.
Fortunately some of the things that influence nwyfre have
much more potent effects than others.The most powerful, for
our purposes, are the two primary sources of nwyfre in the
little corner of the universe where human beings live. One
of these is the Sun, and the other is the heart of the Earth.
From these spring the two primary currents of nwyfre used
by Druid magic: the solar and telluric currents.

The Ways of the Life Force **_25_**


The solar current descends to the Earth’s upper atmos-
phere from the Sun and cascades from there down to the
surface. It waxes and wanes according to the position of the
Sun in the sky, reaching maximum strength at dawn and noon,
but it is present even at midnight; it flows wherever light
from the sky can reach, and even penetrates a short distance
down into the soil. The other planets of the solar system
reflect the solar current to Earth just as they reflect the Sun’s
light,and their cycles shape the flow of the solar current in
ways that can be tracked by astrology and other magical tra-
ditions of time. The solar current’s traditional symbols in
myth and legend are birds such as the eagle, the hawk, and
the heron. Magical writings sometimes call it _aud_ or _od,_ and
in alchemy it is the Sun. Its primary symbol in Druid lore is
the circle, representing the Sun’s orb. It is symbolically mas-
culine,and one of its names is the _current of knowledge._
The telluric current takes its name from Tellus, an old
name for the Earth.It rises up from the heart of the Earth
through the crust to the surface, and takes its form and char-
acter from the landscape the way the solar current takes its
character from the turning planets. Underground water
affects it powerfully, and springs and wells where water comes
to the surface blaze with it. The serpent and the dragon are
the most common symbols of the telluric current in myth
and legend.Its names in occult lore include _the secret fire, the
dragon current,_ and _aub_ or _ob,_ and in alchemy it is Mercury. Its
primary symbol in Druid lore is the triangle, representing its
fiery and transforming nature. It is symbolically feminine,
and one of its names is the _current of power._
Most systems of ritual magic in the modern West rely on
the solar current exclusively. In writings from these tradi-
tions you’ll hear plenty of talk about heavens and higher lev-

**_26_** Part One: The Foundations of Druid Magic


els of being. Learning magic in these systems takes the form
of ascent from lower to higher levels, and the major rituals
call down the powers of the planets and stars, or draw down
deities into earthly manifestation. All these higher levels and
powers, to the Druid way of thinking, are ways of talking
about different aspects of the solar current.
A much smaller number of magical traditions in the West-
ern world work exclusively with the telluric current instead.
In systems of this sort you’ll hear talk about underworlds and
deeper levels of existence. Learning magic in these systems
takes the form of descent or deepening, and the major rituals
bring up energies from within the Earth or call up spirits from
the depths.All these underworlds and their powers, to the
Druid way of thinking, are ways of talking about different as-
pects of the telluric current.
Traditions that work with the telluric current have a
dubious reputation in modern occult circles, and in a very
few cases this reputation has been well earned. Workings
from certain medieval handbooks of magic use ritual to sum-
mon unbalanced, destructive telluric entities from deep
within the Earth,so that the mage can browbeat them with
symbols of the solar current, bribe them with sacrifices, and
force them to obey his will. This approach is as dangerous as
it sounds,and tends to be self-defeating as well, since the
entities in question usually do whatever they can to turn the
tables on their would-be controller. Some of the imagery in
these systems draws on popular religious ideas about devils,
and this has encouraged some people—even in the occult
community—to think of all telluric magic as devil worship.
This is untrue, and indeed unfair. Most of the occult sys-
tems that focus on the telluric current bless and heal as
effectively and as often as any system of solar magic, and

The Ways of the Life Force **_27_**


have nothing to do with Satan or any other figure out of
Christian mythology. For that matter, there are unbalanced
and destructive magical systems that rely solely on the solar
current.
It’s quite true that the telluric current expresses itself in
the individual through the lower aspects of human nature—
the forces of life, love, passion, and power that root in the
body—but it’s only from the biased viewpoint of an extreme
solar perspective that _lower_ means _worse._ These aspects of the
self are lower in the same way that a foundation is lower than
the building it supports.They evolved long ages ago and func-
tion without conscious attention, and they also work
through centers of nwyfre in the belly, hips, and feet, the
lower half of the physical body.The womb center, in the belly
about one inch below the level of the navel, is the primary
focus of the telluric current in the body.
The solar current, by contrast, expresses itself through
what are often called the higher aspects of human nature—
our capacities for reason, imagination, abstract knowledge,
and impersonal emotion. These aspects of the self are higher
than the manifestations of the telluric current in the most
straightforward physical sense, since they function through
centers of nwyfre in the chest, shoulders, and hands. They
also evolved more recently and thus require more conscious
attention and development than the body and its passions do.
For most of Western history, spiritual as well as magical
traditions have embraced one or the other of these currents,
and rather too often, they have rejected the other one. The
result of this binary has been a great deal of spiritual and psy-
chological imbalance. Taken to extremes, an obsession with
the solar current turns spirituality into an arid pursuit of
abstract perfection that abandons the body and its potentials

**_28_** Part One: The Foundations of Druid Magic


for power and delight. Taken to extremes, an obsession with
the telluric current turns spirituality into a quest for raw
physical sensation that abandons the mind and its potentials
for wisdom and insight.
From a Druid perspective, at least, neither of these ex-
tremes is very useful. Far more effective as a starting point
for magic is the recognition that both poles of the binary are
equally necessary and equally holy. From this comes the real-
ization that the interactions between the currents offer many
more possibilities for creative action than either current does
on its own.
The two currents can interact in several different ways.
On the simplest level,they can balance one another like the
two halves of the famous _t’ai-chi_ (yin-yang) symbol of Tao-
ism (presented as Figure 1-1). At the point of balance be-
tween them,possibilities of freedom and effective action
exist that cannot be reached from either one of the currents
on their own.
The two currents can also set secondary currents of
energy in motion. In the symbolic language of alchemy,
heaven and earth give birth to a red king and a white queen.
These two currents, the red and white dragons of Celtic leg-
end,reflect the energies of the solar and telluric currents in

**Figure 1-1 The T’ai-Chi Symbol**

The Ways of the Life Force **_29_**


the natural world. They play an important role in sexual
polarity, and they also have a place in Druid magical work.
The third relationship between the solar and telluric
currents, however, yields the deepest and most powerful
results. The two currents can fuse, and this fusion gives rise
to a third current: the central secret of Druid magic.

**The Quest for the Grail**
This third current has many names, but the name we’ll use
here is the _lunar current._ Unlike the solar and telluric cur-
rents, the lunar current does not exist naturally in the indi-
vidual or the world.It must be made by the balanced fusion
of the solar and telluric currents. The art of accomplishing
this fusion stands at the heart of Druid magic.
The lunar current is called _aur_ and _o_ r in occult writings.
Its primary symbol in magical lore is the crescent Moon, and
its mythic symbols include the egg, the jewel, the sacred cup,
and the child. It mediates between solar and telluric currents
in the same way that the Moon mediates between Sun and
Earth.It functions on a higher level than the solar current,
since it is still evolving in human beings and must be created
consciously, and since its energy centers are located in the
head,above the centers of the solar and telluric current. Its
primary focus in the body is the pineal center in the middle
of the head, behind the base of the nose.
While the telluric current works through the body and
its passions, and the solar current acts through the mind and
its perceptions,the lunar current expresses itself through
the soul and its powers. When the lunar current awakens in
an individual, it awakens the inner senses and unfolds into
enlightenment.When it awakens in the land, it brings heal-
ing, fertility, and plenty.

**_30_** Part One: The Foundations of Druid Magic


These three currents play an important if rarely recog-
nized role in one of the world’s most magical legends, the
strange medieval tale about a maimed king, a land under a
curse, and a mysterious cup called the Grail. Like Max Weber’s
account of the effects of industrial society on the human
spirit, the Grail legend is a story of disenchantment. The
Grail was a wondrous cup with the power to bring fertility
and plenty to the land, but because of an ancient crime—dif-
ferent versions of the Grail legend disagreed about what the
crime had been—its guardian, the maimed Fisher King,
could no longer use its power, and his kingdom became the
desolate Waste Land. Only if a questing knight reached the
Grail Castle,beheld the Grail,and asked the right question
could the magic of the Grail be restored and the Waste Land
flourish anew.
While the legend of the Grail is written in the language
of medieval romance and draws on the older and even more
challenging language of ancient myth, it tells the same story
that Weber put in the more precise but less appealing lan-
guage of sociology. The original Grail legends first emerged
at the same time as the intellectual currents that,centuries
later, drove the birth of industrial society and its materialist
worldview. When Weber wrote his book, industrial society
seemed to have overcome all opposition, yet he and many
other people recognized the appalling human cost of that tri-
umph, and the Grail legend itself—revived by nineteenth-
century poets and artists as part of their own rebellion against
industrial society—had become one of the major cultural
icons of the age, a symbol that summed up for many people
everything that had been lost in the disenchantment of the
world.
The Grail legend has even more relevance today, at a
time when environmental crisis and industrialism run amok

promise to turn huge swaths of the living Earth into a Waste
Land more desolate than anything the storytellers of the
Middle Ages could have imagined. Questing, knightly
courage, and the art of asking the right questions still has a
central role in the task of finding the Grail today, but the mag-
ical workings presented in this book can become another way
toseek the Grail and reenchant a disenchanted world.
Ahint pointing to how this works can be found in the
way the traditional symbols of the three currents combine.
As mentioned earlier in this chapter, an important magical
symbol of the telluric current or secret fire is a triangle with
one point upward; a disk like the Sun stands for the solar
current, and a crescent Moon for the lunar current. Put the
three shapes together, in the order they appear in the human
body, and the result is a familiar image (Figure 1-2). How
these three forces are used to create the Grail is the subject
of this book.

## Chapter 2 The Alphabet of Magic

Every system of magic has its own ways of working with
nwyfre. The art of natural magic, for example, relies on
material substances that set up particular patterns in nwyfre.
These substances go into amulets,oils,and the like,and they
create the desired pattern in nwyfre wherever they are.
European peasants thus used to gather the bright yellow
flowers of the herb St. John’s wort at midsummer and put
them over doors and windows to protect against hostile
magic, because this herb attracts the solar current and radi-
ates a potent protective quality.
Turn to the art of astrological magic and you encounter
a completely different way of working with nwyfre. This
branch ofmagic was invented in ancient Babylon and was
passed down through the centuries by Greek, Roman, Arab,
and medieval European mages to the Renaissance, when it
became the most influential magical system of the age; it is
almost extinct now, though a few dedicated scholars still
practice it. The astrological mage studies the movements of
planets and stars to gauge their relative influences on the
solar current. At the moment when some desired quality is
at its peak, the mage crafts and consecrates a talisman to
catch and store nwyfre full of that quality, and the talisman
radiates the pattern placed in it from that moment on.


Either of these two magical systems can be followed as
part of a modern Druid path, as indeed can most other mag-
ical systems. During the years when magic found its way back
into Druidry, however, the most common approach to magic
all through the Western world was the art of ritual magic.
Developed out of medieval and Renaissance sources by the
great French mage Eliphas Lévi in the middle years of the
nineteenth century, ritual magic relies on the human imagi-
nation to work with nwyfre. As the most widely known and
accessible magical system during the revival of Druid magic,
ritual magic became the template most twentieth-century
Druids used to weave their own magical systems, and it
defines the approach used in this book.
In his classic books on magic, Lévi presented a vision of
the universe very close to the Druid philosophy outlined in
chapter 1.To Lévi,the astral light—his name for the life
force—is the “great magical agent,” the power that mages
wield to accomplish their work.What we call the imagina-
tion, Lévi terms the _diaphane,_ the subtle body through which
the human mind can sense and shape the astral light. Thus
dreams and daydreams,stray thoughts,and all the other
products of imagination are not simply inside one human
brain; some are created by the diaphane of the person who
experiences them, others come from outside, but all are pro-
jected onto the astral light.When this is done with intention
and concentration, it sets up patterns and flows in the astral
light, and these accomplish magical effects.
These same ideas form the core of the system of magic
presented in this book.What Lévi called the astral light,
Druid mages call nwyfre; what he called the diaphane,Welsh
Druid tradition calls the _enaid_ (pronounced “ENN-eyed”), the
body of nwyfre. When a pattern is projected into the enaid

**_34_** Part One: The Foundations of Druid Magic


with intention and concentration, a Druid mage might say,
that pattern takes shape in the nwyfre and sends ripples out-
ward. If that pattern is filled with one or more of the great
currents of nwyfre—the solar, telluric, or lunar currents—
the ripples that go outward from it have immense power and
can shape the world in dramatic ways.

**Magical Symbolism**
Powerful as it is, this process can be worked very simply.The
art of creative visualization, one of the most common prac-
tices in today’s alternative spirituality scene, is a good exam-
ple.To practice creative visualization, you simply imagine a
situation that you want to bring into your life and make the
mental image as rich, detailed, and precise as you can. As you
hold the image in your awareness,focus on the idea that by
visualizing it, you are bringing that situation into reality.
Much more often than not, people who put this method to
work find that the desired situation occurs in their lives,
often copying their visualization in precise detail.
Many traditional occult schools teach creative visualiza-
tion to beginning students as a good introduction to the way
magic works. In a society that dismisses magic as so much
fraud and delusion, the chance to experience it as a living and
powerful reality is an important step in magical training, and
creative visualization provides that. As a practical technique,
though, it suffers from major limitations: most of the time, it
takes a great deal of work with the technique to get results
from it, and the more emotional investment you have in the
situation, the less likely you are to get any results at all.
These limitations unfold from the principle of inten-
tionality. As explained earlier, the intentionality you choose

The Alphabet of Magic **_35_**


shapes your experience by setting patterns of nwyfre into
motion. The more intensely you can concentrate on your
intentionality, the stronger the effect will be. It’s easier to con-
centrate on a simple image than a complex set of ideas. In cre-
ative visualization, however, a mental picture simple enough
to allow intense concentration will usually be too simple to
express your intention clearly, and one detailed enough to for-
mulate your intention will usually be too complex to allow
intense focus.
Emotional investment amplifies this effect. Most people
who try creative visualization to improve their health, say, are
motivated by desire and fear—they crave health or fear sick-
ness,or both. Few people have the mental discipline to visu-
alize a scene that touches on desires or fears without stirring
up those emotions, and the attention that goes into desiring
health or fearing sickness is diverted from the magical work
at hand.Worse, since desire and fear both focus on _not_ being
healthy—the desire fixates on what you would do if your
health improves, the fear on what might happen if it does
not—you risk setting up an intentionality of wanting to be
healthy,rather than one of being healthy,and ending up with
the opposite of the effect you want.
The solution to these problems is as old as magic itself.
Instead of concentrating on a mental picture of the situation
you want to create, you concentrate on an abstract symbol
that represents that situation without actually portraying it.
You start by stating aloud what you want to bring into being,
and then release the words and concentrate entirely on the
symbol.Since magical symbols are visually simple,concen-
trating on them is easier, and since they have no obvious con-
nection to the goal of the work, most novice mages find it
much easier to keep unwanted emotions and wandering
thoughts from intruding and weakening the process.

**_36_** Part One: The Foundations of Druid Magic


Some modern magical systems like to create a unique
symbolism for each working.This can work well enough, but
most mages find that symbols used repeatedly get stronger
results than symbols made up for individual workings. The
traditional explanation for this experience is that symbols
develop something like momentum in the way they affect
nwyfre. The more often a symbol is projected into nwyfre,
in other words, the more quickly and powerfully nwyfre re-
sponds to it.
This way of thinking about symbols helps avoid two less
useful attitudes toward them that are common nowadays.
Some people dismiss symbols as a hodgepodge of arbitrary
images connected in arbitrary ways. Others go to the oppo-
site extreme and decide that some particular set of symbols
express hard and fast truths about the universe—that the
element of water is associated with the west and the color
blue, let’s say, as a matter of objective fact. Neither of these
viewpoints fit the way symbols actually function in magic.
Traditional symbols and symbolic relationships work well
when put to the only test that counts—the test of actual
practice—but different systems disagree on how symbols re-
late to one another. In Chinese Taoist magic, for example,
the element of water is associated with the North and the
color black, rather than West and blue, but Taoist mages get
results just as effectively as Druid mages do.
The key to understanding this is the recognition that all
symbols draw their meaning from their context in a whole
system.The relationship between west and water, to con-
tinue the example, comes out of a particular way of thinking
about elements, directions, and much else. To say that the
west corresponds to water is to say that within a particular
system the west, among the directions, means many of the
same things that water means among the elements.

The Alphabet of Magic **_37_**


Another way to say the same thing is to suggest that the
logic of magical symbolism is closely related to the logic of
poetry. In a well-written poem, each turn of phrase and
choice of imagery takes its meaning from its context. When
the Scottish poet Robert Burns began a poem with the line
“My love is like a red, red rose,” he didn’t mean to suggest that
the woman he loved had thorns, or was green from the hair-
line down, or resembled a rose in any of a hundred other ways.
He meant that she was beautiful; more than that, he meant to
remind the reader of the way the brilliant red of a rose against
the drab greens and browns of the rosebush catches and holds
the eye, and used this as an image of the intensity of a lover’s
gaze focusing on the one he loves. The context of the poem
gives the correspondence between woman and rose its
meaning.
Some poems use only stock images and phrases that al-
ready have a rich context of meaning. Others use images and
phrases nobody else has used before.Very often, though, the
best poetry combines the familiar and the new in creative
ways. Magical symbolism most often works the same way as
this third type.There’s a good deal of common ground among
different systems, but if you compare magical handbooks
from the Middle Ages, say, you’ll discover that no two of
them use exactly the same symbolism. Since no two of the
old grimoires work magic in the same way, or for the same
purposes, this sort of diversity is unavoidable.
To return to the metaphor of poetry, if _your_ love isn’t like
a red, red rose, but looks like some other flower, then by all
means use the words that work for you.As you go through
this book, in other words, feel free to experiment with sym-
bols other than the ones I provide.The disadvantage of using
a symbolism that does not work for you can easily outweigh

**_38_** Part One: The Foundations of Druid Magic


the advantage of momentum from using a symbol other peo-
ple also use. Magic is a creative art, and the personal factor
needs to be included in any working.

**The Ogham Alphabet**
The modern Druid tradition, like most other forms of spiritu-
ality, has a wealth of symbols that can be put to work in magic.
The three elements and three currents discussed in chapter 1
can be understood and used as symbols, though they also rep-
resent real forces that shape the world of our experience.
From the beginning of the Druid Revival, though, one partic-
ular set of symbols has had a central role in Druid practice.
This is the old Irish alphabet called _Ogham_ (pronounced
“OH-um”),one of the world’s most eccentric writing systems.
Ogham letters are called “fews” ( _feada_ in Irish) and consist of
four groups called _aicme,_ of one to five tally marks each.
There are also five more complex signs,called _forfedha_ (lit-
erally “extra fews”), used for sounds that weren’t part of the
original alphabet. The fews are marked along a line—up-
ward from the bottom on a vertical line, and from left to
right on a horizontal one, as shown in Figure 2-1. Awkward
on paper,Ogham is quick,clean,and very readable if your
writing instrument is a knife and your “paper” is a stick, and
even better if you’re using a chisel on the edges of a standing
stone. All over Ireland, Scotland, and the western parts of
Britain standing stones carved with Ogham between the third
and tenth centuries CE can still be read today.
The ancient Irish and the Picts—the people who lived in
Scotland before the Scots got there—used Ogham fews to
write names on gravestones and spells on magical objects.
Bythe tenth century, Ogham had been replaced by the

The Alphabet of Magic **_39_**


**Figure 2-1 Ogham Writing**

Roman alphabet in general use, but Irish bardic schools kept
it alive as a branch of traditional lore for centuries longer,
and wove a wealth of symbolism into it. The surviving Irish
Ogham treatises connect the fews to trees, colors, and much
else, giving them a wealth of possibilities as magical symbols.
As a relic of ancient Celtic tradition the Ogham found its
way into modern Druidry from the very beginning. John
Toland, who helped launch the Druid Revival in the early
eighteenth century, included references to Ogham in his
writings, and many other Druid writers in the eighteenth
and nineteenth centuries discuss Ogham as a Druid alpha-
bet. By the time Druids began developing the magical side of
their tradition in the twentieth century, Ogham provided
them with an alphabet of symbols as rich as anything in the
Western world’s other magical traditions.
The twenty-five Ogham fews, along with some of their
meanings, appear on the next few pages. More of their sym-
bolism occurs later in this book, and a more complete list of
their meanings can be found in _The Druidry Handbook._ These
letters are as important to Druid magic as the letters of
English are to reading this book, and the time you spend
learning them will not be wasted.

**Ogham and the Elements**
Unless you have studied other magical systems, you may be
wondering how these Ogham fews relate to magic at all.The
secret lies in the magical practice of _correspondence._ A corre-
spondence is a relationship between two symbols,connecting
them with exactly the same sort of poetic logic mentioned
earlier in this chapter. These connections give you the raw
materials to turn any situation you want to bring about into
a symbol you can imagine clearly.They also weave the world
together into patterns of shared meaning—the basis for the
enchantment of the world.
Each Ogham few has many correspondences, some
more useful in magic than others. Among the most useful are
the five traditional elements.A quirk of language makes these
elements challenging for many modern people to under-
stand, however. Today’s science sees elements as basic types
of physical matter,each made up of a distinct kind of atom.
Hydrogen, for example, is made of atoms with one proton
and one electron; helium, of atoms with two protons and
two electrons, and so on. This is the only meaning of the
word _element_ most people know nowadays.
The word originally meant something different, however.
Before it was taken over and redefined by chemists in the
eighteenth century,elements were understood as conditions
of matter, not fixed types, and there were five of them:

The Alphabet of Magic **_45_**


earth, water, air, fire, and spirit. Modern scientists heap
scorn on this older system, and then go on to describe a uni-
verse made of solids, liquids, gases, energy, and the back-
ground fabric of spacetime itself—exactly the same concept
under different names.
Yet the traditional elements are not simply physical states
of matter. Like everything in the old enchanted world, they
had connections linking them to everything else in the uni-
verse of human experience. Each of the elements corre-
sponds to a season, a direction, a time of day, an emotional
state, and much more. Even today, we describe someone
prone to anger as hot tempered, someone whose thoughts
drift loose from reality as an airhead, and so on. All these
metaphors point to symbolic connections that magic can use.

**Table 2-1 The Five Elements**

**Element** Air Fire Water Earth Spirit
**Direction** East South West North Center
**Color** Yellow Red Blue Green White
**Time of Day** Dawn Noon Dusk Midnight Now

**Symbol**

The five elements have these basic qualities:
_Air_ opens, expands, clarifies, and connects.The old elemen-
tal lore calls it warm and moist—that is, it radiates energy and
responds to its surroundings. It corresponds to the east, dawn,
spring among the seasons, and the intellect in the self.
_Fire_ illuminates,challenges,transforms,and destroys. Ele-
mental lore calls it warm and dry—that is, it radiates energy
and does not respond to its surroundings. It corresponds to

**_46_** Part One: The Foundations of Druid Magic


the south, noon, summer among the seasons, and the will in
the self.
_Water_ receives, resolves, unites, and dissolves.The old ele-
mental lore calls it cold and moist—that is, it absorbs energy
and responds to its surroundings. It corresponds to the west,
dusk, autumn among the seasons, and the emotions in the self.
_Earth_ closes, limits, establishes, and manifests. The old
elemental lore calls it cold and dry—that is, it absorbs energy
and does not respond to its surroundings. It corresponds to
the north, midnight, winter among the seasons, and the
senses in the self.
_Spirit_ originates, witnesses, and reabsorbs all the other
elements.The old elemental lore gives it no qualities of its
own, because all qualities unfold from it. It corresponds to the
center, the present moment, and pure awareness in the self.
In certain Druid traditions—including that of AODA,
the source of the magical system taught in this book—the
element of spirit is further divided into three elements:
Spirit Above, Spirit Below, and Spirit Within, corresponding
to nwyfre, gwyar, and calas. This fits an old symbolism that
assigns the number 3 to spirit,the number 4 to matter,and
the number 7 to the universe, which is made of both. Several
important parts of the ritual work in this book use this sys-
tem of seven elements.
The symbolism of the Ogham uses the more basic set of
five elements. It adds another level of complexity, however,
because each few represents a combination of two elements,
not a single element on its own.Each of the five elements
can be divided into five subelements; air, for example, has a
spiritual side, a fiery side, an airy side, a watery side, and an
earthy side, and so on for all the other elements.

The Alphabet of Magic **_47_**


**_48_** Part One: The Foundations of Druid Magic

Table 2-2 shows how this works. Each aicme of five fews
represents one of the five elements, and each few in the
aicme is a subelement of that element.Thus Beith is the spir-
itual side of the element of air, Luis the fiery side of air, Nuin
its airy side, Fearn its watery side, and so on through the list
of fews to Mór, the earthy side of spirit. In this way the
Ogham alphabet gives the Druid mage access to a precise set
of symbols for elemental forces.

**Table 2-2 Ogham and the Elements**

It’s important to take the time to think through these corre-
spondences, and see how each few combines the elemental
forces that go into it. Later on, we’ll discuss other prac-
tices—meditation and scrying—that will help you explore
these correspondences and others in more depth, in prepa-
ration for using them in magic. The simple process of think-
ing about them and trying to see how the meaning of the few
unfolds from the combination of the elements, however,
offers a good starting place for this work.

**Ogham and the Two Currents**
The elements are only part of the full symbolism of the
Ogham alphabet, however. Another part can best be ap-
proached through the work of two of the twentieth century’s
most influential writers on Ogham. The first of them,
Robert Graves, was neither a Druid nor an occultist. He was
a poet and writer, one of the “War Poets” whose work voiced
the bitterness of the generation that survived the trenches of
the First World War, and a passionate if somewhat eccentric
student of mythology.
In 1944,as Graves waited out the Second World War in a
small village in Devonshire and worked on a novel about the
Argonauts, he found his mind haunted by the Ogham and its
relationship to mythology. Setting the novel aside, he launched
into a book on Ogham and myth called _The Roebuck in the
Thicket,_ finishing a 70,000-word manuscript on the subject in
three weeks.After the war ended,he returned to his home in
Majorca and turned the manuscript into the book that intro-
duced Ogham to the Neopagan scene: _The White Goddess._
Graves and his mythic interpretation of Ogham have come
in for more than their share of controversy in recent years.
Some people in the Pagan community accepted Graves’ theo-
ries as historical fact. Others reacted against this by dismiss-
ing Graves as a purveyor of hokum. Both missed the point
that Graves was a poet, not a historian, and _The White Goddess_
is an intensely personal poetic vision of mythology, not a
history textbook.
As a brilliantly constructed work of poetic symbolism and
myth, _The White Goddess_ makes very poor history but excellent
poetry—and as suggested earlier in this chapter, what makes
good poetry also makes good magic. This insight guided the
second of our two Ogham authors, Colin Murray, in making
sense of Ogham as a Druid magical alphabet for today.

The Alphabet of Magic **_49_**


Murray, an architect and antiquarian with a passion for
Celtic studies, was a major presence in the British Druid
scene in the second half of the twentieth century. The Druid
order he founded, the Golden Section Order (GSO), always
remained small but had a massive influence on other Druid
groups all over the world. Among his other achievements, he
created the first Ogham divination system in modern times,
and nearly all books on Ogham printed since the 1970s bor-
row from his work.
One of the chief things Murray drew from Graves was a
way of arranging the twenty primary Ogham letters in a _dol-
men arch,_ as shown in Figure 2-2.
Graves created this diagram to explain one of the features
of his Ogham system,a lunar calendar with thirteen months
named after thirteen of the Ogham consonants. The months
begin at the winter solstice with the letter _Beith,_ markedhere
as _B,_ on the bottom of the left-hand pillar, and rise up to
_Saille,_ marked as _S,_ on the lintel stone above. _Straif,_ shown as
_Z,_ shares Saille’s month, which is why it appears on the end
of the lintel stone next to _S._ The months then proceed from
left to right from Saille through Huath,Duir,and Tinne to
Coll and Quert, which share a month. The calendar turns
down the right-hand pillar at C, and descends through Muin,

Gort, and Ngetal to Ruis at the bottom. The five vowels
_Ailm, Onn, Ur, Eadha,_ and _Ioho_ mark the ground below the
arch, because they represent specific days—the solstices and
equinoxes—rather than months.
Murray noted that the figure puts Duir the oak-few at
the top center and Ur the heather-few at the bottom center.
The oak, because it attracts lightning and is sacred to sky
gods in many cultures, has long been a symbol of the power
of the heavens. The heather, because of its magical powers
and its place as an ingredient in heather ale, a magnificently
intoxicating beverage, has long been a symbol of the power
of the Earth. The meanings of the two Ogham letters link
them to two forms of an ancient magical symbol—the pen-
tagram (Figure 2-3).
A _pentagram_ is a star made of five equal lines meeting at
five equal angles.Since the time of Pythagoras,who brought
sacred geometry to the Western world in the sixth century
BCE, it has been one of the core symbols of Western magic
and spirituality. It has had many meanings down through the
years. Modern Pagans who think of it as a purely Pagan
symbol,for instance,may be startled to find it in the me-
dieval poem _Sir Gawain and the Green Knight_ as an emblem of
Christian virtues!

**Figure 2-3 The Pentagram**

The Alphabet of Magic **_51_**

```
“Upright”
(Oak)
```
```
“Reversed”
(Heather)
```

In modern magical practice, it stands for the power of
the element of spirit in relation to the four material elements.
A moral dimension goes along with this interpretation in
most magical writings: a pentagram with a single point up-
ward is considered “upright” and stands for spirit ruling over
the four elements, while a pentagram with a single point
downward is called “reversed” and stands for spirit submerged
beneath the four elements.The upright pentagram thus serves
as a symbol of good,and the reversed pentagram an emblem
of evil.
All this, however, depends on the assumption that spirit
is always and only above—in the terms introduced in chap-
ter 2,that the solar current is good and the telluric current
is evil.That assumption is very common in modern occultism,
but it’s no less wrong for being popular. Recognize the tel-
luric current as a power just as holy and necessary as the
solar current, and the relationship between the pentagrams
takes on a newand more balanced meaning.
Murray applied this insight to Graves’ Ogham diagram
and turned it into a potent tool for Druid magic. Map the
pentagrams onto the dolmen arch,and the Ogham fews give
new names to each form. The upright or solar pentagram
touches Duir with its uppermost point, so in Druid practice
this formis called the “oak pentagram” (Figure 2-4). The

reversed or telluric pentagram touches Ur with its lower-
most point and is therefore called the “heather pentagram”
(Figure 2-5). As symbols of the solar and telluric currents
respectively, the oak and heather pentagrams allow you to
work with the two currents in ritual.

**Ogham and the Wheel of the Year**
Graves’ thirteen-month Ogham calendar has seen some use
in modern Druidry, but long before Graves came along,
Druidry had its own sacred calendar. From the beginnings of
the Druid Revival, the tradition of watching the summer
solstice at Stonehenge provided the anchor point for that cal-
endar, and by the late eighteenth century the winter solstice
and the equinoxes had been added to create a fourfold cere-
monial calendar that followed the dance of Sun and Earth.
This calendar remained standard in the Druid community
until the early 1950s, when Ross Nichols and his fellow Druid
Gerald Gardner, the founder of modern Wicca, took it a step
further. Gardner found references in Irish and Scottish
sources to an old sacred calendar with four festivals—
_Samhuinn,Imbolc, Belteinne,_ and _Lughnasadh,_ to give them their
usual Druid names—midway between the solstices and equi-
noxes, and he used this fourfold calendar in the first version

of his newly created nature religion, then called “Wica.” Both
men were members of the Druid Circle of the Universal
Bond, one of the largest Druid orders of the time, and they
knew the standard Druid calendar well. Their inspiration
was to fuse the two into an eightfold calendar (Figure 2-6).
According to a tradition current in English Druid circles to-
day, the inspiration for the eightfold wheel of the year hap-
pened in a London pub after several pints of ale; if this is
true, it was not the only important event in Druid history to
take place in a pub!
The new calendar caught on rapidly, and today most Pa-
gans throughout the Western world use the eightfold wheel of
the year. Many of them believe that this calendar dates back to
ancient times.In point of fact, no trace of a ritual calendar
based on these eight festivals, and only these festivals, appears
anywhere before Gardner and Murray publicized their ver-
sion, and the eightfold calendar has accordingly come in for
the same sort of criticism as Graves’Ogham system.Once
again, though, such criticism misses the point. A ritual calen-
dar, like a magical alphabet, has value because it works, not
because it has (or lacks) a particular historical pedigree.
Nichols and Gardner were both expert occultists, and
they created something much more potent than a simple cal-
endar. Understood in depth, the wheel of the year models
every process in the universe of human experience as a cycle
of eight stations (see Table 2-3), driven by two balanced forces
moving around a third, central pivot. The eight festivals can
be seen as eight archetypal realms of being, like the spheres
of the Cabalistic Tree of Life used in the Golden Dawn and
many other magical traditions. Connect these Stations with
the twenty-five fews of the Ogham alphabet, and the result

**_54_** Part One: The Foundations of Druid Magic


is the Wheel of Life, one of the core conceptual tools of
Druid magic (Figure 2-7).
Like the Cabalistic Tree of Life, the Wheel of Life defines
a set of magical states of consciousness and realms of experi-
ence and provides pathways to move from one to another.

Both the Wheel and the Tree have thirty-three elements: 10
Spheres plus 22 Paths plus a transitional realm called _Daath_
or Knowledge make up the Tree of Life; 8 Stations plus 24
Paths plus the Central Grove make up the Wheel of Life.
(Figure 2-8 shows how the two diagrams compare.) From a
deeper perspective,the two diagrams are alternative ways of
looking at the same set of relationships, and meditating on
the relationship between them opens the door to many mys-
teries.
The Tree and the Wheel are not identical in structure or
operation, though, and several crucial differences divide them.
One is that the Tree is based on a map of space, while the
Wheel is a map of time. The spheres of the Tree are assigned
to parts of the Earth-centered cosmos of the Middle Ages—
the bottom sphere is the Earth, the seven above it are the

seven planets known before the discovery of the telescope,
the ninth is the realm of the stars, and the tenth represents
the divine realm beyond the stars.
TheWheel, by contrast, follows the cycle of the sea-
sons. Instead of seeing the great realms of existence as worlds
far from our own, it pictures them as phases of time that
manifest right here on Earth in cyclic patterns. These same
patterns appear in smaller cycles of time—for example, the
old Welsh Druid lore divides the day into eight parts, corre-
sponding to the Stations of the Wheel,and the lunar cycle can
also be divided into eight parts. All these can be used to time
magical workings, and each Station is at its strongest when its
daily, monthly, and yearly times occur together. The corre-
spondences among these phases are shown in Table 2-4.

Another major difference between the Tree of Life and
the Wheel of Life lies in the way the process of magical initi-
ation appears on them.The Tree shows magical initiation as
an upward journey from the lowest sphere of ordinary con-
sciousness, called _Malkuth_ in the Cabala, to the highest sphere
of universal consciousness,called _Kether._ The Wheel,by con-
trast, shows magical initiation as a continuing cycle around a
point of balance—the Central Grove—from which all states
of consciousness can be accessed at once.
This echoes some of the core concepts of the Druid tradi-
tion. From the standpoint of Druidry, after all, the material
world is just as holy as any other, and spiritual practice is not
a matter of abandoning one state of being for another, sup-
posedly higher one, but rather of embracing the full poten-
tial of what it means to be human and learning to be present
in whatever mode of being is most relevant at any given
moment.The vision of the process of initiation as a circle
also teaches what every magical initiate knows, that the way
of initiation has to be walked many times, not just once.
The difference between the two diagrams, finally, has im-
portant practical applications in magical work. The Tree of
Life orients the mage toward a single source of spiritual po-

**_58_** Part One: The Foundations of Druid Magic


wer, the universal consciousness of Kether, but the Wheel of
Life places the mage in a relationship with two sources, the
solar current above and the telluric current below. In one
sense, those are represented by two Stations: Alban Heruin,
the summer solstice, represents the solar current, while
Alban Arthuan, the winter solstice, represents the telluric
current. This is a simplified model, though. On another level,
the solar and telluric currents manifest through each of the
Stations,and what moves the currents from Station to Sta-
tion is the factor of time.
Imagine for a moment that you are standing in the
Central Grove with half the Wheel rising high above you and
the other half sinking far below. Above you is Alban Arthuan,
as in Figure 2-6, and below you is Alban Heruin. During the
season of Alban Arthuan, the six weeks or so following the
winter solstice,this is an accurate map of the currents:the
solar current flows through the Station of Alban Arthuan,
while the telluric current flows through the Station of Alban
Heruin.
Six weeks pass, the Wheel of Life turns an eighth of the
way around its cycle,and Imbolc arrives.Imbolc is now over-
head, Lughnasadh is below, and these two Stations mediate the
solar and telluric currents respectively. Six more weeks pass,
and Alban Eiler directs the solar current while Alban Elued
channels the telluric current. In the course of the year, both
currents flow through each of the eight Stations in turn.
This is the magical meaning of the eight festivals of the
modern Druid year.Each festival represents the point at
which the solar and telluric currents shift to new Stations on
the Wheel. The Station occupied by the solar current is the
festival being celebrated, while the telluric current flows
through the Station at the opposite point of the Wheel.

The Alphabet of Magic **_59_**


Celtic folklore hints at this double cycle in stories about
another world, the world of the faeries or the dead, where
the seasons are exactly opposite to ours. This “other world”
lies beneath the surface of the Earth, in the realm of the tel-
luric current, and the cycle of its nwyfre through the eight
Stations forms one of the secrets of Druid magic.
The key to this secret lies in the pentagram.You learned
earlier in this chapter that the oak and heather pentagrams
allowyou to summon nwyfre from the solar and telluric
currents. This is the most important use of the pentagrams,
but it conceals a more complex and flexible use. The upper
point of the oak pentagram, and the lower point of the
heather pentagram, represent the solar and telluric currents
_and whatever Station they occupy at the time the pentagram is
drawn._ The other points of both pentagrams, in turn, repre-
sent the other Stations of the Wheel,as shown in Figure 2-9.

**Figure 2-9 Pentagrams on the Wheel of Life**


The three Stations in the solar realm—represented by
the upper half of the wheel—are always summoned and ban-
ished with the oak pentagram, and the three in the telluric
realm—the lower half of the wheel—are summoned and
banished with the heather pentagram. The two Stations that
stand on the boundary between the solar and telluric realms
can be summoned or banished with either one. It’s best, how-
ever, to use the oak pentagram for the Station on the right-
hand side,because this one is rising into the solar realm, and
to use the heather pentagram for the Station on the left-hand
side, because this one is setting into the telluric realm.
The point that has to be grasped in all this is that the point
you use for any given Station depends on the season of the
year. Six weeks after Alban Arthuan, when Imbolc arrives, the
Stations shift to the positions shown in Figure 2-10. Six
weeks or so later,when Alban Eiler arrives, they shift again,

and so on around the wheel of the year. This has to be
remembered in order to summon and banish the nwyfre of
the Stations effectively.
In order to reach the point where you can shape nwyfre
effectively through any of these symbols—the elements,
pentagrams, Stations of the Wheel, or Ogham letters—you
need to make the transition from theory to practice. This
transition begins with basic magical exercises, the subject of
the next chapter.

## Chapter 3 The Essentials of Practice

One of the great obstacles to success in magic is also, para-
doxically enough, one of the easiest to overcome. It unfolds
from the common belief that the way to learn magic is to get
hold of secret teachings most people don’t have, either by
opening the right book or finding the right teacher. This be-
lief helps to sell books and boost the egos—and, often, the
income—of teachers willing to cater to it, but it has nothing
to do with the realities of learning magic.The secrets of magic
have been public for centuries now, and yet the number of
competent mages in the world has not gone up noticeably
during that time.
Knowing secret teachings, in point of fact, will not make
you a mage. The real secrets of magic are the same factors
that bring success in any other human activity.This point has
led more than one mage to argue that all human activities,
without exception, are varieties of magic.
Imagine for a moment that instead of wanting to be a
mage, you want to become a guitar player. You would not
expect to reach that goal by announcing to your friends that
you have become a guitar player, dressing like your favorite


lead guitarist, reading plenty of books about guitar playing,
buying guitars and leaving them around your home for visi-
tors to admire, or attending concerts and listening to other
people perform a few times a year. It never fails to amaze seri-
ous occultists how many people expect to become mages by
doing the equivalent!
If you plan on becoming a guitarist, rather than just pre-
tending to be one, three steps will get you from the desire to
the reality. First, you need to decide what kind of music you
want to play, and learn about its history and traditions, while
picking up a good general knowledge of music theory.
Second, you need to get a guitar and practice playing it every
day, seven days a week, fifty-two weeks a year. Third, you
need to learn from your practice, and to compare what you
can do with what you want to do, not so you can puff up
your ego or wallowinhowbad you think you’re failing, but
so you can see what needs work and measure how your
learning process is coming along.
These same three factors—knowledge, practice, and the
ability to learn—are also the keys to magic. If you study
magic,practice magic,and learn from your magical experi-
ences, you’ll become a competent mage. It really is as sim-
ple as that.
The art of ritual magic contains many different forms of
practice, but three of them form the foundation for your
training and development.The first is ritual itself, the second
is divination, and the third is meditation. Think of them as
the three legs that support the cauldron of Druid magic.The
sooner you begin practicing these things,and weave them
into your daily routine, the sooner the doors of Druid magic
will open for you.

**_64_** Part One: The Foundations of Druid Magic


**Ritual**
**_The Sphere of Protection_**
In most traditional magical orders, the first step on the path
of magical training consists of learning a simple ritual and
practicing it regularly. To this day, new members of the
Ancient Order of Druids in America (AODA) are taught such
a ritual in the course of the Candidate grade, the very first
initiation AODA offers. The same ritual, the Sphere of
Protection, forms the foundation of ritual work in the system
taught in this book and is central to the next two chapters.
The Sphere of Protection was created in the 1970s by Dr.
John Gilbert, then one of the Order’s archdruids, using mate-
rial drawn from several older rituals. The version given here
differs from his,and the version you will practice will most
likely be different from the one written in this book. The rea-
sons for this provide a useful lesson in how Druidry works.
Most magical systems require the student to use some
fixed set of gods, symbols, and ideas. Because freedom of
conscience is a core value in Druidry, however, Druid magic
both encourages and requires a more personal approach.The
Sphere of Protection accordingly uses whatever symbolism
you find most evocative and powerful. The other side of this
flexibility,of course, is that the instructions for this ritual
can’t beused like a recipe out of a cookbook.You need to put
a certain amount of preparation and forethought in the
Sphere of Protection before you can use it at all.
This will take time, and at least two other factors have the
same effect. The first is that you need to commit the ritual to
memory. This is a step that novices often try to avoid, but it
has to be tackled, and the sooner the better. It just isn’t possi-
ble to get the most out of magic while you’re still fumbling

The Essentials of Practice **_65_**


with a book or a paper “cheat sheet,” trying to figure out what
comes next. Only after a ritual has been learned by heart, and
practiced regularly until every stage of the work flows easily,
does it become an effective tool in magic.
The other ingredient you need to put into the Sphere of
Protection, and the other factor that takes time, is daily prac-
tice. This is another step that novices usually resist, but it’s
even more important than memorization. Think of it in the
same terms as learning to play a guitar. No matter how much
you read about guitar playing or how often you listen to
other people’s music on your CD player, if you want to learn
how to play, you have to pick up the guitar and practice. It’s
easy to tell the difference between a guitarist who practices
for an hour or so every day, and one who plays only when he
feels like it, or when his friends come over to jam. Magic is
exactly the same way, and mastering it takes time, effort,
passion, and patience. If you only practice it now and then,
don’t expect to get past the garage-band level any time soon.
The Sphere has three phases: an opening, a closing, and
a middle section in which the core work is done. The open-
ing is called the Elemental Cross,the middle section is the
Calling of the Elements, and the closing is the Circulation of
Light. It’s standard practice to learn the opening and closing
first, and practice these together until the student can use
them effectively as a container for the forces roused in the
middle section. For this reason we’ll leave the Calling of the
Elements for later, and cover the Elemental Cross and
Circulation of Light in this chapter.
If you belong to a Druid order that teaches a different
basic ritual, or have learned some other ritual from books,
you can use that in place of the Sphere of Protection.You will
need to modify some of the other ceremonies given in this
book, but every Druid mage invents his or her own workings

**_66_** Part One: The Foundations of Druid Magic


sooner or later. Whatever basic ritual you choose, learn it,
commit it to memory, and practice it daily. If you want to
learn magic, there is no other way.

**_The Elemental Cross_**
Like every complete magical ritual, the Elemental Cross
combines symbolism, gesture, voice, and imagination to for-
mulate an intention. These aspects all take place at the same
time when you performthe ritual. For the sake of clarity,
however, I’ll explain them one at a time, and many students
find it best to work through them step-by-step in order.

**Symbolism**
The symbolic component of the Elemental Cross requires you
to choose four expressions of spiritual power that, among
them,define the universe for you.The traditional way is to
choose two gods, one elder and one younger, and two god-
desses, one elder and one younger. The two gods form a ver-
tical axis, the elder above and the younger below; the two
goddesses form a horizontal axis, the elder to the right and the
younger to the left.You can vary this in whatever way works
for you.
What if you’re not comfortable invoking gods, saints, or
any other personified spiritual power? The Sphere of Pro-
tection is flexible enough to handle impersonal symbols as
well.Whatever symbols define your magical universe can be
used for the Elemental Cross.
For example,when I performthe Sphere of Protection,
I sometimes invoke four of the deities that play an important
role in Druid Revival tradition: Hu the Mighty, the high god
of Welsh Druid tradition; Hesus, the chief of tree spirits,
who sits in the first fork of the sacred oak; Ceridwen, the old
wise goddess of the sacred cauldron; and Niwalen, the young

The Essentials of Practice **_67_**


goddess of springtime greenery. At other times, when an
impersonal approach works better for me, I invoke the sky
above me, the land beneath me, the fire to my right hand and
the water to my left.
A Druid who preferred to work with Irish deities might
choose to invoke the Dagda, Lugh, Danu, and Brigid instead,
while a Christian Druid might choose, from among the saints
specially revered by the old Celtic Church, Saint Peter, Saint
John the Evangelist, Saint Brigid, and Saint Mary Magdalene.
One who prefers to work with animal powers might invoke
the Hawk above, the Bear below, the Stag to the right, and the
Salmon to the left. Druids with other beliefs may choose
whatever divine powers appeal to them.

**Gesture**
The gestural component of the Elemental Cross includes
physical orientation, stance, and hand movement.The physical
orientation is based on the traditional lore of the four direc-
tions, and it varies depending on the intention guiding the rit-
ual. As a daily practice, the Elemental Cross and Circulation of
Light are traditionally done facing east,the direction of sun-
rise, which symbolizes inspiration and illumination. As part of
a ritual working using the Grove Ritual, a ceremony covered
later on in this book, the Elemental Cross and Circulation of
Light are traditionally done facing south, the place of the Sun
at its height. Feel free to experiment with these and other
directions.
The stance is much less complex. Place your feet parallel
to one another,with the length of one of your feet between
them. Divide your weight evenly between your feet, and bend
your knees very slightly, just enough to keep them from lock-
ing.Keep your spine upright but not stiff, as though you were

**_68_** Part One: The Foundations of Druid Magic


suspended from the top of your head. Some stances used in
other magical traditions close off the connections between
your body and the nwyfre of the Earth; this one does just the
opposite, since the Earth contacts are crucial in Druid magic.
The hand movements of this phase of the ritual trace out
two lines, one vertical and one horizontal, crossing at the
solar plexus—a point on your body just below your breast-
bone and above the pit of your stomach. They also focus
attention on two points along the midline of the body, the
solar plexus itself and the center of the forehead—the “third
eye” center used in so many mystical disciplines. Originally
this was done with a gesture like the Christian sign of the
cross,but many people—including some Christians—pre-
fer not to do this. The following movements get the same
results without dragging in connotations that many people
find inappropriate.

1. Stand straight but not stiff, your weight evenly divided
    between both feet and your arms at your sides. Take a
    moment to allow tension to drain out of your body and
    into the ground. Then, in a single smooth movement,
    raise your arms out to your sides and up,turning your
    palms upward. The arms and hands rise until your palms
    join above your head, fingertips pointing straight up.
    Next,drawyour hands downward until your joined
    thumbs press against your forehead, and pause.
2. Bring your joined hands down below the level of your
    heart, fingertips still pointing up, and pause again with
    your joined thumbs pressed against your solar plexus.
    Pause here.
3. The next movement is a bit tricky, so follow closely.
    Leave the left hand exactly where it is, thumb against
    your body, fingertips pointing upward, palm facing to

The Essentials of Practice **_69_**


```
the right. The right hand, however, moves out to the
right, and ends up two feet or more past your right
side, at or just below the level of your solar plexus,
with the palm up and the fingers pointing out to your
right. The right elbow remains bent. Glance to your
right, as though looking along the line traced by the
fingers of your right hand. Pause here.
```
4. Next, leave the right hand where it is and move the left
    hand in a mirroring motion, out to the left, ending two
    feet or so past your left side, at or just below the level
    of your solar plexus, with the palm up and the fingers
    pointing to your left.Your left elbow remains bent.
    Glance to your left, as though looking along the line
    traced by the fingers of your left hand. Pause here.
5. Then, in a single motion, extend both hands further
    out,straightening the arms,and turn your palms to
    face forward. At the end of this motion you are stand-
    ing in the formof a cross,with both arms straight out
    to the sides, palms forward, body straight and bal-
    anced, and your gaze straight ahead. Pause in this posi-
    tion for a time,and then let your arms return gently to
    your sides. This completes the gesture component.

**Voice**
The vocal component of the Elemental Cross combines
breath and speech to formulate the deities or symbols
invoked in the practice. The words used in this phase of the
ritual may be spoken in an ordinary voice, chanted, or sung.
1.As you raise your arms above your head, breathe in
deeply, and continue to breathe in as you draw your
joined hands to your forehead. As you pause with your
hands against your forehead, say the name of the first

**_70_** Part One: The Foundations of Druid Magic


```
of the four powers you’ve chosen to invoke—the
name of the elder god, if you’re using the traditional
approach. If you wish, add one or more titles to the
name. For example, at this point in the ritual, I might
say, “Hu the Mighty, great Druid god,” or I might say,
“By the sky above me.”
```
2. Breathe in again as you lower your hands below your
    heart. As you pause with joined hands, say the name of
    the second power—the younger god, if you’re follow-
    ing the traditional approach—along with any titles you
    find appropriate. For example, at this point in the ri-
    tual, I might say, “Hesus of the Oaks, chief of tree spir-
    its,”or I might say, “By the land beneath me.”
3. Breathe in again as your right hand goes out to your
    right side. As you pause, say the name of the third
    power—the elder goddess,in the traditional approach—
    along with any titles you wish to use. For example, at
    this point I might say, “Ceridwen the Wise, keeper of the
    cauldron,” or “By the fire to my right hand.”
4. Breathe in again as your left hand goes out to your left
    side.As you pause,say the name of the fourth power—
    the younger goddess, in the traditional approach—
    along with any titles you wish to use. For example, at
    this point in the ritual,I might say, “Niwalen of the
    Flowers, child of spring,” or “By the water to my left.”
5. Breathe in again as your arms extend and your palms
    turn forward. As you pause, say a short prayer, invo-
    cation,or blessing appropriate to all four of the pow-
    ers you have invoked. For example, at this point in the
    ritual, I say, “May the powers of nature bless and pro-
    tect me, now and always.” This completes the vocal
    component.

The Essentials of Practice **_71_**


**Imagination**
The imaginal component of the Elemental Cross uses a spe-
cific set of images held in the mind during each phase of the
ritual. The sort of inner work central to this component of
magical practice is often called “visualization,” but this term
only touches one portion of the process, because imagination
isn’t limited to the visual dimension. People blind since
birth, for example, often have powerful imaginations fo-
cused on the senses of sound and touch, and these can be just
as effective in magic as the visual imagination that sighted
people have. You’ll find that when you hear and feel and
smell and taste your mental imagery, as well as seeing it, the
stronger and more vivid it will be, and the more effectively
it will set nwyfre into motion.
Modern industrial culture distrusts and fears the human
imagination, so it’s no surprise that many people nowadays
are convinced that they can’t use it at all. A simple mental
trick makes it easy to get past this limiting belief and use the
mental gifts every human being has. Instead of trying to visu-
alize something, simply imagine what it would look like if
you _could_ visualize it.The image in your mind of “what it
would look like” is exactly what you’re trying to achieve, and
any defects in it will be cured with regular practice.

1. As you raise your hands above your head, imagine that
    the Sun is far above your head, radiating golden light
    downward toward you. As your hands join and descend
    to your forehead, imagine a ray of golden light descend-
    ing to the crown of your head and passing within,to a
    point at the center of your head, where it forms a sphere
    of brilliant light a few inches across. Feel the warmth of
    the light radiating outward through your head. Hold this
    image as you invoke your first power.

**_72_** Part One: The Foundations of Druid Magic


2. As you bring your hands down to chest level, imagine
    that the ray of golden light descends further, creating a
    second sphere of brilliant light at your solar plexus. From
    there, as you invoke your second power, the ray extends
    straight down through the midline of your body into the
    ground beneath you, extending all the way down to the
    heart of the Earth. Visualize this as a brilliant sphere of
    silvery-green light, the color of sunlight on moving water,
    as large and bright as the Sun but located far below you.
3. As your right hand goes out to your right, imagine a
    second ray streaming out to the right from the sphere
    of light at your solar plexus, flowing through your right
    side and across the palm of your right hand in a straight
    line out to infinite distance. Hold this image as you
    invoke your third power.
4.As your left hand goes out to your left,imagine a third
    ray streaming out to the left from the sphere of light at
    your solar plexus, flowing through your left side and
    across the palm of your left hand in a straight line out
    to infinite distance. Hold this image as you invoke your
    fourth power.The pattern up to this point is shown in
    Figure 3-1.
5.As you extend your arms and turn your palms forward,
    imagine two more rays of light streaming out from the
    sphere at your solar plexus. One of them goes straight
    ahead of you into infinite distance, the other straight
    out behind you into infinite distance. At this point the
    sphere of light in your solar plexus is the meeting place
    of six rays of light extending above, below, to your left,
    to your right, ahead of you, and behind you. Hold this
    image as you say the final prayer, invocation, or bless-
    ing, then let the imagery fade from your mind. This
    completes the imaginal component.

Figure 3-1 The Elemental Cross
```
**Intention**
The intentional component of the Elemental Cross draws on
the mythic image of the center of the world.Every traditional
culture identified some spot on the Earth’s surface as the cen-
ter of all things, and oriented everything else in the world
around it.For the Welsh,according to the tale of Lludd and
Llevellys from the _Mabinogion,_ it was in the vicinity of Ox-
ford. For the Irish it was the Hill of Uisnech, where Mide,
the Druid of the Milesians, kindled the first Belteinne fire.
The ancient Greeks believed the center of the world was at
Delphi; a classical myth told how Zeus released two eagles
from opposite ends of the Earth at the same moment, flying
toward one another, and they met in the air above Delphi. In
the Middle Ages,Christians,Jews, and Muslims all identified
Jerusalem as the exact center of the world, and the Stone of
Foundation beneath the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem was
thought to be the first piece of solid ground to congeal out
of primal chaos at the Creation.

forehead center

solar plexus center
```

These traditions have deep roots in the lore of Earth
magic, for the subtle dance of nwyfre uniting people and the
land comes into focus at certain places, and makes them cen-
ters where creative energy wells up from the depths. Still,
what time and the Earth’s own nwyfre do on a grand scale,
magical ritual can do in a more focused and temporary way.
A note in _Black Elk Speaks,_ one of the classics of Native
American spirituality, offers a key insight into this process.
Comments John Neihardt,who took down the Lakota holy
man’s words, “Black Elk said the mountain he stood on in his
vision was Harney Peak in the Black Hills. ‘But anywhere is
the center of the world,’ he added” (Neihardt, 1988, p. 43).
Standing at the center of the world,in other words, is a
condition of consciousness, not a matter of being in one
place and not another. When you stand at the center of the
world,as Black Elk and all the world’s holy men and women
have done, everything becomes visible to you because you
stand at a point midway between every pair of opposites.
East and west, north and south, above and below, and all the
things symbolized by these directions, are all equally close
and equally far away.Entering this state,the state of balance
at the center of the world, is the intention of the Elemental
Cross.
Of course, a single performance of a simple rite like this
one won’t get you to the place where all opposites come into
balance, unless you’re on the verge of getting there all by
yourself. That’s the point behind daily practice. As you for-
mulate the intention of standing at the center of the world
day after day, using the tools of symbolism, gesture, voice,
and imagination to give it form, the intention becomes a
point of contact where the three currents of Druid magic
flow together and intention becomes reality.

The Essentials of Practice **_75_**


**_The Circulation of Light_**
Asthe Elemental Cross begins the Sphere of Protection, the
Circulation of Light completes it. This is not, strictly speak-
ing, a complete ritual in itself, but simply takes the intention
of the earlier phases of the ritual and extends it in space,
using the imagination alone.
As soon as you finish the Elemental Cross, pause, and be
aware of the sphere of light at your solar plexus. Then imag-
ine the sphere enlarging until it surrounds you on all sides,
extending out as far as you choose.With practice, you can
make this any space you decide to protect—a room, a build-
ing, a valley, a bioregion, the entire Earth—but to begin
with, make it a sphere around ten feet across, centered on
your solar plexus and surrounding you on all sides. Pause
again,concentrating on the image of the sphere of light
around you, and concentrate on the idea that no hostile or
unwanted influence can pass into the light from outside.
Once you have established this image solidly, the next
step is to spin the sphere around you in three different direc-
tions.This can be tricky to picture mentally, so it’s often use-
ful to get a ball—any size will do—and try out the motions
with the ball first.Figure 3-2 shows the three rotations of
the sphere, as though they were being done by someone fac-
ing you. The first one goes over your head, down in front,
under your feet and up the back; the second goes around
from left to right in front, and from right to left behind you;
the third goes from above down to your right, under your
feet, and then up to your left.
The trick is to start with the first rotation, add the sec-
ond without stopping the first, and then add the third while
keeping the other two going. This is where the ball comes in
handy as a help to your imagination. Hold your hands in
front of you, level with each other, with the ball poised

**_76_** Part One: The Foundations of Druid Magic


**Figure 3-2 Three Rotations**

between your two index fingers so it can spin freely. Start
the ball spinning by pushing up with your thumbs against the
side of the ball nearest you. This is the first rotation.
Next,imagine that the ball is the Earth and you’re the
Moon.Walk around the ball in a clockwise circle, leaving it
at the center of the circle, while keeping it spinning between
your index fingers by pushing up with your thumbs. Now
the ball is spinning in two directions at once—over and
under, moved by your thumbs, and around from left to right,
moved by your feet.Those are the first two rotations.
Now, while you keep the ball spinning and keep walking
around it in a circle, move your left index finger up and your
right index finger down, turning the ball over as it spins.
Unless you’re double-jointed, you won’t be able to take it
past half a turn, but imagine that it keeps on turning over
and over, left to right, as it spins in the two other directions.
Once you have the image, put the ball away, and get ready to
do the same thing with energy.
Start where you left off, with the sphere of light sur-
rounding you. Just like the ball, it begins to rotate the first
way, up from behind and down from in front. Make the
motion slow at first, and then gradually speed it up until the
sphere is whirling around you in a blur of speed.

The Essentials of Practice **_77_**

```
First rotation Second rotation Third rotation
```

Keep it spinning, and then add the second rotation, just
as you did with the ball by walking in a circle around it.
Imagine it moving slowly at first, then faster and faster, until
the second rotation also becomes a blur of speed. Then add
the third rotation, as you did by moving your index fingers,
slowly at first again and then faster and faster, until you see
yourself surrounded by a sphere of white light spinning in all
directions at once. Imagine all three rotations reaching infi-
nite speed,so that the sphere around you appears to be per-
fectly still.
This final stillness concludes the ritual. You can make a
closing gesture at this point—for example, crossing your
arms in front of your chest and saying something on the
order of “I thank the powers for their blessings”—or not, as
you prefer. Pause for a moment, and notice how the space
around you feels.At first you may not notice much, but with
time and regular practice this will change. Pay attention to
what you perceive,and note howchanges in the way you do
the ritual affect the way the space feels afterward.

**Divination**
Divination, the second leg of the cauldron of Druid magic,
takes many forms. Of the dozens of methods of divination
practiced in the Druid community today, most would have
been completely unfamiliar not only to the ancient Druids
but to the founders of the Druid Revival as well. This is an
excellent sign, as it shows that Druidry is alive and growing
from its deep roots.
One system the old Druids might have recognized, how-
ever, is based on the Ogham alphabet. Reintroduced to the
Pagan community by Colin Murray in the late twentieth cen-
tury, Ogham divination has become a popular art in the

**_78_** Part One: The Foundations of Druid Magic


modern Druid community, and it has much to offer the
Druid mage in training—not least because anything that will
help you become more familiar with Ogham will make it
easier for you to use the fews in magic.
To practice Ogham divination, you’ll need twenty-five
cards or sticks that can be marked with the Ogham fews;
sticks are more traditional, but many people prefer cards
because they are easier to handle. You can purchase several
different versions of Ogham cards, and many Pagan stores
now sell Ogham sticks as well; you can also make either one.
In either case, if you make a set, be sure you have a way of
telling when the few is upright and when it’s reversed, since
this makesa difference in divination. A spot of black ink on
the bottom of each Ogham stick will do, and for cards, writ-
ing the name of each few on the top of its card works well.
Like ritual,divination should be practiced every day, and
a basic three-few spread does well for this purpose. Shuffle
the sticks or cards thoroughly, and then deal out three in the
form of the Three Rays of Light, one of the classic Druid sym-
bols, as shown in Figure 3-3. The first few goes on the left,
the place of the Ray of Knowledge;it represents what comes

to the situation from the past. The second goes on the right,
the place of the Ray of Power; it represents the potentials for
change in the situation, and leads into the future. The third
goes at the center, the place of the Ray of Peace; it represents
your position in the present, between past and future.
Turning three Ogham fews into a meaningful reading
takes practice, and this is one of the reasons why daily prac-
tice is so important. Even with practice, interpreting the
reading is the difficult part of divination for many people,
but it doesn’t have to be that way.
One of the chief obstacles to interpretation is the idea
that each symbol in the divinatory alphabet has to have one
and only one meaning. The process becomes much easier
when you remember that the symbols of a divination system
are as many faceted as the images of dreams. The following
notes on the meanings of the Ogham alphabet should be
treated as a starting point for your own intuition, not as a
cage that restricts what the card can mean.It can help to
look at the meanings listed and ask yourself, “What does this
make me think of? What does this bring to mind?” Pay atten-
tion to the answers that surface,no matter how strange they
may seem.
One very effective way to learn divination, with Ogham
or any other oracle, is to ask the same simple question each
day—”What do I most need to know about the day before
me?”—and write down your interpretation of the reading.
Go back a day later and compare the symbols you cast, and
the interpretation you gave to them, with the events of the
day.With time and regular practice, this process will teach
you the meanings each of the Ogham fews have for you, and
help guide the growth of your own intuitive abilities.
Can you use another divination system instead of
Ogham? Of course, but Ogham is more than just an oracle.

What the Hebrew alphabet is to Cabalistic magic and the
runes are to Norse magic, the Ogham is to Druid magic. Many
of the magical methods given in later chapters rely on the
fews. Use them for divination, and you’ll find that they and
their meanings stick in the memory much more quickly.

**Meditation**
Meditation, the third leg of the cauldron of Druid magic,
also provides the Druid path as a whole with its core inner
practice. Nearly all the traditional Druid orders teach some
kind of meditation, and most expect students to practice it

The Essentials of Practice **_87_**


regularly. The daily experience of turning inward in medita-
tion is essential to the Druid path of nature spirituality, since
it brings you into contact with the part of nature closest to
you—the nature of your own body, enaid, and mind. As
Philip Carr-Gomm reminds us in his inspiring book, _The
Druid Way,_ “Nature isn’t only out there!”
Any form of meditation that directs attention inward,
toward your own inner life and experience, makes a valuable
part of a Druid path. The particular form of meditation
taught and practiced in AODA and many other traditional
Druid orders, however, fits particularly well with the needs
of Druidry as well as those of Druid magic.The basics of this
method can be summed up in a fewpages, and this is what I
have done here; a more complete discussion appears in _The
Druidry Handbook._
The most important detail about this method is also the
easiest part to describe. Most of the methods of meditation
practiced in the Western world nowadays teach the student
to stop thinking entirely by chanting a mantra, focusing on
breathing or the body, concentrating on thought-stopping
paradoxes,or some similar tactic.These methods can get
you to mystical states of consciousness, but shutting down
the mind has its drawbacks as well. Too often people who
pursue such methods intensively reach impressive spiritual
states, but lose their ability to think clearly or deal with life
in the ordinary world.
From a Druid perspective, thinking is natural to human
beings, and trying to get rid of what is natural is always a mis-
take.Thus Druid meditation focuses on training the mind
and harmonizing it with the rest of the self, not on shutting
it down. This is done by directing the mind toward a previ-
ously chosen image or idea, called the “theme” of the medi-

**_88_** Part One: The Foundations of Druid Magic


tation. After some simple preparations, the meditator
explores the theme in thought, restraining the mind when-
ever it tries to stray from the theme but giving it free rein to
follow the theme as far as it can. This kind of meditation is
called “discursive meditation,” because it often takes the form
of an inner discourse or dialogue as the mind works with the
subject matter given by the theme.
This sort of meditation has the same benefits as any
other method of meditation—it clears and centers your mind,
relaxes and heals your body, and teaches you to shape your
own inner life rather than being pushed around passively by
it—but it has another benefit most others lack. Most occult
traditions in the Western world use enigmatic images, sym-
bols, and texts to conceal the deeper dimensions of their
teachings.These are meant to be “unpacked” through discur-
sive meditation,and they give up their secrets in no other
way. Once you learn to meditate in this way, you have the
key to most traditional occult lore.
The best way to harvest themes for meditation is to note
down ideas and images that catch your attention, because
they suggest interesting possibilities to you or because you
can’t figure them out at all. The minor themes are often just
as important as the big ones. Beginners often choose big
themes and either flounder about or skate over the surface,
missing the potential depths of the practice. As a general
rule, if your theme takes more than a short sentence to
describe, it’s too large for a single meditation and should be
broken up into smaller bits,then put together later on.

**_Posture and Practical Issues_**
Start meditation practice by sitting down on a chair with a
plain, cushionless seat. Sit far enough forward on it that your

The Essentials of Practice **_89_**


lower back isn’t resting against the back of the chair. Your
feet should be flat on the floor. Straighten your back without
stiffening it, and hold your head upright, without letting it
slump forward. Your hands rest palm down on your thighs,
and your elbows are at your sides. This posture for medita-
tion, unlike the cross-legged positions common in Eastern
systems of meditation, doesn’t seal your energies off from
the rest of the cosmos. As Druids, we always participate in
the dance of energies through the wider world.
Most people find it useful to meditate in the same place
each day, and at the same time of day or the same point in the
daily cycle for those who have variable schedules—right be-
fore breakfast, say. An outdoor setting is best, when weather
and circumstances permit,but a corner of your bedroom or
some other convenient indoor place will do nearly as well. If
you can do so,meditate facing east, facing into the currents
of energy flowing through the subtle body of the Earth; this
is good for health and also helps develop the mind.A clock
placed so that you can see it without moving your head com-
pletes the setting.
Meditation practice consists of three stages, which
should be learned one at a time. Start out doing only the first
stage, relaxation, in your daily meditation practice, and con-
tinue at that level until you feel that you have a good sense of
the technique. Then add the next stage, breathing, and con-
tinue practicing relaxation and breathing each day until both
of them feel familiar and comfortable. Only then go on to
the third stage, meditation itself.

**_Relaxation Stage_**
Start each practice by settling into the meditation position,
and then consciously relax each part of your body, starting

**_90_** Part One: The Foundations of Druid Magic


with your head and moving step-by-step down to the soles of
your feet. Let the tensions drain downward, like water, and
imagine them flowing out through your feet into the Earth,
which absorbs them and transforms them into energy. Leave
your body with only the muscular tensions you need to stay
sitting up. Take as much time at this as you wish. The more
muscular tension you can release, the easier and more pro-
ductive your meditation practice will be.
Practice relaxation by itself until your body feels com-
fortably poised as soon as you settle into your meditation pos-
ture and begin relaxing. At that point, add the next stage.

**_Breathing Stage_**
After going through the process of relaxation, spend a few
minutes paying conscious attention to your breath, breathing
in and out slowly,evenly, and fully. A traditional breathing
exercise called the “Rhythmic Breath” is commonly used
here. Breathe slowly in while counting slowly and silently
from one to three; hold your breath in, while counting from
one to three; breathe out, counting from one to three; and
hold the breath out,with the lungs empty,while counting
from one to three, and repeat.The counts should all be at the
same pace, and the breath should be held in or out with the
muscles of the chest and diaphragm. Don’t shut your throat
during this practice, as this can lead to lung problems.
Practice relaxation, followed by breathing, as your daily
meditation practice until the rhythm of the Rhythmic Breath
becomes automatic and you can remain comfortably relaxed
for five minutes of breathing. At that point, add the third
stage.

The Essentials of Practice **_91_**


**_Meditation Stage_**
After relaxation and five minutes or so of rhythmic breath-
ing, turn your attention to the theme of the meditation. State
the theme silently to yourself in a few words, or visualize it
before you in a single image. Hold it in your mind for a short
time, and then start thinking about it, turning it over and
over in your mind, exploring its implications and connec-
tions. Choose one of these that appeals to you, and follow it
out as far as you can. Keep working at it for the period of
time you choose for your meditation—ten minutes is good
to start with—and then pay attention to your breathing or
practice the Rhythmic Breath again for a minute or so to
help make the transition back to ordinary awareness.
When your thoughts veer from the theme during medi-
tation,as they almost certainly will in the early stages of
training, don’t simply yank them back to the theme. Instead,
follow your straying thoughts back to the point where they
left the train of thought you were following, and proceed
from there. If you started out meditating on the Sphere of
Protection and ended up thinking about Aunt Martha’s tor-
tilla casserole,say, ask yourself what you were thinking about
just before the casserole came to mind.If it was Aunt
Martha, what came before that? Her apartment, of course,
where a little statue in her china hutch came to mind when
you were trying to think about the Welsh goddess Elen, the
young goddess you invoke in the Sphere of Protection. Over
time, this habit of tracing back your thoughts will teach your
mind to return to your theme as readily as it strays from it.
Meditation should be practiced every day. Once you’ve
learned all three phases of the practice, five minutes of relax-
ation, five minutes of breathing, and ten minutes of actual
meditation makes a good session for beginners. Add more

**_92_** Part One: The Foundations of Druid Magic


time gradually, as you learn how to keep your mind focused
for longer and longer intervals.

**The Druid Journal**
All the practices in this book should be recorded in your
Druid journal. What is a Druid journal? Simply a notebook
in which you keep details of your practices, workings and
magical experiences. A sample might run like this:

```
January 19th, 2008
```
```
6:30 AM, morning meditation, 10 minutes.Theme was the
quote from Morris Berman in the first chapter. I tried to see
the connection between disenchantment and the ecological
crisis, and realized just how deeply the notion of the world
as dead matter and raw material is woven into modern
thought. Mental focus was shaky at first but I managed to
get it under control after a little while.
```
```
7:08 AM, morning divination. Ngetal reversed, Koad, Beith.
I feel stuck in my current situation, but with appropriate
guidance and patience I can make a new beginning.
```
```
7:10 PM, Sphere of Protection. Fairly strong. For the first
time I got a definite sense of standing at the center of the
world—just a glimpse, probably, but it was pretty intense.
```
Many magical and Druid orders require their initiates to
keep a journal as part of their training program, and AODA
is among them. A journal is one good way to encourage peo-
ple to do the course work regularly, and an order that re-
quires students to pass an examination before they go on to
the next degree, as AODA does, can have students go back
into their journals and pull out details of their work for the

The Essentials of Practice **_93_**


examination.Too often, though, this comes to be seen as the
entire point of keeping a magical journal, and the real value
of the exercise gets lost.
The key to using a magical journal is that it allows you
to check your memory against an objective record. This is
partly a way of sidestepping problems with selective mem-
ory. In magical training, as in anything else, memory bends
to suit the needs of the ego. For example, if you skip prac-
tices more often than not, selective memory can still con-
vince you that you’re hard at work on your magical training.
Your Druid journal can tell you otherwise.
Your Druid journal also provides a record of magical
experiences, and these eventually become one of the most
important resources you have in magical training. It often
happens that in magical states of consciousness, the mage
receives occult symbols,teachings, and techniques. Most of
the material that fills the pages of textbooks of magic today
started out as entries in someone’s journal.Your magical
journal can serve the same purpose. This is why you should
copy down the details of each practice while they’re still
fresh in your memory,before the details have slipped away,
and why you should copy down everything, not just what
seems important at the time. A week, a month, or a year
later, the detail that didn’t seem important at the time may
turn out to be the key to new realms of magic.

## PartTwo The Practice of Druid Magic



## Chapter 4 The Gates of the Elements

Learning and practicing the exercises in chapter 3 will build
a firm foundation for the rest of your magical work.The first
step beyond the basics starts, ironically enough, by returning
to one of them.The Sphere of Protection ritual contains a
middle section, the Calling of the Elements, that you should
learn and practice once you can do the Elemental Cross and
Circulation of Light easily and effectively from memory.
The Calling of the Elements consists of seven separate
parts, working with the seven elements of air, water, fire,
earth, spirit above, spirit below, and spirit within. The ritual
calls for youto invoke all seven elements, and banish the
unbalanced aspects of four of them. _Invoke_ literally means
“call in,” and _banish_ means to send away. In terms of the the-
ory of magic introduced back in chapter 1, to invoke is to fill
the nwyfre of your own enaid with the resonance of a sym-
bol, and to banish is to close your enaid against a symbol so
that it finds no response in you. This is one of the essential
skills of practical magic; it builds abilities you can put to use
in many other ways.


**Invoking and Banishing
by the First Gate**
Like the Elemental Cross, each of the seven invocations and
four banishings in the Sphere of Protection ritual combines
symbolism, gesture, voice, and imagination to formulate an
intention. In this first Gate, we’ll go through them one at a
time.

**_Symbolism_**
In the traditions of modern Druidry, the eastern quarter of
the world is above all else the place where the Sun rises, and
this symbolism of light spills over into air, the element as-
signed to the east. Morning, springtime, and every other
image of newborn light and life correspond to this Gate, and
so does inspiration and illumination of every kind. Another
symbol of air is the one shown here:a circle with a line
extending up from its top.This represents air being born from
the infinite potential of spirit.

**_Gesture_**
Face east. Using the first two fingers of your right hand, trace
the symbol of air in front of you. Start where the circle joins
the line, tracing the circle in a clockwise direction, and then
trace the upward line.This is the invoking form of the symbol.
Hold your hand still for a time, and then trace the symbol of
air in its banishing form;first trace the circle in a _counterclock-
wise_ direction,and then draw the upward line.

**_Voice_**
Like the Elemental Cross, the invocations and banishings in
the Calling of the Elements can and should be changed to use
the symbols that define the universe for you. If you are com-

**_98_** Part Two: The Practice of Druid Magic


fortable working with gods and goddesses, or other person-
alized spiritual powers, choose one that corresponds to the
element of air.
In the Welsh Druid lore that provides so much of the
magical symbolism in modern Druidry, the god Hu the
Mighty fills this role. The “Great Druid God” of AODA tra-
dition, Hu is the active power of divine creation in the
world. His name is pronounced with the Welsh _u;_ to pro-
nounce this,purse your lips as though you meant to say
“ooooh,” and then—without changing the position of your
lips—try tosay “eeee” instead. An Irish god appropriate to
this element is Aengus Og (pronounced “AHN-gus OHG”),
the youthful god of love and life, while Christian Druids usu-
ally invoke Saint Raphael the Archangel as the regent of air.
These names can be spoken in the ordinary way, but
what occultists call “vibration”makes a more magically effec-
tive method. Vibration, in occult jargon, is a special way of
chanting magically powerful names and words. To learn it,
try it with a simple vowel tone like “ah” or “oh.” Draw in a
deep breath, and chant the sound, stretching it out until you
run out of breath.As you make the sound,try changing the
shape of your mouth and the quality of the tone until you get
a buzzing or tingling feeling in your throat and chest, or else-
where in your body. The effect may be slight at first, but
practice will make it stronger. It will also bring the ability to
focus the vibration at various points of the body, and in time
to focus it outside the body as well.
In ritual work,vibrate the name of the god,angel, or
other spiritual being ruling the element or other symbolic
pattern you invoke, and speak any other words you wish to
use in a more ordinary voice. For example, invoking air in the
east, I say, “By the hawk of May in the heights of morning, and

The Gates of the Elements **_99_**


in the great name Hu, I invoke the air, its gods, its spirits and
its powers.” The name of Hu is the only word I vibrate, and I
extend it to a full breath, letting the vibration resonate all
through my enaid. I then say, “May I receive the blessings of
air,” and when I receive those blessings, I say, “I thank the air for
its gifts.” When banishing, I say, “And with the help of the pow-
ers of air, I banish from within me and around me all unbal-
anced manifestations of air. I banish them far away from me.”
If you prefer to invoke the elements in an impersonal
form, simply leave out the divine name and the vibration.
While invoking, for example, you can say words like these:
“By the hawk of May in the heights of morning, I invoke the
air, its gods, its spirits, and its powers. May I receive the
blessings of air this day.” Pause to receive the blessings, then
say, “I thank the air for its gifts.” When banishing, say words
like these:“And with the help of the powers of air, I banish
from within me and around me all unbalanced manifesta-
tions of air.I banish them far away from me.”

**_Imagination_**
As you trace the invoking air symbol,imagine that your fin-
gers are drawing it in the air in front of you in brilliant yel-
low flame. When you finish and point to the center, imagine
the circle filled with paler, transparent yellow flame. Then,
as you speak the words invoking the powers and blessings of
air, concentrate on air. Picture before you a morning sky,
modeling the image on what dawn looks like in the land
where you live. Feel the wind and smell the fresh morning
air,again using your memories of real mornings. As you
imagine this, feel the powers and blessings of air flowing into
you. Imagine that the yellow light of air flows into your body
through your solar plexus, and feel that you have become so
light and nimble that you could dance on the winds.

**_100_** Part Two: The Practice of Druid Magic


When you thank the air and trace the banishing form of
the symbol, release the imagery of air. Concentrate on the
idea that all airy imbalances in your life are swept away by
the winds and lost in the vastness of the skies. Take as much
time as you need on this visualization.

**_Intention_**
The basic intention of each of the seven invocations and four
banishings in the Calling of the Elements is the same.When
you invoke, you attune your enaid to one of seven great sym-
bolic patterns and take on its qualities. These are the bless-
ings you call into yourself. When you banish, you define the
way your enaid participates in the elemental pattern to
remove all unbalanced and harmful influences from yourself
and your life, sending them back to their proper place in the
cycle of things.
You don’t need to force the element to do these things,
and it’s a serious mistake to think of magic in terms of com-
manding and forcing nwyfre to obey you. The seven ele-
ments aren’t entities outside you that need to be controlled.
Equally,they aren’t parts of yourself that you can boss
around. Instead, the elements are relationships that connect
you with the world. When you invoke, you simply attune
your enaid to focus on a particular set of relationships, then
set that corresponds to one of the elements. When you ban-
ish, you use that relationship to redefine the problematic
parts of your life.The ritual itself expresses these intentions,
and trying to make the intentions happen by willpower is
like trying to make a river flow faster by pushing the water.
For the next two or three weeks, include this section in
your daily practice. Perform the Elemental Cross, then in-
voke and banish by air, then perform the Circulation of
Light.Practice it until you have this phase of the ritual by

heart, and can feel the air respond to the ritual. During the
time you spend on this, pay attention to any symbols relat-
ing to air that show up in other aspects of your life.You can
also work with air using the following method.

**_Receptive Working_**
Air in all its different moods and movements forms a reser-
voir of nwyfre on which you can draw. Choose a condition
of the air that expresses a quality you would like to develop
in yourself. If you have a hard time settling your mind and
centering yourself, choose the still air before sunrise; if you
feel that you lack strength, choose a time of strong wind; if
you feel burdened and stuck in a rut, choose a time when the
breeze is light and dancing, and so on.
When the air has the quality you need, go outside and
stand in a place where there is as much open air as possible
around you. If the wind is blowing, face into it; otherwise,
face east.Focus your attention on your solar plexus. This
area is to magical energies what the nose and mouth are to
physical air. You breathe energies in and out through your
solar plexus all the time without noticing it.This practice
teaches you to notice it and make use of it.
Imagine, as you stand there in the open air, that you are
drawing the quality you need out of the air into yourself with
each breath. If you’re seeking stillness, and you’re standing
outside in the perfectly still air of a winter dawn, imagine
that with each breath you draw in, you draw stillness in
through the solar plexus. As you breathe out, imagine that
stillness spreads out from the solar plexus to fill yourwhole
body. Do this three or nine times, concentrating on what you
are doing, then thank the powers of air in your own words.
This completes the exercise.

**_102_** Part Two: The Practice of Druid Magic


**_Active Working_**
When the air doesn’t express the quality you wish to develop
in yourself, you can charge the air with your intention and
then breathe it into yourself. Do this by imagining the air
around you filled with a color that expresses your intention,
as given in Table 4-1. This color helps to anchor a mood or
feeling, and the mood or feeling combines with the spoken
intention to bring you into resonance with patterns in the
nwyfre that will help you accomplish your goal.

**Table 4-1 Color Symbolism**

**Red** is energizing and awakening, and heightens the body’s vitality.
Use it whenever you need strength, courage, and vital power.
**Orange** combines red’s energy with yellow’s clarity; it gives focus and
precision, and balances the nervous system. Use it to direct and
strengthen the mind.
**Yellow** is balancing and uplifting, and brings clarity to the mind and spirit.
Use it to banish depression and summon inspiration.
**Green** combines yellow’s clarity with blue’s receptivity; it fosters growth
and healing, and helps calm the digestive system. Use it for heal-
ing and creativity of all kinds, and also for financial and economic
issues.
**Blue** is passive and receptive, opening the doors of awareness to a wider
world. Use it to heighten intuition and perception, and to work with
dreams.
**Violet** combines active red and receptive blue; it is the color of power, and
awakens psychic and artistic gifts. Use it to find and express your talents.
**White** is the color of pure spirit and unites all the other colors. Use it for
spiritual development of all kinds.

Before you perform the ritual, work out a single word
or phrase or, at most, a short and simple sentence that
expresses your intention. To help yourself focus your mind
more clearly in meditation,for example,you might use

The Gates of the Elements **_103_**


“clarity,” “perfect focus,” or “My mind is clear of unwanted
thoughts.” Take your time, think through the implications of
what you want, and stay clear of ambiguity. One of the rules
of magic is that you get what you ask for, whether or not
what you ask for is what you actually want! It’s also best to
phrase an intention as a statement of the situation you desire,
in the present tense—“My mind is clear” rather than “My
mind will be clear” or “I want my mind to be clear”—so that
your intentionality focuses on a present reality, not a hope
for the future or an unfulfilled desire.
For now, choose an intention that involves shaping your
thoughts, feelings, or attitudes rather than your physical
body or anything outside yourself. Magic can transform any-
thing in the universe of human experience, but it takes prac-
tice and a fair amount of skill to get definite results when
working magic on physical matter or other people’s minds.
Working magic on yourself is easier at first, and the results
usually make themselves known to you sooner and more
dramatically, too. Later on, when you’ve built skill and con-
fidence, you can reach further.
Once you have chosen your intention,imagine that the
air around you is filled with the color that corresponds to the
intention most closely. Repeat the purpose silently three
times,imagining it echoing through the air around you, and
imagine that the air around you becomes an ocean of the
appropriate color—in this case, yellow, the color of clarity.
At the same time, imagine it filled with a mood or feeling
appropriate to your intention—in this case, with a sense of
perfect stillness and clarity.
Then imagine that you’re breathing the yellow light and
the clarity into your body with each inbreath, and breathing
it out with each outbreath, through your solar plexus. As you

**_104_** Part Two: The Practice of Druid Magic


breathe in, imagine the color and the feeling flowing into
your body and filling it completely, so your whole body glows
with the color. As you breathe out, imagine every trace of the
color and mood flowing out of you, so your body is empty of
both, but the space around you is filled with them. Do this
for as long as you wish.
One useful application of this technique is as a prelimi-
nary step for meditation. While doing the rhythmic breath,
imagine yourself breathing in and out an appropriate color.
Pale orange and yellow are the colors most often used for
this,because they foster calm and concentration. Give them
a try and see how they affect your meditation practice.

**Invoking and Banishing
by the Second Gate**
This is the second invocation and banishing, done after you
invoke and banish air,and it follows the same pattern as the
first.
Water in the Druid tradition has meanings not shared by
other magical systems.Wisdom in the old Celtic lore is sym-
bolized by a salmon who dwells in a sacred pool. To Druids,
water is the element of learning,growth,and development,
and it also has close symbolic connections to trees and other
growing things. If air is the flash of inspiration that awakens
the mind, water is the growth of wisdom through study, prac-
tice, and reflection. Its symbol is the triangle pointing down,
representing water’s downward movement.
To invoke and banish by water, turn to the west. With
the first two fingers of your right hand trace a triangle with
one point down, as shown in figure, starting at the bottom
point and tracing clockwise. Visualize it in blue flame, and

The Gates of the Elements **_105_**


then fill it with paler, transparent blue flame.Then say words
like these: “By the salmon of wisdom who dwells in the sacred
pool, and in the great name Esus, I invoke the water, its
gods, its spirits, and its powers. May I receive the blessings
of water this day.” Esus was originally a god of the Celts of
Gaul, and almost nothing is known nowadays about him or
the traditions surrounding him. Back in the nineteenth cen-
tury, however, Druids began invoking Esus as the chief of all
tree spirits, a god of wisdom who sits in the first fork of the
sacred oak. This is how he is invoked here; his name is pro-
nounced “EH-suus,” with the Welsh _u_ again. If you prefer an
Irish god, invoke Manannan, the Irish sea god; his name is
pronounced “mah-NAHN-un.” If you prefer Christian sym-
bolism,Saint Gabriel the archangel is invoked in this quar-
ter, and if you prefer not to work with personal powers, of
course,simply leave out any name.
Pause for a time, and concentrate on water. Imagine the
largest natural body of water in the region where you live. If
you live on the seacoast, imagine the ocean reaching out in
front of you; if you live near a lake or river, imagine that; if
you live in the desert,and water appears only in springs in
rock clefts, imagine one of these.Weave the sounds of water,
whether those are rolling waves or the trickling of a spring,
and the scents of water into your imagery. As you picture all
this,feel the powers and blessings of water flowing into you
through your solar plexus. Imagine your body filled with the
blue light of water, and feel yourself becoming so fluid and
responsive that nothing can contain or restrict you.
Then say,“I thank the water for its gifts,” and trace the
symbol counterclockwise, again from the bottom of the tri-
angle. Say words like the following: “And with the help of
the powers of water, I banish from within me and around me

**_106_** Part Two: The Practice of Druid Magic


all unbalanced manifestations of water. I banish them far
away from me.” Concentrate on the idea that all unbalanced
factors in your life are swept away and drowned in the
depths. Take as much time as you need on this visualization.
For the next two or three weeks, include this section in
your daily practice: perform the Elemental Cross, then
invoke and banish by air, then invoke and banish by water,
then perform the Circulation of Light. Practice it until you
have this phase of the ritual by heart, and can feel the water
respond to the ritual. During the time you spend doing this,
pay attention to any of the symbols of the Gate of Water that
show up in other aspects of your life.You can also work with
the realm of water by using the following methods.

**_Receptive Working_**
The waters ofthe world provide a reservoir of nwyfre that
can be used in your work as a Druid mage. For countless
centuries, peoples around the world have recognized certain
springs and other water sources as specially sacred. If you
have access to one or more traditionally sacred sources of
water,orknowa source of water that seems sacred to you,
you can use the water for a wide range of magical purposes.
Drinking the water from such a place, bathing in it, or laving
(washing a part of your body, such as the third eye center in
your forehead) with it, can amplify your spiritual develop-
ment.When you use the water in one of these ways, clear your
mind of thoughts and simply be aware of the water as clearly
as possible.Allow its energies to work in their own way.
Water also absorbs nwyfre from other sources, and you
can use it to purify yourself or anything else by washing.
Cold water—as close as possible to 39°F, the temperature at
which water absorbs nwyfre most effectively—is best for

The Gates of the Elements **_107_**


this purpose. If you spend time around people or places that
make you uncomfortable, washing with cold water is a good
way to clear away the unwanted nwyfre and the moods or
emotional states it brings with it. Bathing in cold water,
preferably in a stream or the ocean, is also a very effective
way to prepare for magical work or any form of spiritual
development.

**_Active Working_**
You can also charge water with your own intentions, in
much the same way that you charge air in the process of
color breathing. Take a glass or other drinking vessel of
water, and hold it in front of you with both hands. State your
intention in a single sentence,phrase, or word, just as you
did in preparation for color breathing, but concentrate on
the idea that the intention flows into the water and charges
it. Then imagine that the color corresponding most closely
to your intention is flowing into the water from all over the
universe, coloring the water more and more intensely. Build
this imagery as intensely as possible, and then drink the
water,concentrating on the idea that you are absorbing the
energy you have called into the water.
If you decide to use this method to help you remember
your dreams, for example, you might state your intention as
“I remember all my dreams,” saying these words aloud while
holding a glass of water in both hands. Next, imagine blue
light flowing toward the glass from every part of the uni-
verse, concentrating in the water and turning it bright blue.
Hold this image for some time,imagining the water becom-
ing more and more intensely blue, and then drink the water,
feeling the blue light flowing into you and improving your
ability to remember dreams.

**_108_** Part Two: The Practice of Druid Magic


**Invoking and Banishing
by the Third Gate**
This is the third invocation and banishing, and it follows
the same pattern as the first two.While it is learned after the
work with the Gate of Water, for reasons of balance, it is usu-
ally done between air and water, so that you can turn clock-
wise from east to south to west in the course of the ritual.
Fire in the Druid tradition represents unity and every
force and factor that makes diverse things become one. As
the third element, it balances air and water, inspiration from
without and growth from within,by teaching us that no bar-
rier separates the world outside us from the world inside us.
In the unawakened self, it is passion; in the awakened self, it
is intentionality.Its symbol is the triangle pointing up,rep-
resenting the upward movement of flame.
To invoke and banish by fire, turn to the south.With the
first two fingers of your right hand trace a triangle with one
point up, as shown in the figure, starting at the top point and
tracing clockwise. Visualize it in red flame, and then fill it
with transparent red flame. Then say words like these: “By
the white stag in the light of summer,and in the great name
Sul, I invoke the fire, its gods, its spirits, and its powers. May
I receive the blessings of fire this day.”
Sul is the ancient British goddess of the hot springs at
Bath, a goddess of the Sun and also of the fires beneath the
earth; her name is pronounced “SUUL,” with the Welsh _u._ If
you prefer to work with Irish divinities, Brigid (pronounced
“BREEJ”), the goddess of smiths, poets, and healers, is a
good choice for this element. Christian Druids invoke Saint
Michael the archangel in this quarter.
Once you have finished the invocation, pause for a time,
and concentrate on fire. Imagine the hottest day you can

The Gates of the Elements **_109_**


remember in the land where you live, and imagine an old
dry log catching fire in front of you beneath the hot noonday
Sun. Feel the heat from the Sun, the ground, and the flames,
and smell the dry air and the tang of wood smoke. As you
picture this, feel the powers and blessings of fire flowing into
you through your solar plexus. Imagine your body filled with
the red light of fire, and feel yourself become so full of flam-
ing energy that nothing could stand against you.
Then say, “I thank the fire for its gifts,” and trace the sym-
bol counterclockwise, again from the top of the triangle. Say
words like these: “And with the help of the powers of fire, I
banish from within me and around me all unbalanced manifes-
tations of fire. I banish them far away from me.” Concentrate
on the idea that all unbalanced factors in your life are caught
up in the flames and burned away until not even the finest ash
remains.Take as much time as you need on this visualization.
For the next two or three weeks, include this section in
your daily practice:performthe Elemental Cross,then invoke
and banish by air, then invoke and banish by fire, then invoke
and banish by water, then perform the Circulation of Light.
Practice it until you have this phase of the ritual by heart,and
can feel fire respond to the ritual. During the time you spend
doing this, pay attention to any of the symbols of the Gate of
Fire that show up in other aspects of your life. You can also
work with the realm of fire by using the following methods.

**_Receptive Working_**
Like wind and water, fire forms a reservoir of nwyfre for the
Druid mage.In ancient times,according to old legends,
Druids would build bonfires of specially chosen magical
woods and use the flames to work their magic. In a world
where forests need to be preserved and expanded, not sacri-

**_110_** Part Two: The Practice of Druid Magic


ficed to human needs, this form of magical working can rarely
be justified, but there are other ways to get the same effect.
To make a safe, effective, and ecologically sound magical
fire, get a fireproof bowl or small cauldron, preferably of
metal. Put it on a heatproof surface in a place where flames
and heat can rise for several feet without putting anything at
risk. Pour a teaspoon of salt into the bottom of the cauldron.
Pour in half a cup or so of pure grain alcohol, or any other
alcohol that is at least 150 proof (75 percent alcohol). Light
the alcohol with a match, and then sit where you can gaze
into the flames.Watch the flames, keeping your attention on
them and your mind as clear as possible, until the fire goes
out.Allowthe energy of the fire toshine into you, and see
where it takes you and what unity it brings to you.
Like water, fire absorbs and transforms nwyfre, and you
can use it for purification.Set up a magical fire in a place that
needs to be purified, light it, and allow the flames to clear
away unwanted energies. If you have anything in yourself
that needs to be purified or transformed, offer it up to the
fire mentally, and gaze into the flames until the fire goes out.

**_Active Working_**
The same magical fire can be used in an active way to charge
yourself with an intention. Prepare the magical fire as be-
fore. As you light the alcohol, say your intention aloud, and
then sit where you can gaze into the flames.You can imagine
the flames turning an appropriate color as you watch them,
but it works as well to simply look into the flames and allow
the intention to radiate through its light. Continue gazing
into the flames until the last of the fire goes out.
If you want to use this method to strengthen your body’s
health and vitality, for example, you might choose to state

The Gates of the Elements **_111_**


your intention with the phrase “vital force.” Prepare the fire
bowl, and say aloud the words you chose as you light the alco-
hol. Sit and gaze into the flames, and be aware of vital force
flowing into you in the firelight, until the flames go out.

**Invoking and Banishing
by the Fourth Gate**
This is the fourth invocation and banishing, done after you
invoke and banish by air,fire, and water, and it follows the
same pattern as the others.
Earth in the Druid tradition is the symbol of manifesta-
tion, the firm material basis that allows the other elemental
powers to take form in the universe of our experience. In
nature, it takes the shape of soil and stone, the substances that
make the surface of the Earth; the realm of earth’s far depths
belongs to Spirit Below instead. The symbol of earth is the
creative circle of spirit with a line descending downward into
manifestation.
To invoke and banish earth, turn to the north. With the
first two fingers of your right hand trace the symbol of earth.
In the invoking mode it is traced starting from the place
where the circle meets the line and going around the circle
clockwise, then drawing the line downward. Visualize it in
green flame, and then fill it with paler, transparent green
flame. Then say words like the following: “By the great bear
who guards the starry heavens, and in the great name Elen,
I invoke the earth, its gods, its spirits, and its powers. May I
receive the blessings of earth this day.”
The goddess Elen appears in Welsh legend as a goddess of
dawn and springtime, as well as patroness of the old straight
trackways,older than the Romans,that still puzzle wayfarers

**_112_** Part Two: The Practice of Druid Magic


in the British countryside. In Druid Revival lore she became
the goddess of the dragon current flowing along the old
tracks, and thus a powerful symbol of life and strength within
the Earth. If you prefer to work with Irish deities, Boann, the
Irish cow goddess, is a good choice for Earth. Christian
Druids usually invoke Saint Uriel the archangel in this quarter.
When you finish the invocation, pause for a time, and con-
centrate on earth. Imagine the land in which you live, with
whatever vegetation flourishes there growing on it. If you live
in woodland country, see yourself in the forest; if you live on
the plains,imagine yourself on the prairie with tall grasses
bending in the wind; if you live in the desert, picture your-
self amid the red rock and sagebrush. Be sure to bring in the
sounds and scents of the landscape. As you picture this, feel
the powers and blessings of earth flowing into you through
your solar plexus.Imagine your body filled with the green
light of earth, and feel yourself becoming so solid and firm
that you could resist the mightiest force in the universe.
Then say, “I thank the earth for its gifts,” and trace the
symbol in its banishing mode, starting from the place where
the circle joins the line,tracing the circle counterclockwise,
and then draw the line downward. Say words like the follow-
ing:“And with the help of the powers of earth, I banish from
within me and around me all unbalanced manifestations of
earth. I banish them far away from me.” Concentrate on the
idea that all unbalanced factors in your life are swallowed up
by the Earth and buried far beneath soil and stone. Take as
much time as you need on this visualization.
For the next two or three weeks, include this section
in your daily practice: perform the Elemental Cross, then
invoke and banish by air, then invoke and banish by fire, then
invoke and banish by water, then invoke and banish by earth,

The Gates of the Elements **_113_**


then perform the Circulation of Light. Practice it until you
have this phase of the ritual by heart, and can feel the Earth
respond to the ritual. During the time you spend doing this,
pay attention to any of the symbols of the Gate of Earth that
show up in other aspects of your life.You can also work with
the realm of earth by using the following methods.

**_Receptive Working_**
The living Earth beneath your feet is another reservoir of
nwyfre for the Druid mage. Every spot on the Earth’s sur-
face has different magical properties, because the soil and
stone underlying each place affects the nwyfre that flows up
through them. The way a colored filter affects a beam of
white light makes a good metaphor for this effect.In some
places, the energies that rise up through the land foster
human spirituality,and over the centuries, such places have
become holy sites and places of pilgrimage. Other places have
their own effects,and local folklore often points out places
with distinctive powers.
It’s useful to arrange a visit to a holy place venerated by
traditional lore,or a place that is sacred to you whether or
not other people recognize its power, during the time you
spend working with the Fourth Gate. When you go there,
pause for a time outside the sacred area to clear your mind.
Enter the sacred place with the intention of learning from it
and experiencing its energies, and keep your mind free of
ordinary mental chatter while you’re there. If circumstances
permit, spend some time meditating while there, taking the
place itself as the theme for the meditation.Done in this way,
with intention, a visit to a sacred place can be a powerful,
transforming experience.

**_114_** Part Two: The Practice of Druid Magic


**_Active Working_**
You can also charge stones with magical intentions in exactly
the same way you charged air and water. Simply choose a stone
of a convenient size and shape to carry in your pocket.Wash it
with cold water, both to remove dirt and to strip away any
unwanted energies that may have become attached to it in the
past. Leave it out in direct sunlight for an hour or more to fin-
ish the cleansing process.Then pick up the stone and hold it in
front of you by the index fingers and thumbs of both hands.
State your intention in a single sentence,phrase,or
word, but concentrate on the idea that the intention flows
into the stone and charges it. Then imagine that the color
corresponding most closely to your intention is flowing into
the stone from all over the universe, making the stone glow
more and more intensely with that color. Build this imagery
as strongly as possible, then release it, and place the stone in
your pocket, or in a place where you spend plenty of time.
For example, if you want to improve your skills as a musi-
cian,you might define your intention by the phrase “musical
skill” and the color green. Choose and clean a pebble that
suits your fancy,and charge it as described above. Put the
pebble in the room where you practice music most often,
close to the place where you sit or stand while playing.

**Invoking by the Fifth Gate**
This is the fifth invocation, done after you invoke and banish
by air, fire, water, and earth, but no banishing is done with
any of the three forms of spirit. Banishing belongs purely to
the realms of the four material elements,since in the realms
of spirit nothing needs banishing.

The Gates of the Elements **_115_**


Spirit Below represents the deep places of the Earth.The
world that human beings inhabit consists of four overlapping
spheres, one each of fire, air, water, and earth—the upper
atmosphere corresponding to fire; the lower atmosphere to
air; the seas, rivers, lakes, and groundwater to water; and the
solid crust of the planet, to earth. Below that lies a realm as
alien to human life as the furthest reaches of outer space, a
realm of unimaginable heat, pressure, and energy that drives
the continents across the face of the planet and sets the land
trembling with earthquakes. This is the realm of Spirit Be-
low. Its symbol is the plain circle of Spirit.
To invoke Spirit Below, face the same direction you faced
during the Elemental Cross. Trace a clockwise circle below
and in front of you, as though tracing it over an altar. Visual-
ize your fingers drawing the circle in orange flame, and fill it
with paler,transparent orange flame. Then say words like
these: “By the bright heart of the Earth Mother, and in the
great name Ced,I invoke Spirit Below, its gods, its spirits,
and its powers. May I receive the blessings of Spirit Below
this day.”
In Welsh Druid lore,Ced is the goddess of living nature
and the source of all life. Her name is pronounced “KEHD,”
and means “bounty” or “help” in Welsh. If you prefer to work
with Irish divinities, the goddess Danu, mother of all the gods
and goddesses,is a good choice for this element. Christian
Druids often invoke the Virgin Mary at this Station.
When you finish the invocation, pause for a time, and
concentrate on Spirit Below. Picture in your mind’s eye the
ground beneath your feet,the soil and stone that belongs to
the element of earth, and then go deeper, into the heart of
the living planet itself. Feel the immense power that drives
earthquakes and volcanoes, lifts mountains toward the sky,

**_116_** Part One:


and moves entire continents across the face of the planet,
and sense that same power surging through every living
thing from the smallest microbe to the great whales and the
tallest trees.
As you picture all this, feel the powers and blessings of
Spirit Below flowing into you through your solar plexus.
Imagine the rich harvest orange light of spirit below filling
your body, and feel the life force of the planet leaping through
your veins. Take as much time as seems appropriate for this
visualization. Then say, “I thank Spirit Below for its gifts.”
For the next two or three weeks, include this section in
your daily practice. Perform the Elemental Cross, then in-
voke and banish by air, fire, water, and earth, then invoke
Spirit Below, and then perform the Circulation of Light.
Practice it until you have this phase of the ritual by heart, and
can feel Spirit Belowrespond to the ritual.During the time
you spend doing this, pay attention to any symbols of the
Gate of Spirit Below that show up in other aspects of your
life. You can also work with the realm of Spirit Below by
using the following methods.

**_Receptive Working_**
The deep places of the Earth are the home of the telluric
current, one of the two primary currents of nwyfre used in
Druid magic. The telluric current flows through the crust
and takes on the qualities of stones and metals as it flows
through them. It can be contacted anywhere in the realms of
the four elements.
A useful way to draw on the telluric current is the recep-
tive working for Spirit Below, the Telluric Nwyfre exercise.
It should be done in a place where you can stand on bare
ground, grass, or some other natural surface.

The Gates of the Elements **_117_**


Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart with your
elbows out a few inches from your sides, your forearms and
hands parallel to the ground, wrists straight, palms facing
down and fingers pointing forward, as though you were rest-
ing your hands and forearms on a flat surface to either side of
you. Relax your arms as much as possible and spread your fin-
gers gently apart.Try to feel the presence of the Earth beneath
you; with practice, you’ll begin to sense a current of energy
flowing up from below. Breathe slowly and deeply for one to
three minutes, feeling energy flowing into your fingertips.
Then bring them inward toward the vital center an inch
below your navel, stopping a few inches from your body,
palms toward you and fingertips nearly touching. Imagine the
Earth currents flowing from your fingertips into the midline
of your body. After a short time, move your hands slowly
upward,maintaining the imagery, pouring the telluric cur-
rent into the midline of your body from the vital center up to
the throat center.At this point separate your hands, sweeping
them up and out to your sides, and bow deeply, then return
to the first position with hands turned toward the earth.
Three or nine cycles of the exercise are enough.

**_Active Working_**
The active working for Spirit Below belongs to a more
advanced level of practice and is covered in a later section of
this book.

**Invoking by the Sixth Gate**
This is the sixth invocation, done after you invoke and ban-
ish by air, fire, water, and earth, and invoke Spirit Below.
Spirit Above represents the universe beyond the limits of the

**_118_** Part Two: The Practice of Druid Magic


Earth. Just as the world we inhabit, with its four elemental
spheres, stops a few miles below our feet where the Earth’s
crust gives way to the mantle, it stops a few miles above our
heads at the borders of space. Beyond these are the vast
reaches where stars and planets circle through the void.This
realm shares the same symbol as Spirit Below, the plain cir-
cle of spirit.
To invoke Spirit Above, turn to face the same direction
you faced during the Elemental Cross.Trace a clockwise cir-
cle above you, visualizing it in violet flame. Fill it with paler,
transparent violet flame. Then say words like these: “By the
Sun in its glory, the father of light, and in the great name
Celi,I invoke Spirit Above, its gods, its spirits, and its pow-
ers. May I receive the blessings of Spirit Above this day.”
In Welsh Druid traditions, Celi is the hidden god of the
heavens,the original source of the three rays of light that
brought the worlds into being. His name is pronounced
“KEH-lee.” If you prefer to work with Irish gods and god-
desses, the Dagda is a good choice for this element; his
name, pronounced “DOY-da,” means “the excellent god,” and
he is the father of the Irish gods.Christian Druids usually
invoke Christ in this Station.
When you have finished the invocation, pause for a time,
and concentrate on Spirit Above. Picture in your mind’s eye
the Sun at midheaven above you, surrounded by the planets
in their orbits, with numberless stars scattered across the
infinite heavens beyond. Sense the vastness of space, the cold
pure starlight that fills it,and the perfect order that governs
all the worlds in their courses.
As you picture all this, feel the powers and blessings of
Spirit Above flowing into you. Imagine the intense purple
light of Spirit Above filling your body through your solar

The Gates of the Elements **_119_**


plexus, and feel your awareness opening outward so that, for
a moment, you seem to understand the whole cosmos. Take
as much time as seems appropriate for this visualization.Then
say, “I thank Spirit Above for its gifts.”
For the next two or three weeks, include this section in
your daily practice: perform the Elemental Cross, then
invoke and banish by air, fire, water, and earth, then invoke
Spirit Below and Spirit Above, and then perform the Cir-
culation of Light. Practice it until you have this phase of the
ritual by heart, and can feel Spirit Above respond to the rit-
ual. During the time you spend doing this, pay attention to
any of the symbols of the Gate of Spirit Above that show up
in other aspects of your life. You can also work with the
realm of Spirit Above by using the following methods.

**_ReceptiveWorking_**
The heavens are a potent reservoir of power for magic, and
every star and planet has its own magical energy that can be
experienced and used.The most powerful and positive force
in the skies of our Earth, though, is the Sun, the source of
light and life for our world,and your work with Spirit Above
should focus on the Sun’s energy to begin with. Later, as you
gain experience, you can study other branches of this lore.
A useful way to draw on Spirit Above through the light
and nwyfre of the Sun is the Solar Nwyfre Exercise. This
should be done in the morning, between dawn and 10:00
AM, when the skies are clear. Find a place outside where you
can stand in the Sun’s rays, wearing as little clothing as pos-
sible.Stand facing the Sun,your feet shoulder-width apart,
your eyes closed, with as much of your body as possible in
sunlight. Raise your arms out to the sides so that your arms
extend to the sides in the formof a cross, your fingertips

**_120_** Part Two: The Practice of Druid Magic


point out to the sides and your palms are turned to face the
Sun. Relax your arms and gently spread your fingers.
Breathe slowly, concentrating on feeling the sunlight soaking
into your body, especially into your fingertips.
After one to three minutes, move both hands inwards to
your head, stopping a few inches from your forehead, palms
facing you, fingers nearly touching each other. Imagine the
sunlight flowing from the fingertips into the middle of your
head.Next,move your hands slowly down from forehead to
solar plexus, maintaining the imagery, pouring light from your
fingertips into the midline of your body. When your hands
reach solar plexus level, sweep them out to the sides and
bowaslowas you can, then return to the first position with
your arms spread wide to greet the Sun. Repeat the entire
process three or nine times.

**_Active Method_**
As with Spirit Below, the active method of working with
spirit above belongs to a more advanced level of practice and
is studied in detail later in this book.

**Invoking by the Seventh Gate**
This is the final invocation of the Sphere of Protection, done
after you invoke and banish by air, fire, water, and earth, and
invoke Spirit Above and Below. Spirit Within, in the Druid
tradition, represents the presence of life and spirit within
everything in the world, including you and me.Where some
religions see human beings as something set apart from the
rest of the world and equally far from the divine, Druidry
recognizes that human beings are part of one great reality,
along with stones, trees, gods, and everything else there is.

The Gates of the Elements **_121_**


For this reason, the symbol of Spirit Within is nothing other
than yourself.
To invoke Spirit Within, remain facing the same direc-
tion you faced during the Elemental Cross, and be aware of
the six powers you have already invoked—air in the east, fire
in the south, water in the west, earth in the north, Spirit
Below in the land beneath you and Spirit Above in the heav-
ens above. See yourself in the midst of these six powers, in
the place of perfect balance among them.Then say words
like the following: “By the six powers here invoked and here
present, and in the grand word Awen, I invoke Spirit Within.
May the universe within me and the universe around me be
in harmony.”
The word _Awen_ is not the name of a god.Rather, it is the
great keyword of the Druid Revival, an archaic Welsh word
meaning “spirit of inspiration.” Through Awen the worlds
came into existence at the beginning of time; through Awen
poets,artists,and all other creative people receive their tal-
ents; through Awen, magic becomes the art of participation
in the great powers of the cosmos. In Druidry it is pronounced
in three parts,drawn out like“Aaaaa-ooooo-ennnnn.”The first
part, the sound of the Ogham few Ailm, stands for the sky
and the solar current; the second, the sound of Ur, stands for
the Earth and the telluric current; the third, the sound of
Nuin,stands for the individual human being as the connect-
ing link between them.
When you finish the invocation, pause for a time, and
concentrate on Spirit Within. Be aware of yourself exactly as
you are,and strive to see every aspect of yourself as a vessel
of infinite powers. Imagine yourself filled with the pure
white light of Spirit Within, and feel yourself in harmony
with the whole cosmos.Take as much time as seems appro-

**_122_** Part Two: The Practice of Druid Magic


priate for this visualization. Then say “I thank Spirit Within
for its gifts.” At this point, focus on the center of energies at
your heart, and proceed at once to the Circulation of Light.
Once you have learned to invoke by all the Seven Gates
and banish by the Gates of the elements, you have learned
the entire Sphere of Protection ritual. Plan on practicing it
once each day for as long as you follow the path of Druid
magic.You can also work with the realm of Spirit Within by
using the following methods.

**_Receptive Working_**
Trees and other green growing things form one of the clas-
sic Druid emblems of Spirit Within. The reasons are com-
plex, touching on the deep reaches of magical philosophy
and practice, but one explanation deserves discussion here.
Human beings and trees exchange energy easily and benefit
each other in the process. Just as trees thrive on carbon diox-
ide, which human beings breathe out as a waste product, and
produce oxygen that human beings need to survive, so the
energy given off by many trees heals humans, while energy
from humans nurtures trees.The same is true of other plants,
and indeed many other things in the natural world, and an
entire system of Druid natural medicine unfolds from the
same principle.
Start the exercise by selecting a tree. Some varieties are
considered more beneficial to human beings than others:
pine, fir, and cedar are held to be best, with oak, beech, and
apple not far behind.Elm is traditionally avoided, as its ener-
gies are unhealthy for human beings.
You’ll need to ask the tree’s permission before exchang-
ing energy with it.Like other nonhuman creatures, trees
don’t understand human language, but they do understand

The Gates of the Elements **_123_**


our emotional patterns—often better than we do. Stand
before the tree, and ask it silently if it’s willing to share its
nwyfre with you. Feel for the answer and behave accordingly.
If the tree gives permission, approach it, and come in
contact with it.There are two traditional ways to do this.The
first focuses the healing effects on your nervous system.To do
this, stand or sit with your back pressed against the trunk.You
can amplify the effect by putting your left hand on the small
of your back with the palm turned out, touching the tree, and
your right hand on your belly just below the navel, palm in.
The second focuses the healing effects on the organs of
your chest and abdomen. To do this, face the tree with your
feet a fewinches away from the base of the trunk, then lean
the front of your body and your forehead against the tree.
You can heighten the effect by placing your hands at forehead
level, forming an upward-pointing triangle with your
thumbs and index fingers, spreading the other fingers com-
fortably.Let your forehead rest in the center of the triangle.
Your arms bend around the trunk, as though embracing the
tree with your elbows.
In either posture,relax your body as much as possible,
and feel the tree as a living presence. An attitude of open-
ness, friendship, and affection will yield the best results
here.Ten or fifteen minutes of quiet presence next to a large,
healthy tree will leave your own nwyfre cleansed and ener-
gized, and will do much the same thing for the tree.

**_Active Working_**
As with Spirit Above and Below, the active working for Spirit
Within belongs to a more advanced level of magical work
and is discussed later in this book.

**_124_** Part Two: The Practice of Druid Magic


## Chapter 5 The Grove of the Druids

The Sphere of Protection ritual forms the foundation of the
system of Druid magic taught in this book. Once you can do
all the phases of that ritual from memory, many other
dimensions of ritual work can be added to it.The first step
in this direction is the use of the Sphere of Protection itself
as a basic ritual for practical magic. One of the advantages of
the Sphere is that this takes nothing more than a change in
the words and intentions in the Calling of the Elements.
Before you take this step, however, you may want to take
another look at the material on magic, intentionality, and
ethics in the first chapter of this book. Like any other form
of power, magic can be misused and mishandled, and it can
also blow up in your face. Since the magical movements of
nwyfre follow your intentionality, the best way to get good
results is to be sure your intentionality will create a world
you can live with over the long term.
Several useful guidelines can help you do this more
effectively. First, before you perform a working, be careful
in choosing the goal you hope to achieve.You should be able
to express it clearly in a word, a phrase, or at most a single
short sentence, without the least bit of ambiguity. Like the
man in the joke who told the genie, “Make me a milkshake,”


and got turned into a milkshake, those who express their
intentions in magic sloppily often get results they neither
want nor expect.
When choosing an intention for magic, it is important to
be sure that what you intend is actually what you want. It is
equally important to aim for your goal, not for something you
think will get you to your goal. Plenty of people who have no
idea they practice magic fall into the trap of pursuing means
rather than ends, and get what they ask for but not what they
actually want. If you want self-respect but your intention fo-
cuses on money, or you want love but your intention focuses
on getting a particular person’s sexual favors, or you want a
meaningful life but your intention focuses on success symbols,
you’re going to be disappointed, because you’ll get the thing
you ask for rather than the thing you really want.
For this reason,before you perform a magical working,
it’s wise to meditate on it at least three times. Use your in-
tention as the theme for these meditations.As you explore
it, think about what your intention will mean to you when
you achieve it. Turn a cold eye on your fantasies, whatever
those happen to be,and seek a sense of the real effects of the
change you want in your life. If you end up deciding that
your intention isn’t what you want, scrap it and work out
something better.
Another essential step is casting a divination before you
perform any working.Your question should be along the lines
of, “What do I most need to understand about the magical
working I am considering?” The simple three-few reading
given in chapter 3 (Figure 3-3) can be used for this purpose,
with the first few standing for the situation, the second for
the working you have in mind, and the third for the results.
Pay careful attention to the results you get, and let yourself

**_126_** Part Two: The Practice of Druid Magic


be guided by it. If you get an unfavorable reading, don’t
ignore it and go blindly ahead anyway!
Once you have done these preliminary steps, proceed to
the magical work.Two examples show how this kind of work
can be done. Experiment with both of them, and then work
out your own variations on the Sphere of Protection ritual.

**Transforming Yourself**
One of the classic applications of the Sphere ritual focuses on
making changes in yourself by invoking desired qualities and
banishing unwanted ones. You can do this in a general way,
invoking four qualities and banishing four others,or you can
do it in a more tightly focused way, invoking a single quality
and banishing its opposite.
Howdoes this work? If you’re using the general ap-
proach, start by choosing one quality you want to develop in
yourself, and one quality you wish you had less of, for each
of the four material elements. For example, you might de-
cide that as a mage in training, you need more of air’s quick-
ness of mind, fire’s strength of will, water’s desire to learn,
and earth’s patience.You might equally decide that you need
less of air’s wandering thoughts, fire’s irritability, water’s
depressed moods, and earth’s laziness. You would explore
these concepts in meditation, decide that the changes you
have named are right for you, and then perform a divination
to make sure your intention is in tune with the cosmos.
When you perform your Sphere of Protection each day,
then,invoke the quality you want to increase in yourself
while working with each element, and banish the quality you
want to decrease. For example, when you go to the east and
trace the symbol of air, you might say words like these: “By

The Grove of the Druids **_127_**


the hawk of May in the heights of heaven, and in the great
name Hu, I invoke the air, its gods, its spirits and its powers.
May the powers of air bless me with quickness of mind.”
Imagine the yellow nwyfre of air sweeping into you, setting
your mind into swift and nimble motion. Then thank the
powers of air, trace the air symbol counterclockwise, and say
words like these: “And with the help of the powers of air, I
banish from within and around me all wandering thoughts. I
banish them far away from me.” Pause, and imagine that your
mind’s habit of wandering is swept away by the winds and
loses itself in the vastness of air.
Do the same thing to the south, west, and north, invok-
ing and banishing the qualities of the other elements. When
you complete the circle, invoke Spirit Below, concentrate on
all of the changes you want to make in yourself. As you trace
the circle of Spirit,say words like these: “By the bright heart
of the Earth Mother, and in the great name Ced, I invoke
Spirit Below,its gods,its spirits, and its powers. May the po-
wers of Spirit Below strengthen quickness of mind, strength
of will, desire to learn, and patience in me, and may they
assist me to release wandering thoughts,irritability,de-
pressed moods, and laziness from myself and my life.”
Concentrate on the orange nwyfre of Spirit Below flowing
into you from above and feel the changes you have willed
taking place in you, and then thank Spirit Below in your own
words. Do the same thing, changing the words and colored
nwyfre as needed, for Spirit Above and Spirit Within, and
close with the Circulation of Light as usual.
If you want to use the more focused approach,simply
adapt the general approach by invoking the same quality in
each of the directions, and banishing its opposite. For exam-
ple,if you find that old fears from childhood are hindering

**_128_** Part Two: The Practice of Druid Magic


your life more than anything else, you might choose to invoke
courage and banish fear in each of the four directions, and call
on the three forms of Spirit to seal the transformation.
Before using either approach, meditation is an essential
preparation, and not only because you want to be careful be-
fore invoking changes in yourself. The more clearly you un-
derstand the changes you have in mind, the stronger and more
exact your intention will be and the better the results of the
ritual.This is especially important with the more focused
approach, since you need to understand how the quality you
invoke relates to each of the four material elements.
If you choose the second example, for instance, you will
find that each element has its own mode of courage. Air
brings the courage of clarity that shrinks fears down to size;
fire brings the courage of will that overwhelms all resist-
ance;water brings the courage of joy that laughs in the face
of danger; earth brings the courage of persistence that moves
steadily ahead despite all opposition. Each mode of courage
also has its corresponding mode of fear. The better you un-
derstand these details, and the more you bring that under-
standing into the ritual,the better the results will be.
Another important magical principle comes into play
once you finish the ritual. As soon as possible after you fin-
ish the working, take some practical step toward the fulfill-
ment of your intention. The action you choose can be very
small. For example, if you do the focused working to bring
courage and banish fear, choose something that frightens you
just a little,and do it.Pay attention to your emotional reac-
tions to the thing you choose, but do it anyway.This grounds
the effects of the working in your ordinary surroundings and
helps the patterns you have established in nwyfre affect the
material world.

The Grove of the Druids **_129_**


Whether you choose the more general or the more
focused approach, perform the Sphere of Protection ritual
with the same focus at least seven times, and keep track of
the results in your Druid journal. This is a potent technique
and you may be surprised by how quickly the results start
showing up in your life.

**Transforming the World**
The same approach can also be used to bring about changes
in the world around you.This requires greater care, since the
ethical issues are usually more intense, and it also requires
more effort, since changing things outside yourself means you
have to shape the flow of much larger patterns of nwyfre. For
both these reasons, among others, it’s wise to meditate thor-
oughly on any such project before you attempt it. It also helps
to try for fairly modest results at first, and work up to larger
projects once you get experience with the method.
The method is exactly the same as the more focused
method for personal transformation just given. As with any
other magical working,you need to choose your intention
carefully, so you can state it in a single word, phrase, or short
sentence.When you complete the Elemental Cross and go to
the east to invoke air, change the wording of the invocation
to ask the powers of air to accomplish your intention, stat-
ing it aloud. When you banish, banish every influence that
might hinder your intention. Do the same thing in the other
three quarters.When you return to the center, invoke Spirit
in its three forms to confirmthe accomplishment of your
intention.
For example, if you need access to an old book of Druid
lore that is out of print and unavailable to you, you would

**_130_** Part Two: The Practice of Druid Magic


start by meditating on that intention several times, making
sure your intention is ethical and that you can ask for exactly
what you want. You might end up stating your intention as
“A copy of Ross Nichols’ book _The Cosmic Shape_ comes to
me.” You would then cast a divination to be sure the work-
ing is a good idea. If so, in your next Sphere of Protection
working, when you invoke the element of air, you would use
words such as these: “By the hawk of May in the heights of
morning, and in the great name Hu, I invoke the air, its gods,
its spirits, and its powers.With the help of the powers of air,
a copy of Ross Nichols’ book _The Cosmic Shape_ comes to me.”
You would then imagine the book coming to you,
brought by the winds and the spirits of the air, and then
thank the air in your own words. As you trace the banishing
version of the symbol of air, say words such as these: “And
with the help of the powers of air,I banish every influence
that might hinder my intention. I banish it far away from
me.” Imagine that every obstacle that keeps you from getting
the book dissolves like mist. Proceed to the south and
around the circle as usual, repeating words of the same type
in each quarter,changing them to suit the element of that
quarter.
When you complete the circle and invoke Spirit Below,
trace the circle of Spirit and say words such as these: “By the
bright heart of the Earth Mother, and in the great name Ced,
I invoke Spirit Below, its gods, its spirits and its powers. May
the powers of Spirit Below guide the elements in their work,
so that a copy of Ross Nichols’book _The Cosmic Shape_ comes
to me.” As you say this, imagine the book resting in your
hands. See it in your mind’s eye as clearly as possible; imag-
ine the weight of the book, the texture of its paper dust jacket,
the scent of old book paper.

The Grove of the Druids **_131_**


Concentrate on the image of the book resting in your
hands; let go of everything else for the moment. Remem-
ber, you’re not trying to force the universe to do what you
want; you’re simply formulating a pattern into which cur-
rents of nwyfre will flow. When you are ready, release the
image entirely and go on with the ritual. Do the same thing
when you invoke Spirit Above and Spirit Within. When you
do the Circulation of Light, imagine that the spinning spheres
of light set the world into motion around you, sending your
intention out to the edges of the universe. Once again, after
you finish the ritual, take some practical step toward bring-
ing about your intention—to continue the example, you
might go onto the Internet and do a book search for _The
Cosmic Shape._ Keep track of the results in your Druid journal.

**The Grove Ceremony**
The Sphere of Protection is a complete ritual in its own
right, but it also forms one part of a more extensive ritual,
the grove ceremony. This ceremony is the key to the more
advanced dimensions of this book’s magical work, and
should be studied, practiced, and mastered as soon as you
can do the Sphere of Protection effectively from memory.
In eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Druidry, a grove
was a local group of Druids who held regular meetings with
ritual openings and closings. _Grove,_ in Druid parlance, in other
words, meant much the same thing that _lodge_ means among
Freemasons. It still has this meaning, but during the develop-
ment of Druid magic in the twentieth century,Druids of
several traditions realized that the same ritual used to open
and close a grove could also be done by a Druid working
alone,as a way of opening and closing magical ceremonies.

**_132_** Part Two: The Practice of Druid Magic


Used in this way, these rituals perform the essential tasks of
establishing magical space and time at the beginning of a
working, and returning the mage to ordinary space and time
at the working’s end.
Grove ceremonies from many different Druid traditions
can be used for this purpose—I have used half a dozen from
time to time with good effect—but most traditions keep
their grove rituals private and only communicate them to
initiates. The Ancient Order of Druids in America (AODA),
by contrast, makes the complete text of its grove ritual pub-
lic. For this reason among others, the AODA grove opening
and closing is used here. Still, if you are an initiate of another
Druid order and like to use its grove ritual as a solitary prac-
tice, you can use all the magical methods in this book within
the framework of that ritual, too.

**_Opening the Grove_**
Before you start the opening ritual, you need to gather every-
thing required and put it in its proper place.The requirements
for the grove ritual, and for the workings that will take place
in an open grove,are fairly simple.You’ll need something to
serve as an altar—a small end table or folding TV tray will do
fine—a white altar cloth,and a chair suitable for meditation.
You’ll also need four bowls or small cauldrons.They will
all need to fit on top of the altar at the same time, and leave
room for other ritual needs and equipment, so “small” is the
operative word. Two of them will be filled halfway with dry
sand;one of these will be used for incense,and the other for
a votive candle or tea light. The third will be half-full of
water, and the last one will be half-full of salt or clean earth.
They represent the four material elements and play an im-
portant role in the ritual.

The Grove of the Druids **_133_**


Finally, you’ll need to decide what you want to do about
garments. A plain white robe and _nemyss_ —this latter is a
vaguely Egyptian headcloth that is tied around the head and
falls down over the shoulders, as shown in Figure 5-1—has
long been standard ritual wear in the Druid Revival tradition,
but it’s also a central theme in modern Druidry that each
Druid has the right to make his or her own choices. Some
Druid mages wear the classic white robe and nemyss; others
wear some other sort of ritual garments; still others do magic
in their street clothes or wearing nothing at all. Make your own
decision depending on your circumstances and preferences.
To prepare the space, set up the altar in the center, put
the altar cloth over it, and put the cauldron of incense on it
toward the east side. The cauldron of fire goes to the south,
the cauldron of water to the west, and the cauldron of salt to

the north, as shown in Figure 5-2. The chair goes to the
north, facing south toward the altar, with enough space
between them so that you can pass through readily. When
you’ve learned the grove ritual and are using it for magical
workings, any additional tools or materials go on the altar as
well. Just before you begin, put a stick or cone of incense in
the incense cauldron and light it, and light the candle or tea
lamp in the cauldron of fire. That completes the preparation
of the space.
Before you begin, take a few moments to clear your
mind of unrelated thoughts and feelings.Then, when you are
ready to begin, enter the circle and walk in a clockwise cir-
cle to the north side of the altar,between the altar and the
chair, where you face south. Raise your right hand palm for-
ward to salute the Sun, which is always symbolically at high
noon in the southern sky.Visualize it there, shining down its
rays of power and blessing on you and the entire world.
Say aloud, “Let the powers be present as I am about to
open a grove of Druids in this place.The first duty of a Druid
in the Sacred Grove is to proclaim peace to the four quarters
of the world,for without peace my work cannot proceed.”

Circle around to the east. Face outward and raise your
right hand palm outward to salute the direction. Say, “I pro-
claim peace in the east.” As you do this, imagine peace enfold-
ing the whole quarter of the world to the east of you. At the
same time, be aware of your mind and thoughts, and still
them, so that peace is present in the symbolic east of yourself.
Proceed to the south and make the same gesture, saying,
“I proclaim peace in the south.” Imagine peace spreading
across the southern quarter of the world. At the same time,
be aware of your passions and desires, and still them, estab-
lishing peace in the symbolic south of yourself.
Proceed to the west, and do the same thing, saying, “I
proclaim peace in the west.” Imagine peace spreading over
the western quarter of the world. At the same time, be
aware of your feelings and emotions, and still them, making
peace in the symbolic west of yourself.
Proceed to the north and do the same thing, saying, “I pro-
claim peace in the north.”Imagine peace spreading across
the northern quarter of the world. At the same time, be
aware of your physical senses, and still them, so that peace
comes to the symbolic north of yourself.
Return to the north side of the altar, facing south as you
were at the beginning of the ritual, and say, “The four quar-
ters are at peace and the work of the grove may proceed. Let
this grove and all within it be purified with air.”
Go to the eastern side of the altar, pick up the cauldron
with the incense in both hands. Imagine that it is surrounded
with a sphere of brilliant yellow light. Carry it to the eastern
edge of the space.Walk in a clockwise circle once around the
outer edge of the space, from east to east, and as you do, imag-
ine the sphere of yellow light tracing a luminous circle that

**_136_** Part Two: The Practice of Druid Magic


surrounds and protects the entire grove. Feel the winds of
heaven rushing around the circle as you go. When you come
back around to the east, return the cauldron to the altar.
Next, say, “Let this grove and all within it be purified
with fire.” Pick up the cauldron with the lamp, imagining
that it is surrounded by a sphere of brilliant red light. Take it
to the southern edge of the space and go once around clock-
wise from south to south, tracing a circle of red light that
surrounds and protects the grove. Imagine that flames rise
and sweep around the circle as you go. When you’ve come
back around to the south, return the cauldron to the altar.
Next, say, “Let this grove and all within it be purified with
water.” Pick up the cauldron with the water, imagining that it
is surrounded with a sphere of brilliant blue light. Take it to
the western edge of the space and go once around clockwise
from west to west,tracing a circle of blue light that surrounds
and protects the grove. Imagine that waves of water rush
around the circle as you go. When you’ve come back around
to the west, return the cauldron to the altar.
Next, say, “Let this grove and all within it be purified
with earth.”Pick up the cauldron with the salt or earth,
imagining that it is surrounded with a sphere of brilliant
green light. Take it to the northern edge of the space and go
once around clockwise from north to north, tracing a circle
of green light that surrounds and protects the grove. Imagine
that a grove of mighty trees springs up around the circle as
you go.When you’ve come back around to the north, return
the cauldron to the altar.
Standing at the north of the altar, facing south, say, “I
invoke the blessing of the Mighty Ones with the words that
have been the bond among all Druids:

The Grove of the Druids **_137_**


```
Grant, O holy ones, thy protection;
And in protection, strength;
And in strength, understanding;
And in understanding, knowledge;
And in knowledge, the knowledge of justice;
And in the knowledge of justice, the love of it;
And in that love, the love of all existences;
And in the love of all existences, the love of Earth our
mother and all goodness.
```
When you’ve finished the prayer, chant the word _Awen_
three times. Draw the word out into its three syllables—
“Ah-Oh-En”—and let it resonate throughout your body and
the grove.
Pause for a moment, then perform the complete Sphere
of Protection ritual.Ineach of the seven invocations, ask the
powers of the elements to bless and protect the grove, and
in each of the banishings, banish any influence that might
hinder the grove and its work. In the east, for example, you
might invoke with words like these: “By the hawk of May in
the heights of morning, and in the great name Hu, I invoke
the air, its gods, its spirits, and its powers. May the powers
of air bless and protect this grove and all within it, and grant
their aid its work.” You might banish with words like these:
“And with the help of the powers of air, I banish from within
and around this grove every influence that might hinder its
work.I banish all such influences far away.”When you do the
Circulation of Light, finally, expand the whirling sphere of
light far enough that it surrounds the entire working space.
When you are finished doing the Sphere of Protection,
go to the chair and sit down. This act completes the opening
half of the ceremony.

**_138_** Part Two: The Practice of Druid Magic


**_Closing the Grove_**
When the work of the grove is finished, return to the chair,
sit down, and let your mind return to stillness.When you’re
ready, rise and go to the north side of the altar, facing south
across it as at the beginning. Say, “Let the powers be present
as I am about to close a grove of Druids in this place. Peace
prevails in the four quarters and throughout the grove. Let
any power remaining from this working be returned to the
Earth for its blessing.”
This is a crucial step,and takes practice.Any magical
working leaves some nwyfre behind it, and this needs to be
earthed out so it doesn’t affect others or manifest in your life
in unwanted ways. Feel the energy of the working around
you, and then imagine it flowing inward toward the altar,
down through it into the Earth, and then down to the Earth’s
center. Keep concentrating on this until the ritual space feels
clear of any leftover nwyfre.
Next, say, “I now invoke the Sword of Swords.” Pause,
and imagine that a great sword rises through the altar, hilt
first, as though through the surface of a lake. The blade is of
blue steel that shimmers with a light like Sun on water, the
hilt is of brilliant gold,and the pommel at the upper end of
the hilt is a jewel that shimmers and flashes in rainbow col-
ors. The sword rises until it has cleared the altar and hovers
in the air, its point just above the altar’s surface. Repeat the
following invocation of the Sword of Swords:

```
From the rising Sun, three rays of light;
From the living earth, three stones of witness;
From the eye and mind and hand of wisdom,
Three rowan staves of all knowledge.
From the fire of the Sun, the forge;
```
The Grove of the Druids **_139_**


```
From the bones of the earth, the steel;
From the hand of the wise, the shaping:
From these, Excalibur.
```
Raise your right hand in salute, and imagine yourself
placing your palm against the flat of the blade, as knights once
did when swearing fealty. Say, “By the Sword of Swords, I
pledge my faithful service to the living Earth our home and
mother.Awen.”
Chant the word _Awen_ in three syllables, “Ah-Oh-En,” draw-
ingeach one out.As you do, see the image of the sword dis-
solve into brilliant light and disappear. You are left standing
before the altar, your hand raised in salute to the Sun in the
south.Lower your hand,leave the altar, walk in a clockwise
circle around the space, and then continue around to the exit
and leave the grove. This completes the closing half of the
ceremony.

**Working Magic in the Grove**
What you can do between the opening and closing halves of
the grove ceremony is limited only by your imagination and
your understanding of magic.To begin with, practice the
two halves of the ceremony until you can do both from
memory. Until you can get by without a written copy of the
ceremony, its deeper dimensions are out of reach, and tak-
ing the step to serious magical practice should be postponed.
Once you can do the grove opening and closing smoothly
from memory, you can begin working magic within the sacred
space established by the grove ceremony. The magical tech-
niques you’ve already learned provide the basic toolkit for
this work.

**_140_** Part Two: The Practice of Druid Magic


**_First Method_**
To begin with, the method for doing practical work with the
Sphere of Protection ritual gains a good deal of magical force
when done in an open grove. Simply change the invocations
and banishings of the Sphere ritual in the opening ceremony
as needed to suit your intention.This is a simple but complete
form of ritual working, and, with practice, it can easily have
effects as potent as much more complex ceremonies.
For example, if your intention is to use magic to develop
your abilities as an artist,you would do the usual preliminar-
ies of meditating on the intention and casting an Ogham
reading to be sure the working is appropriate.You might then
begin with the grove opening, proclaiming peace to the four
quarters, purifying the grove with the four material elements,
and invoking the gods with the Druid Prayer, and beginning
the Sphere of Protection with your usual Elemental Cross.
When you invoke in the east, though, use words that call on
the powers of air to help you develop your artistic abilities,
and when you banish,banish all obstacles to the free expres-
sion of your artistic vision.
Proceed to the other six elements and express your inten-
tion in the same way.Do the Circulation of Light as usual,and
then take your seat in the grove. Spend several minutes con-
centrating on your intention, not as something you want to
achieve in your future, but as though you have it at that
moment; feel creative power flowing through you, trem-
bling at your fingertips, demanding to be expressed. Begin
the closing ritual while this feeling is still strong in you, and
close in the usual way. As soon as possible after finishing, take
some practical step toward the fulfillment of your inten-
tion—for example, you might get out your art supplies and
start work on a new drawing, painting, or sculpture.

The Grove of the Druids **_141_**


**_Second Method_**
When you have done several workings of this sort and know
your way around the method, the next step is to integrate the
simple magical workings introduced in chapter 4. The active
workings for air, water, fire, and earth can all be used in this
way. Start with anything you need—a glass of water, the mate-
rial for a magical fire, or a stone—at the center of the altar.
Perform the opening half of the grove ritual as usual, putting
your intention into the invocations and banishings of the
Sphere of Protection ritual,as in the first method described.
Take your seat in the grove and concentrate on your in-
tention. Imagine the nwyfre charged with your intention as
colored light filling the grove, using the color symbolism
that was presented in Table 4-1. At this point, go on to the
active working you have chosen: breathe the color into your
body, concentrate it in the water or the stone, or light the
magical fire and gaze into the flames. When you have fin-
ished,spend some time concentrating on your intention as
something completed,and then proceed to the closing half
of the ceremony.
If you decide to use this second method with the same
intention as the first,for example,after meditating on your
intention and casting an Ogham reading to be sure the work-
ing is appropriate, you would make the usual preparations
for a grove ritual, and you might place a glass or goblet half-
full of pure water in the middle of the altar.You would open
in the same way, and use similar words in the Sphere of
Protection.
As you finish opening the grove, though, you might
imagine the nwyfre summoned by the Sphere of Protection
as purple light filling the entire space. Take your seat in the
grove, and pay attention to the nwyfre you have summoned,

**_142_** Part Two: The Practice of Druid Magic


then imagine it moving inward to the center of the grove and
flowing into the water. Using your imagination, press the
purple light inward, into the water, until it has been com-
pletely absorbed and the water is practically fizzing with
nwyfre. Rise and take up the glass in both hands, clear your
mind completely, and then drink the water.
Return to your seat in the grove, sit down, and spend
some time concentrating on your intention, not as some-
thing you hope to achieve but as though you have already
achieved it.When you are ready, begin the closing half of the
grove ceremony, and close in the usual way. As before, take
some practical step toward the fulfillment of your intention
as soon as possible after you finish the working.

**The Art of Scrying**
Another use for the grove ceremony is as a starting point for
inner journeys,using the imagination as a gateway. Distrust
and fear of imagination is so deeply rooted in modern cul-
ture that many people dismiss such journeys as empty make-
believe, and others who reject this prejudice react by putting
too much emphasis on imaginative experience. These two
extremes define a binary,of course,and the third factor de-
fines an important branch of magical work.
The word _scrying_ is an old term for “seeing,” and still gets
some play in modern English in the form _descry,_ meaning “to
see at a distance.” In magical circles, though, it long ago
turned into a word for a kind of seeing that does not rely on
the physical eyes. Like so many magical techniques, scrying
is something everyone does all the time without noticing it.
Mages simply noticed this, learned to do it consciously, and
put it to work.

The Grove of the Druids **_143_**


Scrying, in fact, is nothing more than the art of seeing
with the imagination. Take a few moments right now to im-
agine something—a weathered gray standing stone, let’s say,
with grass around its base and patches of white lichen grow-
ing on it here and there.You don’t have to “see it” as though
it’s physically in front of you. Simply let the image rise in
your mind’s eye, and see what your imagination adds to it.
As you look at the stone, what lies beyond it? What is the
weather and the time of day? Is the wind blowing, and if so,
from what direction? Don’t try to reason these questions
out, or force the image to go one way or another; simply let
your imagination play, and see what it shows you.
If you took the time to do that just now, you have just
had your first scrying experience. It really is that simple!
Mages usually practice scrying in a ritual or meditative set-
ting,however, in order to focus the inner eye of scrying
more intently on a chosen subject. The grove ceremony
offers an effective framework for doing this,and seven imag-
inal spaces—the realms beyond the Seven Gates—as desti-
nations for your first imaginal journeys.
Start by setting up the grove in the usual way, except that
the chair is placed so that it faces across the altar toward the
direction of the element you intend to scry—for example, the
chair will be in the west facing east to scry air, and in the south
facing north to scry fire. (Leave it in the north to scry the
three forms of Spirit.) Open the grove as usual, with the stan-
dard grove ceremony version of the Sphere of Protection.
Take your seat, and go through the same process you would
use to begin a meditation:relaxation,followed by the cleans-
ing breath, followed by five minutes or so of rhythmic breath-
ing. Do this as color breathing, using the color of the gate you
plan to enter,to begin attuning yourself to its energies.

**_144_** Part Two: The Practice of Druid Magic


When you have finished the period of rhythmic breath,
imagine that a circle of great trees surrounds the grove. Just
within the circle of trees, the symbols of the elements hover
in the air, brightly colored. Beneath you is the rich warm
earth of the forest floor, marked with the orange circle of
Spirit Below, and the sky and the purple circle of Spirit
Above are overhead. Hear the wind in the branches and the
calls of birds, and smell the scent of leaves and earth and fresh
forest air.This is the Inner Grove, your sanctuary and place of
Druid magic in the imaginal world.You will be returning to
it at the beginning and end of each of your imaginal journeys,
so take the time to imagine it richly and strongly.
Then imagine yourself rising to your feet and going to
the center of the Inner Grove. Face the symbol of which-
ever element you have chosen to scry. Imagine it expanding
until it is large enough for you to walk through.You see that
it has become a portal, opening onto another realm of exis-
tence. At this point, pass through the portal into the elemen-
tal realm beyond.
The first time you do this, stop just inside the portal and
simply look around.Let images rise in your mind the way
they did when you imagined the standing stone. What does
the realm of the element look like? What sounds, scents, and
other perceptions come to you? Are there animals or other
living things of any sort visible? If so, what do they look like,
and what are they doing? Do they approach you or speak to
you, and if the latter, what do they say?
When you have seen as much as you wish, or as much as
the element appears to be willing to show you, go back
through the portal into the Inner Grove. Face the symbol of
the realm you just left, and imagine it shrinking back to its
normal size. Return to the chair where your physical body is

The Grove of the Druids **_145_**


sitting, and sit down. Then allow the imagery of the Inner
Grove to fade from your mind, stand up, and perform the
closing half of the grove ceremony.
Afterward, make detailed notes on your scrying experi-
ences in your Druid journal. Over the next few days, devote
several sessions of meditation at least to the images, ideas,
and events you experienced in your scrying. As imaginal ex-
periences, these things will likely be packed with symbolic
meanings that must be unpacked through meditation. Take
your time, work through the experiences of the scrying one
at a time, and finish the process before you do another scry-
ing.You will find, as generations of mages have found before
you, that one scrying opened up in meditation and tho-
roughly understood is worth twenty left unexplored.

**_The Uses of Scrying_**
It’s best to scry each of the elements once to begin with,
starting with air and going on in the same order you used to
learn the invocations and banishings of the Gates. Each of
these scryings is done the same way except for the last.
When you scry Spirit Within,you don’t need to get up out
of your chair and face a portal; you yourself are the portal to
Spirit Within. Instead, imagine yourself sitting in the same
place as your material body. Let your imaginal self shrink
and descend into your material body. Within your body, you
find the inner landscape of your own microcosm. See what
you find there, and when you are ready to return, imagine
yourself expanding upward and outward until your imaginal
body and your material body fill the same space, and then
allow the imaginal body to fade from your mind’s eye.
Once you’ve scried each of the seven elements once, you
can scry them again in whatever order seems best to you. It’s

**_146_** Part Two: The Practice of Druid Magic


wise not to spend too much time on a single element, or
neglect one of the elements completely, since scrying the ele-
ments will attune you to elemental forces and a scattershot
approach risks imbalance. Still, this is one of the many dimen-
sions of magical work where the personal equation is para-
mount. If you come to realize that you relate very poorly to
one of the elements, doing a series of scryings of that element
can be an effective way to bring yourself more into balance.
As you explore the elemental realms through scrying,
you will find that the imaginal beings who inhabit them
provide crucial dimensions of the experience. The modern
world’s materialist philosophy insists that such beings are “all
in your imagination,” but you’ll find that the imaginal beings
you encounter in scrying know things you don’t, and behave
in ways you can neither predict nor control. Treat them as
real beings,with purposes and desires of their own,and
you’ll learn the most from them.
You can ask these beings, for example, to guide you in
your journeys through the elemental realms. A good way to
do this is to trace the elemental symbol clockwise, the
invoking direction,and say words like this:“By the powers of
[name of element] I ask for a faithful guide in this elemental
realm.” If a spirit approaches you, ask it to trace the same
elemental symbol in the air.If it passes this test, you may
safely accept its guidance. After it has shown you as much of
the elemental realm as it chooses, ask it to take you back to
your starting place, and when it does, trace the elemental
symbol counterclockwise and say words like these:“By the
powers of [element] I thank you. May the blessing of [ele-
ment] always be with you.” Then close the scrying as usual.
Magical lore gives many names to the beings of the ele-
mental realms. One useful set comes from Welsh faery lore,

The Grove of the Druids **_147_**


which fuses Celtic and medieval magical traditions. The
beings met beyond the Gate of the East are the _Tylwyth Teg_
(pronounced “TUH-loo-uth TEG”), the light-elves; they
wear red garments and teach magic to those who please
them.The beings beyond the Gate of the West are the _Ellyllon_
(pronounced “ELH-ulh-on”), the forest elves; they wear
white garments, and will share wilderness lore and the
secrets of herbs to those who earn their trust. The beings
beyond the Gate of the South are the _Coblynau_ (pronounced
“KOB-luh-nye”), the dwarves, dwellers in mines and moun-
tains who dress in drab colors. They have all the secrets of
craftsmanship in their keeping, and will communicate these
to apt pupils. The beings beyond the Gate of the North are
the _Bwbachod_ (pronounced “BOO-bakh-od”), the spirits of
houses and fields; they wear brown garments, and teach the
arts of farming and housekeeping to those who are diligent
and patient.
The three realms of Spirit are inhabited by more power-
ful beings, the three great families of Welsh myth.The realm
of Spirit Above is the home of the Plant Don (pronounced
“plohnt DONN”),the children of the goddess Don.In the
last age of the world they were ruled by Math son of
Mathonwy; their rulers in this age of the world are Gwydion
(pronounced “GWI-dee-on”) son of Don—in Welsh,
Gwydion ap Don—and his sister Arianrhod (pronounced
“ah-ree-ANN-rhod”) daughter of Don—in Welsh, Arianrhod
ferch Ddon (pronounced “verkh THON”).The Plant Don are
the regents of the Sun, the Star Logoi of Western occult tra-
dition,and Welsh folklore assigns them homes among the
stars. Even today, the Welsh call the Milky Way Caer Wydion,
the Castle of Gwydion, or Caer Arianrhod, the Castle of
Arianrhod.Some of the lore of the Plant Don may be found
in the fourth branch of the _Mabinogion._

**_148_** Part Two: The Practice of Druid Magic


The realm of Spirit Below is the home of the Plant Annwn
(pronounced “plohnt ANN-oon”), the children of Annwn, the
realm of the dead and also the source of all life. In the last age
of the world they were ruled by Arawn; their rulers in this
age of the world are Gwyn ap Nudd (pronounced “GWUN
app NEETH”) and his wife Creiddylad ferch Ludd (pro-
nounced “CREY-thu-lad verkh LEETH”). In Welsh tradition,
lakes are gateways to Annwn, and maidens called _Gwragedd
Annwn_ (pronounced goo-RAG-eth ANN-oon”), “women of
Annwn,” are said to come from beneath the waters of lakes
bearing strange gifts. The Lady of the Lake in Arthurian leg-
end, who gave Arthur the magical sword Excalibur, was one
of these.Some of the lore of the Plant Annwn can be found
in the first branch of the _Mabinogion._
The realm of Spirit Within is the home of the Plant Llyr
(pronounced “plohnt LHUR”),the children of the god Llyr.
In the last age of the world they were ruled by Bran ap Llyr,
called Bran the Blessed; their rulers in this age of the world
are Manawyddan ap Llyr (pronounced “man-a-WUTH-ann
app LHUR”) and his wife Rhiannon ferch Hefeydd Hen
(pronounced “rhee-ANN-on verkh HEV-eyth HEN”).The
Plant Llyr are the archetypal forms of humanity, and their
struggles, triumphs, and tragedies echo the fundamental pat-
terns of human existence;they also represent particular
energies within the human body that can be encountered
and awakened by a variety of magical practices. Some of the
lore of the Plant Llyr can be found in the second and third
branches of the _Mabinogion._
These beings should be approached carefully and with
due respect. Strictly speaking, they are not elemental beings
at all, but belong to the class of mighty spirits that different
traditions call angels, intelligences, or devas.Very often they
test newcomers to their realms before revealing any of their

The Grove of the Druids **_149_**


secrets, and the tests are not always obvious ones.Those who
pass their tests and earn their regard, though, can receive
magical teachings of great power. The Plant Don and Plant
Annwn govern the two great currents of energy that shape
the cosmos of Druid magic, and the Plant Llyr govern the
energies of the human body—the alchemical vessel where
these two currents fuse to create the lunar current, the cre-
ative power of Awen.

**Awakening the Two Currents**
A final dimension of work that can be done within the sacred
space established by the grove ritual focuses on these currents.
The solar,telluric, and lunar currents are much more than
mere theoretical factors in Druid magic. Magical workings can
summon the first two and create the third.Your body, the por-
tal of Spirit Within, provides the context where this work takes
place first; once you have accomplished it within your body,
the same dance of nwyfre can then be set in motion in wider
circles around you until it encompasses the whole world.
These workings—the active workings for Spirit Below,
Above, and Within—are at least potentially much more
intensive than any of the earlier rituals in this book, and so
require more careful preparation. Before you start planning,
cast an Ogham reading to make sure you are ready, just as
you would if you were performing any other ritual working.
If you get an unfavorable reading, keep working with the
practices covered in earlier sections of this book for at least
two weeks before you try again.This is a serious step, and it
should not be rushed.
Once your Ogham sticks or cards tell you that you are
ready to proceed, schedule your invocation of the telluric
current at least a week in the future. It should be performed

**_150_** Part Two: The Practice of Druid Magic


at the time of Dewaint, between midnight and 3:00 AM,
when the telluric current is strongest. Choose a night when
you can perform the ritual during this time without any risk
of interruption. Schedule your invocation of the solar cur-
rent at least a week later, during the time of Nawn, between
noon and 3:00 PM—this is the time when the solar current
is strongest.
Before you perform the ritual to invoke the telluric cur-
rent,spend a week on meditations on Spirit Below. During
these meditations, explore what myth and legend have to say
about the underworld and the presence of spirits below us,
and try to grasp what those mythic symbols are trying to
communicate. Why are the spirits of the dead associated
with _below,_ and not some other direction? You don’t have to
come up with an answer. The important thing is that you
grapple with the questions.
When the night of the working arrives, prepare the
space for an ordinary grove ceremony. Before you begin,
purify your body by washing in cold water. If you can bathe
in a river or stream, this is best, but an ordinary tub will do,
or even a sink and a washcloth.Once you have washed,put
on your ritual garments, light the candle and incense, and
begin the grove ceremony shortly after midnight. Perform
the grove ceremony in the usual way. When you do the
Sphere of Protection, ask each of the elements to help you
make contact with the telluric current, and banish all obsta-
cles to that contact from yourself and the grove. When you
finish opening the grove, take your seat in the north, relax
your body, and spend a few minutes doing color breathing
with orange, the color of Spirit Below.
At this point turn your attention to the land beneath
your feet. Imagine currents of energy flowing up from the
center of the Earth,channeled through veins of metal in the

The Grove of the Druids **_151_**


rocks, surging up through the roots of trees, bringing vital-
ity to all living things. Feel yourself as part of the biosphere,
one small manifestation of the life force of the planet.
Rise to your feet and go to the north of the altar, facing
south. Trace the heather pentagram over the altar, starting
from the bottom point and going clockwise, as shown in
Figure 5-3. As you do this, imagine the pentagram as though
your fingers were drawing it in the air. There are at least
three ways to handle this imagery. You can see the lines of
the pentagram drawn in orange light, like the elemental
emblems in the Sphere of Protection. You can also draw on
Ogham symbolism and see them as five straight heather
boughs interwoven in the form of a pentagram.
Finally, you can take the Ogham symbolism one step fur-
ther and include the Ogham trees pointed out by the other
four points of the pentagram.Look at the picture of the
heather pentagram on the dolmen arch in Figure 2-5. The
bottom point touches _U_ for Ur,the heather,but the other
points have trees of their own: Huath the hawthorn, Ngetal
the reed, Luis the rowan, and Tinne the holly, in order

**Figure 5-3 Tracing the Heather Pentagram**

**_152_** Part Two: The Practice of Druid Magic

```

```
Invoking Banishing
```

clockwise around the pentagram. To include all of these,
imagine a straight heather bough extending from the bottom
point to the upper left point, a hawthorn branch going from
there to the right, a reed straight across from right to left, a
rowan bough going from the left hand point to the upper
right point, and a branch of holly slanting down from the
upper right point to the bottom point. Of course, you need
to know what all five of these look like! This is the strongest
formof the heather pentagram, because each of the Ogham
trees of this pentagram also belongs to the telluric current,
and their symbolism helps bring it through in a more com-
plete form.
Once you have traced the pentagram, imagine the cur-
rent of life force from within the Earth surging up into the
grove like cool water from a spring. Feel its invigorating and
vitalizing power.Breathe it into yourself with each inbreath
until every cell of your body is singing with the sheer joy of
being alive. Concentrate on this as intently as possible for as
long as you can.
When you are ready to close, trace the heather penta-
gram in reverse,starting from the bottom point and going
counterclockwise. Imagine your fingers erasing the imagery
you established when you drew the invoking form, whether
that took the formof orange light, heather branches, or the
five Ogham trees of the pentagram. Then sit down again in
the north, relax your body, and pay attention to your breath
for a few moments before closing.
After you have completed this ritual,prepare for the
corresponding solar ritual. Devote the week before the solar
current invocation to intensive daily meditations, taking the
concept of Spirit descending from above as your theme. In
these meditations, explore why it is that so many spiritual

The Grove of the Druids **_153_**


traditions think of the spiritual as above the material, why
heaven is in the sky and mystics talk of the higher self and
higher levels of being. Why _above,_ and not below, ahead,
beside, beyond, or in some other direction? You need not
come up with an answer to these questions; what matters is
that you wrestle with them, so that the symbolism of the rit-
ual finds resonances in your own inner life.
Begin the ritual after purifying yourself with cold water
and dressing in your ritual garments. Perform the grove cere-
mony in the ordinary way. In the Sphere of Protection, ask the
elements to help you contact the solar current, and banish all
obstacles to that contact from yourself and the grove. When
you finish the opening, sit in the north, relax your body, and
do purple color breathing to attune with Spirit Above.
At this point turn your attention to the Sun high above
you,pouring down its rays on the Earth. Imagine light
descending from the Sun through the vast reaches of outer
space to your grove. Picture the planets in their orbits
receiving the Sun’s light and passing it on again. Sense all of
space filled with the radiance and influence of the Sun.
Rise to your feet and go to the north of the altar,facing
south. Trace the oak pentagram above the altar with the first
two fingers of your right hand, starting with the top point
and going clockwise, as shown in Figure 5-4. As with the
heather pentagram, you can imagine the lines of the oak pen-
tagram as pure purple light, as five branches of oak inter-
woven into a pentagram, or as branches of the five Ogham
trees marked by the points of the pentagram.These are Duir
the oak,Eadha the aspen,Nuin the ash,Gort the ivy,and
Onn the gorse respectively, going clockwise around the pen-
tagram from the top point. This last is the strongest form,
but any of the three may be used with good effect.

**_154_** Part Two: The Practice of Druid Magic


**Figure 5-4 Tracing the Oak Pentagram**

Once you trace and imagine the pentagram, picture in
your mind’s eye a beam of light descending from the Sun to
your grove. Feel its warmth and the clarity it gives to your
mind and imagination. As you breathe in each breath, imag-
ine yourself drawing the light into your body until every cell
is blazing with solar light.Concentrate on this as intently as
possible.
When you are ready toclose,trace the oak pentagram in
reverse, starting from the top point and going counterclock-
wise. Imagine your fingers erasing the imagery you estab-
lished when you drewthe invoking form,whether that took
the form of purple light, oak branches, or the five Ogham
trees of the pentagram. Then sit down again in the north,
relax your body, and pay attention to your breath for a few
moments before you perform the closing.
Once you have done each of these ceremonies once, wait
for at least a month before doing either one again. They can
catalyze powerful changes in yourself and your life, and it’s
wise to let those changes run their course before bringing
more of either current to bear on yourself. In the meantime,
continue your basic practices and, if divination favors it, plan
and perform a working or two for practical purposes, using

the rituals given earlier in this chapter. Once you have estab-
lished contact with the solar and telluric currents, the results
of even simple magical workings may surprise you.

**_156_** Part Two: The Practice of Druid Magic


## Chapter 6 The Art of Enchantment

The magical workings presented so far in this book have used
very little in the way of equipment.This follows a longstand-
ing habit in the Druid Revival community. In the Ancient
Order of Druids in America (AODA),for example, the only
Druid gear any member needs to have, even at the highest
degree of initiation, are a robe, a nemyss, a colored cord
belt, a colored stone, a small cloth or leather bag, a knife, a
cauldron, and a staff or wand. Other traditional Druid orders
have similar ha-bits when it comes to magical hardware.
Compared to many other magical traditions, this is a fairly
sparse toolkit,and next to the splendid Victorian clutter of
nineteenth-century magical orders such as the Hermetic
Order of the Golden Dawn, it may seem quite ascetic.
Still, the art of enchanting tools and other material
objects has an important place in Druid magic. The handful
of working tools Druids use in their magical practices can be
filled with nwyfre and linked to the great currents and cycles
of the cosmos, so that magical work done with the tools
echoes outward into a wider world. The same thing can be
done to the Druid’s own body, enaid, and mind for exactly
the same reasons. Both these steps, in turn, lead to one of
the core dimensions of Druid magic, the use of enchantment


to bring spiritual powers into manifestation throughout the
world of matter—literally, the reenchantment of the world.

**A Circle of Stones**
A basic technique you have already learned offers a good way
tobegin work on the art of enchantment. Back in chapter 4,
you learned how to charge a stone with a magical intention.
This simple method of enchantment has long been taught to
novices in the AODA, but one of its applications links to a
practice common in the Druid community since the late
eighteenth century.
Iolo Morganwg, the innovative Welsh Druid responsible
for most of the basic elements of classic Druid Revival ritual,
established the custom of opening Druid groves inside a stone
circle. When it wasn’t possible to use one of the ancient cir-
cles such as Stonehenge or Avebury, or one of the newly built
ones that his work inspired in Wales and elsewhere, Iolo sim-
ply brought a pocketful of small stones and marked out the
ritual circle with those.The epochal ceremony on London’s
Primrose Hill in 1792 that launched Iolo’s public Druid
career took place within such a circle of stones.
Since then,Druids of many traditions have used this sort
of portable stone circle in their rituals to define and anchor
ritual space. Regular use in Druid ritual will enchant these
stones, so that the simple act of setting them in a circle will be-
gin the process of establishing the grove and awakening its en-
ergies.This process can be quickened, though, by deliberately
enchanting the stones with this intention.The correspon-
dences given in Table 6-1 provide the symbolic framework
for this working.

Start by choosing eight stones, one for each of the
Stations of the Wheel of Life. Any stone that appeals to you,
from plain pebbles to carefully chosen semiprecious stones,
can be used. Wash them in fresh running water to cleanse
them of unwanted nwyfre,and expose them to sunlight for
at least an hour. Once you have done this, decide which of
them corresponds to each Station of the Wheel, and mark
them with the emblem of the Station,or in any other way
you choose.You may also want to get a bag of cloth or leather
to hold the eight stones. The only other preparations for the
working are those you need to open a grove.
Open in the usual way, with the stone you’ve chosen for
Samhuinn at the center of the altar; you won’t need the oth-
ers until later. In the Sphere of Protection, call upon the ele-
ments to bless and protect your grove and add their power to
your working, and banish any influences that might hinder
your work. Once you open the grove, take your seat in the
north, and use violet color breathing to attune yourself to the
energies of Samhuinn. Enter into meditation for a time, with
Samhuinn as the theme. Contemplate the autumn sunlight,

the lengthening nights, the fading leaves, and everything else

Imagine the grove filled with the nwyfre of Samhuinn.
When you are ready, breathe it all into yourself through
your solar plexus in the form of violet light. Then rise and go
to the altar. Pick up the stone with the index fingers and
thumbs of both hands, and allow all the violet light and the
presence of Samhuinn in you to flow into it. Say words such as
these:“In the name of Ceridwen I enchant you, creature of
stone, with the enchantment of Samhuinn. Embrace that en-
chantment, reflect it, and radiate it into the world.Yours is the
Station of Samhuinn in the circle of my grove. Keep watch in
the northwest.” Pick up the stone again, carry it to the north-
west edge of the grove, and set it on the ground there.
Return to the center and pause for a time, paying atten-
tion to the nwyfre of the ritual,then begin the grove closing
ceremony. When you have finished the closing, pick up the
stone and put it away—in your bag,if you have one, or in
whatever other place you choose to keep your grove
stones—before you clear away anything else from the grove.
When you next performa grove ceremony, place the Sam-
huinn stone in the northwest after you have set out every-
thing else needed for the ceremony, but before you begin it.
You will need to perform seven more ceremonies of the
same kind,changing the names and details as needed, and
enchanting one stone in each ceremony. If you wish, you can
do one ritual on each of the eight holy days, enchanting the
stone for each Station of the Wheel of Life on its correspon-
ding day;this produces a very powerful set of stones. It’s best
to proceed around the Wheel clockwise from Samhuinn, so
that you enchant the stone for Alban Arthuan next and the
one for Alban Elued last.Each time, when you enchant a

stone, put it in its position around the outside of the grove,
as shown in Figure 6-1, and use it to mark out the grove in
your workings thereafter. When you finish the process, you
will have eight enchanted stones to define the circle of your
grove in ritual, and the strength of your workings will
increase accordingly.
If you want to use some other number of stones beside
eight, you can certainly do so. Iolo Morganwg’s stone circles
had nineteen stones,modeled on the ancient stone circle at
Boscawen-Un in Cornwall. Some modern Druid orders use

stone circles with twelve stones, others use thirteen, and if
you belong to one of these orders or simply want to exper-
iment with a different number, choose an appropriate sym-
bolism and go to work.
Making a permanent circle of standing stones is a more
magically intensive process, because stones set up in the
Earth attract the solar and telluric currents and, under the
right circumstances, can give birth to the lunar current. A
way of handling the magical dimensions of this very tradi-
tional Druid practice is covered in chapter 8 of this book.

**The Druid Wand**
The basic method of enchantment used to make your circle
of stones has many other uses in practical magic, but you
should also learn how to do more intensive forms of
enchantment.One of these draws on the solar and telluric
currents and can be used to enchant the first of the three
principal working tools of the Druid mage, the wand.
Wands and staves of various kinds appear frequently in
Druid hands in the old Irish legends, and of course mages
around the world have used wands of various kinds for many
thousands of years.In the system of magic taught in this
book,the wand is an essential working tool, the instrument
used to direct and channel nwyfre in ritual.
Your first task, of course, is finding, buying, or making a
wand that suits your needs and tastes. It should certainly be
made of wood, should fit comfortably in your hand, and
should be short enough that you can make ritual gestures
and trace figures in the air in your usual working space with-
out hitting the furniture or the ceiling. Other than those sim-
ple rules, though, the details are up to you. The wand I use
most often for Druid magic—I have more than a dozen

**_162_** Part Two: The Practice of Druid Magic


wands in all—is around 14 inches long, was crafted from ma-
ple by a professional wandmaker, and has a quartz crystal
point set into the business end, but I have used wands rang-
ing in size from 6 inches to 8 feet, and in complexity from
branches picked up in the forest to intricate pieces worked
with seven metals and magically charged semiprecious stones.
Each one has its own energy, and the complicated ones are
not necessarily better.
Once you have your wand, wash it in cold running wa-
ter, preferably in a stream or river, and leave it in direct sun-
light for at least an hour to cleanse it of unwanted nwyfre.
You will need to make preparations for an ordinary grove
ceremony. If you want to do so, you can enchant your wand
on one of the eight festivals of the Druid year, or on some
other day that is special to you, but this is not required.
Place the wand on the center of the altar,and set your
grove stones around the outside of your ritual space, before
you begin the grove opening. Open in the usual way. In the
Sphere of Protection, call on the elements to fill the wand
with their power, and banish any hindrance to the enchant-
ment from the wand,the working,and the grove.When you
finish the opening and take your seat, use white color breath-
ing—the symbolic color of nwyfre—to prepare for the
meditation,and then meditate on the wand as a symbol and
a magical working tool.
When you are ready, rise and approach the altar. Say
words like these: “O my wand, you have been crafted from
the body of a tree that you may share in the work of Druid
magic. Before you may take up that work, you must make a
journey through the four elements.”
Circle around to the east side of the altar, facing the cen-
ter, and say, “Arise, and enter the realm of air.” Pick up the
wand and move it back and forth through the incense smoke

The Art of Enchantment **_163_**


from the air cauldron, so that every part receives some of the
smoke. Say words like these: “In the name of Hu and by the
powers of the realm of air I purify you and strengthen you
for your work.” Concentrate on the idea that the incense
smoke is cleansing the wand and filling it with the powers of
the element of air. When it feels right, return the wand to
the center of the altar.
Circle around to the south side of the altar, facing the
center, and say, “Arise, and enter the realm of fire.” Pick up
the wand and move it just above the flame in the fire caul-
dron, so that every part receives heat and light from the
flame. Say words like these: “In the name of Sul and by the
powers of the realm of fire I purify you and strengthen you
for your work.” Concentrate on the idea that the heat of the
flame is cleansing the wand and filling it with the powers of
the element of fire.When it feels right, return the wand to
the center of the altar.
Circle around to the west side of the altar,facing the
center, and say, “Arise, and enter the realm of water.” Pick up
the wand and hold it above the water cauldron, then dip the
fingers of one hand into the water and sprinkle the wand
with it, so that every part receives some of the water. Say
words like these: “In the name of Esus and by the powers of
the realm of water I purify you and strengthen you for your
work.” Concentrate on the idea that the water is cleansing
the wand and filling it with the powers of the element of
water. When it feels right, return the wand to the center of
the altar.
Circle around to the north side of the altar,facing the
center, and say, “Arise, and enter the realm of earth.” Pick up
the wand and hold it above the earth cauldron, and sprinkle
some of the salt or earth from the cauldron onto it, so that

**_164_** Part Two: The Practice of Druid Magic:


every part of it receives some. Say words like these: “In the
name of Elen and by the powers of the realm of earth I pur-
ify you and strengthen you for your work.” Concentrate on
the idea that the salt or earth is cleansing the wand and fill-
ing it with the powers of the element of earth.When it feels
right, return the wand to the center of the altar.
Turn your attention to the land beneath you, and imag-
ine the telluric current rising up from the heart of the Earth.
Say words like these: “When the four material elements are
in balance, the element of spirit appears in their midst.” Pick
up the wand, and use it to trace an invoking heather penta-
gram over the altar, saying, “I invoke Spirit Below. Let the
telluric current arise and bless this wand.” Place the wand on
the altar, and imagine a shaft of silver light rising from far
beneath you to shine on the wand. Make this image as vivid
as possible,and maintain it for several minutes at least.
Release the image, then, and turn your attention to the
sky above you. Imagine the solar current cascading down
through space from the Sun. Pick up the wand, feeling the
presence of the telluric current within it, and use it to trace
an invoking oak pentagram over the altar,saying words like
these: “I invoke Spirit Above. Let the solar current descent
and bless this wand.” Place the wand on the altar, and imag-
ine a shaft of golden light shining down from infinite space
above you to illumine the wand. Make this image as vivid as
possible, and maintain it for several minutes at least.
Pick up the wand again and hold it vertically with both
hands above the altar,in the middle of the space where you
traced the two pentagrams. Say words like these: “From
above to below, from below to above, the two currents are
awakened. I invoke Spirit Within. Let the lunar current be
born within this wand and fill it with the power of Awen.”

The Art of Enchantment **_165_**


Imagine the golden solar current and the silver telluric cur-
rent both shining into the wand at once, and then see them
fuse into pure white light, the color of lightning, in and
around the wand. Imagine the disk of the Moon surrounding
your hands and the shining wand. Once again, make this
image as vivid as possible, and hold it for several minutes at
least.
Then hold the wand in your right hand, and say, “I take
upon myself the power, the responsibility, and the burden of
this wand.The power to awaken and direct nwyfre in accord
with my intention; the responsibility to use that power well
and wisely, in harmony with the great pattern of all things;
and the burden of bearing the consequences if I fail to do so.”
At this point the wand is enchanted, and the best way to
make the enchantment lasting is to use the wand in its new
role as soon as possible.For this reason, holding the wand in
one hand, perform the Sphere of Protection ritual a second
time.Trace the symbols with the wand,but only in the invok-
ing form, and ask the elements to confirm and strengthen the
powers of the wand.When you have finished, proceed to the
grove closing ceremony.
Once you enchant it, your wand can be used any time
you perform the Sphere of Protection or the full Grove Cer-
emony. Use it to trace elemental symbols and pentagrams in
the air, and to direct and channel nwyfre for any purpose—
for example, when charging water or anything else in a mag-
ical working, you can direct the nwyfre through the wand
rather than through your hands. With practice, you will find
that using your wand in this way improves the intensity and
focus of the nwyfre you can place in a material substance.
Expect to learn other uses for your wand as you continue to
learn and practice magic.

**_166_** Part Two: The Practice of Druid Magic


**The Cauldron**
The ritual for consecrating the wand shows how the ele-
ments and the solar and telluric currents can be brought into
the work of enchantment.The eight Stations of the Wheel of
Life can also be used in much the same way. The second of
the three primary working tools of the Druid mage, the
cauldron, can be enchanted in this way, using the oak and
heather pentagrams.
In the Welsh traditions from which the Druid Revival
draws so much of its symbolism, magical cauldrons play an
important role. At the center of the Druid teaching of the
three circles of manifestation—Abred, the realm of plant,
animal, and human existence in the world of nature;
Gwynfydd,the realm of illumined existence beyond the
human level; and Ceugant, the realm of absolute unity that
no created being can traverse—stands the Cauldron of
Annwn.This cauldron is the reservoir of rawnwyfre at the
heart of existence, the place where souls are born, and
where souls who utterly fail to grasp the lessons of Abred
return and dissolve back into raw nwyfre.
Scarcely less important in Druid symbolism is the caul-
dron of Ceridwen, the wise old alchemist goddess in the leg-
end of Taliesin. Ceridwen’s cauldron held a brew containing
all the wisdom in the world, and had to be kept bubbling for
a year and a day. Among other things, this cauldron repre-
sents the Druid tradition itself, since this latter is brimful of
wisdom and embraces the whole circle of the seasons.
The cauldron of the Druid mage reflects both these
mythic cauldrons, but it also has a practical role in Druid ma-
gic. It serves as a reservoir of all the different forms and pat-
terns of nwyfre needed in magical work.The Druid mage can
draw any kind of nwyfre he or she wishes from the cauldron—

The Art of Enchantment **_167_**


the forces of the elements, the Stations of the Wheel, the
Ogham fews, and every other power used in Druid magic
are all there. To put them there requires enchantment, and
the invocations of the eight Stations of the Wheel are a suit-
able method for this work.
The first step in providing yourself with such a magical
cauldron, of course, is getting the physical cauldron itself.
Any cauldron-shaped vessel small enough to fit on top of
your altar will serve. The cauldron I use for Druid magic is
made of cast iron, about 5 inches across, with three stubby
legs underneath; I found it in a cookware store in a display
of cast-iron pots and pans. Other Druids I know use caul-
drons of brass, pottery, and glass, and all of these work well.
Once you have your cauldron, wash it thoroughly in cold
running water, preferably in a stream or river, and leave it in
direct sunlight for at least an hour to cleanse it of unwanted
nwyfre.You will also need to make preparations for an ordi-
nary grove ceremony. If you want to do so, you can enchant
your cauldron on one of the eight festivals of the Druid year,
or on some other day that is special to you, but this is not
required.
Set your grove stones around the edge of your ritual
space, place the cauldron on the center of the altar, and have
your wand on the altar as well, before you begin the grove
opening. Open in the usual way. In the Sphere of Protection,
trace the elemental symbols with your wand; call on the ele-
ments to fill the cauldron with their power, and banish any
hindrance to the enchantment from the cauldron, the work-
ing,and the grove. When you finish the opening and take
your seat, use blue color breathing—the color of gwyar—to
prepare for the meditation, and then meditate on the caul-
dron as a symbol and a magical working tool.

**_168_** Part Two: The Practice of Druid Magic


When you are ready, rise and approach the altar. Say
words like these: “O my cauldron, you have been made from
the substance of the Earth that you may share in the work of
Druid magic. Before you may take up that work, you must
make a journey through the four elements.”
Circle around to the east side of the altar, facing the cen-
ter, and say, “Arise, and enter the realm of air.” Pick up the
cauldron and move it back and forth through the incense
smoke, so that every part receives some of the smoke. Say
words like these: “In the name of Hu and by the powers of
the realm of air I purify you and strengthen you for your
work.” Concentrate on the idea that the incense smoke is
cleansing the cauldron and filling it with the powers of the
element of air.When it feels right, return the cauldron to the
center of the altar.
Circle around to the south side of the altar,facing the cen-
ter, and say, “Arise, and enter the realm of fire.” Pick up the
cauldron and move it just above the flame, so that every part
receives heat and light from the fire. Say words like these: “In
the name of Sul and by the powers of the realm of fire I pur-
ify you and strengthen you for your work.”Concentrate on the
idea that the heat of the flame is cleansing the cauldron and
filling it with the powers of the element of fire. When it feels
right,return the cauldron to the center of the altar.
Circle around to the west side of the altar, facing the
center, and say, “Arise, and enter the realm of water.” Pick up
the cauldron and hold it above the water, then dip the fingers
of one hand into the water and sprinkle the cauldron with it,
so that every part receives some of the water. Say words like
these: “In the name of Esus and by the powers of the realm of
water I purify you and strengthen you for your work.” Con-
centrate on the idea that the water is cleansing the cauldron

The Art of Enchantment **_169_**


and filling it with the powers of the element of water. When
it feels right, return the cauldron to the center of the altar.
Circle around to the north side of the altar, facing the
center, and say, “Arise, and enter the realm of earth.” Pick up
the cauldron and hold it above the earth cauldron, and sprin-
kle some of the salt or earth onto it, so that every part of it
receives some. Say words like these: “In the name of Elen
and by the powers of the realm of earth I purify you and
strengthen you for your work.” Concentrate on the idea that
the salt or earth is cleansing the cauldron and filling it with
the powers of the element of earth. When it feels right,
return the cauldron to the center of the altar, where it will
remain for the rest of the working.
Much of the rest of the ritual depends on the time of
year when you perform this rite, because you need to start
by invoking the current Station of the telluric current, and
then proceed around the Wheel from there. You will be
drawing a total of eight pentagrams,and facing in eight
directions. The pentagrams are always drawn in the same
way and the same order: the heather pentagram from the
bottom point first,then the two heather pentagrams starting
with the left-hand points, then the oak pentagram starting
on the upper left point, then the oak pentagram starting on
the top point,then the oak pentagrams starting on the two
right-hand points, then the heather pentagram starting on
the lower right point. On the other hand, the Stations you
invoke, the words you say, and the directions you face, all
change depending on the season.
For example, if you are enchanting your cauldron
between November 1 and December 20, the solar current at
that time is flowing through the Station of Samhuinn and the
telluric current through Belteinne. You would begin this

**_170_** Part Two: The Practice of Druid Magic


phase of the working by moving clockwise around the altar
until you stand in the northwest, facing the cauldron on the
altar and, beyond it, the stone representing Belteinne. If you
are doing the working at a different time of the year, start
with whatever Station holds the telluric current, facing across
the altar toward the stone that corresponds to that Station. A
glance at Figure 6-1 will make this easier to follow.
Next, using your wand, trace an invoking heather penta-
gram,starting with the lowermost point, in the air above the
cauldron. Hold the tip of your wand at the lower point of the
pentagram, and invoke the Station corresponding to the fes-
tival opposite the one you celebrated most recently. In the
example of a ritual done just after Samhuinn,you might use
words such as these: “I invoke the power of Belteinne, the fes-
tival of life and love. Let the power of Belteinne enter into this
cauldron and bless it for its work.”Move the tip of the wand
down into the mouth of the cauldron. As you do so, imagine
the energies of Belteinne (or whatever Station is aligned with
the telluric current at the time you do the ritual) flowing into
the tip of the wand and then down into the cauldron. Hold this
for several minutes.
Now trace another invoking heather pentagram in the
air above the altar, this time starting with the lower left
point.Hold the tip of your wand at that point, and invoke
the Station that will come next in the yearly cycle. In the
example, this would be Alban Heruin, and you might use
words such as these: “I invoke the power of Alban Heruin,
the Station of the Sun in his summer glory.Let the power of
Alban Heruin enter into this cauldron and bless it for its
work.” Then move the tip of the wand down into the mouth
of the cauldron. As you do so, imagine the energies of Alban
Heruin (or whatever Station is next at the time you do the

The Art of Enchantment **_171_**


ritual) flowing into the tip of the wand and then down into
the cauldron. Hold this for several minutes.
Go on to the next Station—in the example, this would
be Lughnasadh—and trace a heather pentagram beginning
with the upper left point. Invoke the Station in your own
words, move the wand from the point of the pentagram to
the mouth of the cauldron, and transfer the power of the
Station to the cauldron.
Go to the next Station—in the example, this would be
Alban Elued.The fourth Station you invoke, whatever it may
be, is the first Station in the realm of the solar current at the
time you perform your ritual, and so you need trace an
invoking oak pentagram instead of a heather pentagram,
starting from the upper left point. Do the same things you
did with the first three Stations you invoked. In the same
way,invoke the next three Stations: face the appropriate
direction, trace an oak pentagram for each one, and invoke
the three other Stations of the Wheel that are in the solar
realm at the time of your ritual. Finally, move around the
altar to face the one remaining direction, and invoke the one
remaining Station—in the example,this is Alban Eiler—
with a heather pentagram traced clockwise from the lower
right point.
Then touch the rim of the cauldron with your right
hand.Say, “I take upon myself the power, the responsibility,
and the burden of this cauldron. The power to draw forth
from it nwyfre of every kind; the responsibility to use that
power wisely and well, in harmony with the great pattern of
all things;and the burden of bearing the consequences if I fail
to do so.”
Now, just as you did when you enchanted the wand, you
need to use the powers you have called into the cauldron, in

**_172_** Part Two: The Practice of Druid Magic


The Art of Enchantment **_173_**

```
order to make the enchantment stable. This is best done by
performing the Sphere of Protection ritual a second time,
before you go on to the closing ceremony. Since the caul-
dron is a receptive tool rather than an active one, this is done
in a different way.
Perform the Elemental Cross first in the usual way.
Next, pick up the wand, and use the tip to draw the invok-
ing symbol of air above the mouth of the cauldron.
Imagine that the cauldron fills at once with yellow light that
swirls and dances with all the energies of air. Dip the tip of
the wand into the mouth of the cauldron, as though you
were dipping a brush into a pot of paint. As you take the
wand’s tip out of the cauldron, imagine that all the yellow
light comes with it,forming a sphere around the end of the
wand. Go to the eastern edge of the grove and use that yel-
low light like paint,to draw the invoking symbol of air in the
usual way. Call upon the powers of air to confirm and
strengthen the powers of the cauldron.Don’t trace the ban-
ishing symbol at all.
Return to the altar and, using the tip of the wand, draw
the invoking symbol of fire over the mouth of the caul-
dron. See the cauldron fill with red light full of the nwyfre
of fire. Dip the end of the wand in the light, and use it to
drawthe invoking fire symbol in the south, then invoke the
powers of fire. Do the same thing with the energies and
invoking symbols of water and earth.
Next, use the circle of spirit to invoke Spirit Below
and Above, and the symbol of the three rays of light /| \, the
traditional Druid emblem of Awen,to awaken Spirit Within
in the cauldron. In each case, call on the elements to confirm
and strengthen the powers of the cauldron. Proceed as usual
to the Circulation of Light.When you have finished the second
```

Sphere of Protection, go on to the closing ceremony and
perform this in the usual way.
Once you have enchanted your cauldron, it can be used
as a reservoir of nwyfre to be shaped and directed by the
wand. If you wish, you no longer need to use the four bowls
orcauldrons of air, fire, water, and earth used in the grove
opening ritual. You can simply draw each of these elements
from the cauldron, dipping your wand into them and using
each of them in turn to trace a circle around the grove,
where you would otherwise pick up one of the elements and
carry it around the grove. Your cauldron will always be full
of the seven elements and the nwyfre of the eight Stations. It
can also be filled with other forms of nwyfre in magical rit-
ual.Working with the Ogham fews makes an excellent intro-
duction to this side of Druid magic.

**Preparation for Ogham Magic**
Each of the twenty-five Ogham fews, as mentioned back in
chapter 2, makes a connection between two of the Stations
of the Wheel of Life.Each of these connections has its own
special quality of nwyfre, with a more precise focus than the
broad energies of the elements or the Stations of the Wheel.
These forman essential part of the Druid mage’s toolkit.
If you want to work magic for protection, for example,
you can use the broad brush of the element of earth or the
Station of Alban Heruin if you wish, since both of these have
general protective powers. On the other hand, you can call
on any one of five fews with more exact powers: Luis dispels
delusion, Fearn invokes the protection of the gods and god-
desses, Duir brings great strength, Straif imposes barriers
that cannot be crossed, and Eadha shields you against hostil-

**_174_** Part Two: The Practice of Druid Magic


ity and misfortune. One or another of these may do much
more for your specific needs than a more general protective
working.
If you want to make use of the fews and their nwyfre,
though, you need to understand them thoroughly and make
contact with them on inner levels. As bare physical signs,
scratches on a piece of wood or stone, they have no power.
They function magically only when awakened as symbols of
imaginal and formal realities, and this takes work.
The process began when you started doing Ogham div-
inations as a daily practice in chapter 3. By keeping up this
practice, you already know quite a bit about the fews from
seeing them reflected in the events of your daily life. Build-
ing on that foundation starts with meditation. Take each of
the Ogham fews as a theme for meditation for at least three
sessions,and as many more as you find useful.
If you wish to go beyond this, meditate on the corre-
spondences of the fews listed in _The Druidry Handbook_ or any
other book of Ogham lore, taking each correspondence as a
theme and exploring how it relates to the meaning of the
few.This will give you a good grasp of the nature of each few.
This will take around two years even if you meditate on one
correspondence every day. It’s a project worth pursuing when
you decide you want to get into the deeper dimensions of
the fews—I have done it, and the results were well worth
the time it took—but this level of intensity is not needed to
start using the fews in magic.
Scrying forms the next stage in your work with the
Ogham fews. Each of the five _aicme,_ or groups, of fews is as-
signed to one of the elements.The first aicme, from Beith to
Saille, belongs to air; the second, from Huath to Quert, be-
longs to fire; the third, from Muin to Ruis, belongs to water;

The Art of Enchantment **_175_**


the fourth, from Ailm to Ioho, belongs to earth, and the
forfedha belong to spirit. You enter the realm of each few
through the quarter of its element, imagining a portal there
in place of the elemental sign you used in your first scryings.
The portal of Beith, in other words, is in the east, that of
Duir in the south, that of Gort in the west, and that of Ioho
in the north; the forfedha can be reached either above or
below, as your intuition guides you. Place your chair so that
it faces across the altar toward the direction of the portal. If
you plan on scrying Beith, for example, your chair will be in
the west, facing east across the altar. After you open the
grove, sit in the west and practice color breathing, using the
traditional colors of the fews from Table 6-2. Then meditate
on Beith for a time,before imagining the Inner Grove and
beginning your scrying, using the same approach you used in
scrying the elements in the work of chapter 5.

**_176_** Part Two: The Practice of Druid Magic


You can scry each few as soon as you finish meditating on
it, or wait until you have meditated on all of them before you
begin scrying them, as you wish. The scrying process will
give you plenty of new themes for meditation since, just as
you did when scrying the elements, you should plan on med-
itating on any symbols or ideas that surface during a scrying.
Abit of traditional lore suggests that you should plan on
spending three sessions in meditation for every one you
devote to scrying. In my experience, this can be considered
a bare minimum.

**Ogham Pathworking**
A final stage of preparation for Ogham magic, and one of the
most powerful forms of imaginal work in its own right, is the
art of Pathworking.This goes one step beyond scrying by put-
ting the Ogham few in relationship to the two Stations of the
Wheel it connects. When you do a Pathworking, you travel
from one Station to another on an imaginal journey through
an inner landscape established by the Ogham few.
This is not quite what many people in the occult com-
munity mean when they talk about Pathworking, and the dif-
ference needs to be understood clearly. To many occultists
these days, a Pathworking is a guided visualization meant to
be read aloud from a prepared script.The events of the expe-
rience are planned out ahead of time, and the people doing
this sort of Pathworking imagine themselves going through
the events and encountering the beings described to them.
Work of this kind can be useful, especially for beginners, but
it has serious limits and does little to develop your own abil-
ity to experience the imaginal world directly.
The approach to Pathworking used in Druid magic
builds on the art of scrying instead. Start by preparing for

The Art of Enchantment **_177_**


scrying in the usual way, with the grove opening, Sphere of
Protection, color breathing, and a brief meditation. Instead
of imagining yourself in the Inner Grove, however, imagine
yourself in one of the eight places listed in Table 6-3, corre-
sponding to the eight Stations of the Wheel of Life. Imagine
the place in the colors of the Station, and picture the
emblem of the Station near the altar. Make all this imagery
asclear and vivid as possible.
When you are ready, rise from the chair in your imagi-
nation, and go to the altar. Imagine yourself picking up the
wand and tracing a pentagram to invoke the Station where
you wish to start your Pathworking. As always, the penta-
gram you use and the point you start from will change
depending on the season of the year. In your own words, in-
voke the powers of the Station, and ask that they watch over
you as you travel the inner path to the Station you intend to
reach at the end of your Pathworking.
For example,your first Pathworking would traditionally
be from Alban Arthuan to Imbolc along the path of Beith,
few of the birch tree. After the usual preparations, you
would start this by imagining yourself high in the northern
sky, surrounded on all sides by stars. The stars blaze white
and gold, and a crown floats in the air above the altar. You
imagine yourself rising and walking across a floor paved with
stars toward the altar. If you were doing this Pathworking
between Alban Elued and Samhuinn, let’s say, you would
invoke Alban Arthuan with an invoking heather pentagram,
starting from the upper right corner and tracing the penta-
gram in a clockwise direction.You might then say words
such as these: “In the name of Hu the Mighty, the great Druid
god, I invoke the powers of Alban Arthuan to watch over me
as I travel the path of Beith to the Station of Imbolc.”

**_178_** Part Two: The Practice of Druid Magic


At this point, you would begin a scrying of Beith in the
usual way. Unless you have been this way before, ask for a
guide on the path, and ask your guide to lead you to the por-
tal of the Station you intend to reach—in the example, Im-
bolc. Proceed as in any other scrying. When you get to the
portal of the Station on the other end, thank your guide and
imagine yourself entering into that Station. See it in the
form given in Table 6-3, with the colors and emblem listed
there. Imagine yourself walking up to the altar and tracing a
pentagram to invoke the Station you have just reached. Once
you have done this, thank the powers of the Station in your
own words for welcoming you, take your seat in the grove,
and begin the closing as usual.
In the example, for instance, you would imagine your-
self entering into a cavern deep within the Earth, all in earth
colors and black,with a circle of eight candles around the

altar.You would approach the altar and invoke Imbolc with a
heather pentagram, traced clockwise from the lower left
point.You might then say, “In the name of Ana, the goddess
of the Earth’s deep places, I invoke the powers of the Station
of Imbolc. Thank you for receiving me and giving me your
hospitality.” You would then take your seat in the grove, and
close in the usual way.
Pathworking in this way is a potent magical technique.
Few things will teach you as much about the Ogham fews,
their relationship to the Stations, and the Wheel of Life as a
whole. As you work your way through the whole set of fews,
you will find that your ability to use them in magic and div-
ination increases dramatically, and the guides who appear on
the paths can teach you much about Druid magic.
It works best to start Pathworking with the Ogham fews
by doing each fewonce in order, from Beith all the way to
Mór. Koad alone of the fews does not stand for a path; it rep-
resents the Central Grove, and Pathworkings of Koad
involve sitting in the Central Grove itself and seeing what
entities come to meet you.This can be at least as complex as
any inner journey! All the others give you a framework for a
journey. Once you have traveled each few once, you can
repeat the process, or focus on those fews you feel you need
to understand better. You can also use a Pathworking of a
particular few as part of a ritual working to invoke the few
for magical purposes, as explained next.

**Ogham in Practical Magic**
Once you have meditated on a few and explored it in scry-
ing, you have the connection with that few you need to use
it in magic. A simple way to do this is to add a single Ogham

**_180_** Part Two: The Practice of Druid Magic


few to the Sphere of Protection ritual. Start by choosing a few
that corresponds to your intention—for example, Tinne to
focus your energies on a goal, or Ailm to give you a clearer
awareness of a situation. Begin the Sphere of Protection ri-
tual in the usual way, and proceed all the way to the Gate of
Spirit Above, asking the elements to further your intention as
you invoke them, and banishing all obstacles to its fulfillment.
At the Gate of Spirit Within, though, the ritual changes.
Be aware of the six elements around you in the usual way,
and then draw the Ogham few in the air in front of you with
the first two fingers of your right hand. Draw the vertical
stem line of the few from bottom to top, and then draw the
other lines on it.Imagine the lines drawn in colored light,
using the traditional color of the few itself.
Imagine the few glowing in the air before you, and say
words like the following:“By the light that was before the
worlds, by the creative power of Awen, I trace the few [name
of few]. By its power, [here state your intention aloud].”
Hold the few clearly in your imagination for a time, then

to top.

**Figure 6-2 Tracing an Ogham Few**


release the image and allow it to dissolve completely. Pro-
ceed to the Circulation of Light as usual.
Ogham magic can also be worked on a more intensive
level, in a grove ritual. Prepare for the ritual by placing your
chair so that you face the direction of the few across the
altar, just as though you meant to scry the few. Your wand
and cauldron should be on the altar. Open the grove in the
usual way, take your seat in the grove, and spend several
minutes doing color breathing using the traditional color of
the few. Meditate on your intention and on how it relates to
the few you have chosen. If you have explored the few in
Pathworking, you can do another Pathworking along the
same path at this point, to help yourself focus the energies of
the few.
When you are ready, rise and go to the altar. Take your
wand and dip its tip in the cauldron,and imagine the caul-
dron filling with light of the traditional color of the few.
Then,as though your wand was a brush and the light was
paint, draw the few in the air above the cauldron and see it
shining there. Say words such as the following: “By the light
that was before the worlds,by the creative power of Awen, I
trace the few [name of few]. By its power, [state your inten-
tion here].” Pause for a time, concentrating on the image of
the few.
Next,use the wand to trace an invoking heather penta-
gram over the altar, with the lowermost point just below the
lower end of the stem. See the lines of the pentagram drawn
in silver light. Say, “I invoke Spirit Below. Let the telluric
current ascend and fill this fewwith its might.”Imagine a
shaft of silver light rising up from the heart of the Earth to
shine into the few. Make this image as vivid as possible, and
maintain it for several minutes at least.

**_182_** Part Two: The Practice of Druid Magic


Now use the wand to trace an invoking oak pentagram
with its uppermost point just above the upper end of the
few’s vertical line. See the lines of the pentagram drawn in
golden light. Say, “I invoke Spirit Above. Let the solar current
descend and fill this few with its might.” Imagine a shaft of
golden light descending from far above you to shine into the
few. Make this image as vivid as possible, and maintain it for
several minutes at least.
Point the wand at the center of the few, and say, “From
above to below, from below to above, the two currents are
awakened. I invoke Spirit Within. Let the lunar current be
born within this few and fill it with the power of Awen.”
Imagine the golden solar current and the silver telluric cur-
rent both shining into the few at once, and then see them
fuse into pure white light, the color of lightning, in and
around the few.Imagine the disk of the Moon surrounding
the few. Make this image as vivid as possible, hold it for sev-
eral minutes at least, and then release it. When you are
ready, close the ritual in the usual way.

**The Crane Bag**
According to Irish legend,one of the great treasures of the
sea god Manannan mac Lir was a bag made of the skin of a
magical crane. In his crane bag, the god stored the shears of
the king of Alba (Scotland), the helmet of the king of
Lochlann (Norway), the bones of Asail’s pig, the belt and fish
hook of Goibniu the smith god, and Manannan’s own house.
These may seem unlikely contents for a craneskin bag, but
any Irish bard would have realized at once that the legend
referred to the five forfedha of the Ogham alphabet. The
“shears” are Koad, which looks like an open pair of scissors;

The Art of Enchantment **_183_**


the “helmet” is Oir, which looks like an old Irish helmet seen
from above; the “bones” are Uilleand, which looks like
crossed bones; the “belt and fish hook” are Phagos, which
looks like a hook hanging from a belt; and the “house” is Mór
the sea, the proper house of a sea god.
Cranes have traditional links with writing, because mi-
grating cranes look like letters drawn against the sky. The
crane bag of Irish legend, then, is the Ogham alphabet itself.
In modern Druid practice, by contrast, it is a small bag used
to hold sacred objects, not unlike a Native American medi-
cine pouch, and many Druids use one to hold their Ogham
sticks. Worn on a strap or cord around the neck, so that the
bag rests at the level of your heart or solar plexus, the crane
bag also functions as what modern mages call a _lamen_ —a
symbolic object worn on the chest that represents your
essential spiritual aspirations.
The first step in equipping yourself with a crane bag is to
get a bag of cloth or leather just large enough to hold your
set of Ogham sticks, or any other objects you intend to put
in it. The color, shape, and design of the bag are up to you,
but it should have a strap or cord that allows you to hang it
around your neck. If you wish, it may have a Druid symbol
on the front.
Once you have your crane bag, leave it in direct sunlight
for at least an hour to cleanse it of unwanted nwyfre. If it can
be washed in cold running water without damage—most
leather and many cloth bags can’t be—by all means do so.
You will also need to make preparations for an ordinary
grove ceremony. If you want to do so, you can enchant your
crane bag on one of the festivals of the Druid year, or on
some other day that is special to you, but this is not required.
Set your grove stones around the edge of your ritual
space, and have your cauldron and wand on the altar. Your

**_184_** Part Two: The Practice of Druid Magic


crane bag goes at the center of the altar. Open the grove in
the usual way. In the Sphere of Protection, trace the elemen-
tal symbols with your wand; call on the elements to fill the
crane bag with their power, and banish any hindrance to the
enchantment from the crane bag, the working, and the grove.
When you finish the opening and take your seat, use green
color breathing—the color of the Druid element calas—to
prepare for the meditation, and then meditate on the crane
bag as a symbol and a magical working tool.
When you are ready, rise and approach the altar. Say
words like these: “O my crane bag, you have been made from
(here say something about the substance from which it is
made) that you may share in the work of Druid magic. Be-
fore you may take up that work, you must make a journey
through the four elements.”
Circle around to the east side of the altar,facing the cen-
ter, and say, “Arise, and enter the realm of air.” Pick up the
crane bag and move it back and forth through the incense
smoke, so that every part receives some of the smoke. Say
words like these: “In the name of Hu and by the powers of
the realm of air I purify you and strengthen you for your
work.” Concentrate on the idea that the incense smoke is
cleansing the crane bag and filling it with the powers of the
element of air.When it feels right, return the bag to the cen-
ter of the altar.
Circle around to the south side of the altar, facing the
center, and say, “Arise, and enter the realm of fire.” Pick up
the crane bag and move it above the flame, so that every part
receives heat and light from the fire; be careful not to let it
actually contact the flame, however! Say words like these: “In
the name of Sul and by the powers of the realm of fire I pu-
rify you and strengthen you for your work.” Concentrate on
the idea that the heat of the flame is cleansing the crane bag

The Art of Enchantment **_185_**


and filling it with the powers of the element of fire. When it
feels right, return the bag to the center of the altar.
Circle around to the west side of the altar, facing the cen-
ter, and say, “Arise, and enter the realm of water.” Pick up the
crane bag and hold it above the water, then dip the fingers of
one hand into the water and sprinkle the crane bag with it, so
that every part receives some of the water. Say words like
these: “In the name of Esus and by the powers of the realm of
water I purify you and strengthen you for your work.”
Concentrate on the idea that the water is cleansing the crane
bag and filling it with the powers of the element of water.
When it feels right, return the bag to the center of the altar.
Circle around to the north side of the altar, facing the
center,and say, “Arise, and enter the realm of earth.” Pick up
the crane bag and hold it above the earth cauldron, and
sprinkle some of the salt or earth onto it,so that every part
of it receives some. Say words like these: “In the name of
Elen and by the powers of the realm of earth I purify you and
strengthen you for your work.” Concentrate on the idea that
the salt or earth is cleansing the crane bag and filling it with
the powers of the element of earth.When it feels right,
return the crane bag to the center of the altar.
Pause, and then pick up your wand. Touch the crane bag
with the tip of the wand, and say, “Receive the blessing of the
receptive powers of the cosmos, that you may manifest all
the powers of the telluric current.” Imagine nwyfre flowing
from the wand into the crane bag, filling it with power.
When it feels right, put the wand down, and pick up the
crane bag.Touch it to the rim of the cauldron, and say,
“Receive the blessing of the active powers of the cosmos,
that you may contain all the powers of the solar current.”
Imagine nwyfre flowing from the cauldron into the crane

**_186_** Part Two: The Practice of Druid Magic


bag, filling it with power. When it feels right, put the crane
bag down.
Then take the crane bag and put it around your neck so
that it hangs at the level of your heart. Say, “I take upon
myself the power, the responsibility, and the burden of this
crane bag. The power to wield nwyfre; the responsibility to
use that power wisely and well, in harmony with the great
pattern of all things; and the burden of bearing the conse-
quences if I fail to do so.”
At this point your crane bag is fully enchanted. As you did
with your other working tools, your next step is to perform
a Sphere of Protection ritual using only the invoking forms of
the elemental symbols.Use your cauldron as the source of
elemental energies, as you did after enchanting it, and use
your wand to trace the circles and the elemental symbols.
Your crane bag remains in its place on your chest.As you
invoke each of the seven elements, ask the elemental powers
in your own words to confirm and strengthen the power of
the crane bag. Once you have finished, close in the usual way.

**Weaving Your Own Enchantments**
As you finish the work outlined in this chapter, you will
wield the three working tools of the Druid mage together
for the first time. At this point the possibilities open before
you come close to infinity, and one of the major challenges
you face is that of deciding what to do with your skills at the
art of enchantment.

**_Other Working Tools_**
One practical and traditional use for enchantment is the cre-
ation of other working tools to fit the particular needs of

The Art of Enchantment **_187_**


your own magical path. Anything you use in a magical setting
can be enchanted to make it a better channel for your inten-
tions. Druids who practice herbal magic, for example, com-
monly enchant the knife they use to cut herbs, the mortar
and pestle they use to powder them, and other pieces of
equipment, while those who practice different kinds of divina-
tion often enchant their divining tools. If you travel in the
wilderness, a magical staff is an obvious and useful acces-
sory. Here as so often in magic, the possibilities are limited
only by your imagination and your willingness to do the work.

**_Talismans_**
Another valuable use of enchantment is the art of making
and using talismans.A talisman is a physical object filled with
nwyfre and charged with a specific intention. Once charged,
it sends the pattern of its intentionality out through the
nwyfre night and day until and unless you disenchant it.This
persistent and steady effect can accomplish wonders over
time, so talismans are among the most effective tools magic
has to offer for intentions you plan on making a permanent
part of your life.
In many magical traditions, talismans take the form of
disks of paper or metal with complex symbols painted, drawn,
or etched on them. Most Druids who practice magic, by con-
trast,use a simpler approach. A short twig of a symbolically
appropriate wood—one of the Ogham woods works well
for this—can be marked with one or several Ogham fews,
and then enchanted using any of the ritual methods covered
in this chapter.Once enchanted,the talisman may be worn,
tucked into a pocket, or put near a place where you spend
much of your time.

**_188_** Part Two: The Practice of Druid Magic


If the talisman is no longer needed for some reason, and
you do not want to keep its energies in place, it should be
disenchanted. This is best done by a simple ritual. Open a
grove in the usual way. In the Sphere of Protection, call on
each of the elements to take back the energies placed in the
talisman.Then, one at a time, trace the banishing form of each
of the elemental symbols over the talisman, saying words such
as, “O my talisman, I release you from your task. Let the
energies of (element) placed in you return to their source.”
Imagine the elemental nwyfre flowing out of the talisman
and returning to the direction of the element.When you are
done, close in the usual way. The disenchanted talisman
should then be washed in cold running water and left in sun-
light for several hours at least. When it is thoroughly dry, it
can then be burnt to release the last traces of nwyfre in it.

**_Two Other Enchantments_**
Two other forms of enchantment require a closer study and
have chapters to themselves.You can apply the skills you have
learned to the material thing closest to you—your own
body.Work of this kind forms one of the main branches of
traditional magical lore. Since the natural flows of nwyfre
inside you play a crucial role in maintaining health and keep-
ing your body alive in the first place, some care needs to be
taken in bringing more nwyfre into the picture, but the
Druid tradition contains proven methods to do this while
increasing your health, strength, and magical power. A set of
workings along these lines are covered in chapter 7.
Afinal and even more challenging focus for enchant-
ment is the world around you. If the problems of today’s
society have their roots in the disenchantment of the world,

The Art of Enchantment **_189_**


as Max Weber suggested back in 1904, one of the greatest
contributions magic can make to the present crisis is its
power to reenchant the world. Like the enchantment of the
body, this forms one of the main branches of traditional mag-
ical lore, and it also requires careful handling of powerful
forces. A set of rituals for this purpose is given in chapter 8.

**_190_** Part Two: The Practice of Druid Magic


## Chapter 7 The Secret of the Grail

Magical traditions from around the world affirm that some
of the greatest secrets of magic and nature can be found
within the human body itself. Like everything else in exis-
tence,the body contains nwyfre,gwyar, and calas. Its calas is
the flesh and bone that give it a material form. Its gwyar is the
dance of blood, lymph, and other fluids that flow through it
constantly and keep it in balance. These two aspects of the
body are both well understood by modern science.
The third aspect, the nwyfre of the body, has been neg-
lected by today’s materialist science but thoroughly explored
in occult secret societies,as well as the healing traditions of
other cultures less obsessed with materialist ideologies.
Most people nowadays have heard of the chakras, seven cen-
ters of life force that play a central role in many traditions of
Hindu mysticism, and the meridians, channels of life force
used by Chinese healers to map out where to use massage,
acupuncture, and other healing techniques. Students of Asian
martial arts learn to focus their energy at the _tan t’ien_ or _hara,_
the point just below the navel that this system of Druid
magic calls the “womb center,” while practitioners of
Western magical traditions have their own teachings about
energy centers, such as the five centers of the Middle Pillar
used in the Golden Dawnsystem of magic.


One thing about these systems of subtle anatomy causes
confusion among many students, especially in the modern
Western world: no two of them are exactly the same. Even
within the same tradition, teachings vary. Hindu writings on
the chakras, for example, list anything from four to twelve
chakras along the spine, and those that follow the most com-
mon teaching and list seven chakras put the third one in
many different places—the womb center, the solar plexus,
and the region of the spleen are the most common, but other
locations show up in the literature.
It’s embarrassingly common for people trained in differ-
ent systems to get into ferocious disputes about whose system
is the right one. All such disagreements are wasted breath,
because the energy centers are patterns in nwyfre—specifi-
cally in the enaid, the body of nwyfre that surrounds and
penetrates our bodies of gwyar and calas—and like anything
made of nwyfre, they are formed and changed by imagina-
tion and intentionality.When you are born,most of the cen-
ters in the enaid exist as potentials only, and if you never take
up the challenge of a spiritual path, they remain unused
potentials from cradle to grave.When you begin training in
a system of spiritual development, some of those potential
centers awaken, while others remain asleep. The number,
nature, and position of the centers awakened by spiritual
practice vary depending on the kind of inner work you do.
A complex series of tradeoffs affects the practices used
in any spiritual tradition.The fewer centers you activate, the
more powerful each one will be, but the fewer things you
will be able to do with them;the more centers you activate,
the more options you have but the weaker each will be.
Centers low on the body have most of their effects in the
world we experience with our physical senses; centers in the
middle of the body have most of their effects in the world we

**_192_** Part Two: The Practice of Druid Magic


experience with our thoughts, feelings, and imagination;
centers in the neck and head have most of their effects on the
world we experience through intuition and the spiritual
senses. Depending on what you want to do with the life
force, you may need a larger or smaller number of centers
higher or lower on the body, and resonating with different
physical organs, glands, and the like.
Many spiritual traditions use indirect methods to awaken
the centers. Ordinary prayer, for example, uses a specific
posture-head bowed, hands pressed palm to palm at heart
level—to concentrate nwyfre at centers in the heart and
throat. Sounds that resonate at specific points in the body,
such as the mantras of Hindu and Buddhist traditions,have
effects of the same kind.
Most of the world’s traditions of ritual magic, however,
awaken the centers directly, using the same tools of imagina-
tion, symbolism, and intentionality they apply to every other
dimension of magical work. The exercises they use for this
purpose differ just as extensively as the centers they awaken.
This is as inevitable as it is appropriate, since different mag-
ical traditions have different goals, methods, symbols,
sources of nwyfre, and guiding philosophies. The core exer-
cise used in the tradition of Druid magic taught in this book,
then,differs from most of the exercises you have likely
encountered in other books. Its name is the Inner Grail
working. It is the active working for Spirit Within, and it
sums up in itself most of the work you have done so far.

**The Three Cauldrons**
As you have probably noticed by now, Druids like the num-
ber three, and use it fairly often to structure symbolism and
ritual.The subject of the present chapter is no exception, for

The Secret of the Grail **_193_**


the Inner Grail working comprises three stages, and the first
stage focuses nwyfre on three subtle centers within the
enaid—three cauldrons that unite to form the Grail.
These are not the only centers of nwyfre used in Druid
magic, of course, nor is the Inner Grail working the only
exercise that awakens centers in the enaid. The Elemental
Cross, the very first magical ritual you learned in this book,
focuses nwyfre on two centers, one in the middle of the
head,the other at the solar plexus. These centers are crucial
in the early phases of magical training; the center in the head
helps strengthen your ability to sense nwyfre, while the solar
plexus is the portal through which nwyfre from outside you
becomes part of your enaid.
These centers remain important, and the center in the
head takes on a new role as the container for the lunar cur-
rent.Two other centers of nwyfre, however—in the center
of the chest and the lower belly—become crucial at this
point.These centers and the one in the head have been men-
tioned already, in the discussion of the three currents back in
chapter 1.They appear in the world’s magical traditions under
many different names.The names we use are the cauldrons
of the earth, the Moon, and the Sun.
Before you begin working with the cauldrons in ritual,
practice imagining them in your body. First, picture the
cauldron of the earth in the middle of your belly, about two
inches below the level of your navel. Make it four inches or
so across, the color of dark bronze, with a triangle on its side
to represent the secret fire. This cauldron corresponds to
vitality,the passions and the material body, and forms your
link with the telluric current.
Once you have this image firmly in place, picture the
cauldron of the Sun in the middle of your chest at the level

**_194_** Part Two: The Practice of Druid Magic


of your heart. Make it the same size as the cauldron of the
earth but the color of red gold, with a sunburst on its side.
It corresponds to reason, emotion, and imagination, and con-
nects you with the solar current.
After getting this image firmly in place, picture the third
cauldron, the cauldron of the Moon, in the middle of your
head.Imagine it the size of the others but made of crystal,
with a crescent Moon on its side. It corresponds to intuition,
inspiration, and enlightenment, and forms the vessel where
the lunar current will manifest once you create it.

**_The Three Cauldrons Ritual_**
When you can easily imagine all three cauldrons in their
places, the next step is a ritual working to begin filling the
cauldrons with nwyfre. This is best done on one of the eight
holy days of the Druid calendar, but if your circumstances
don’t allow this, any time will do. If you have any questions

about your readiness for this ritual, cast an Ogham reading
to settle your doubts. Set up your working space for an ordi-
nary grove ritual, using your wand, cauldron, and crane bag,
and open the grove in the usual way. When you cast the
Sphere of Protection, ask the first four elements to assist you
in awakening the three cauldrons inside you, and banish any
obstacle that hinders you from awakening them.
Once you reach the invocations of the three forms of
spirit, however, the ritual leaves familiar ground behind.
When you invoke Spirit Below, trace the orange circle and say
words like these: “By the bright heart of the Earth Mother,
and in the great name Ced, I invoke Spirit Below, its gods, its
spirits, and its powers. May a ray of the telluric current
ascend into me this day and always. May the cauldron of the
Moon be filled within me.” Breathe in, and as you do so,
imagine yourself drawing the telluric current up through the
soles of both feet, up your legs, and into the lowest of the
three cauldrons.As you breathe out, imagine the cauldron
filled and surrounded with silvery light that ripples like
water. Repeat this process, drawing the telluric current into
the cauldron on the inbreath and letting it radiate there on
the outbreath, nine times in all. Then say, “I thank Spirit
Below for its gifts.”
Go on to the invocation of Spirit Above, trace the purple
circle as usual,and say words like these: “By the Sun in its
glory, the father of light, and in the great name Celi, I invoke
Spirit Above, its gods, its spirits, and its powers. May a ray of
the solar current descend into me this day and always. May
the cauldron of the Sun be filled within me.”Breathe in, and
as you do so, imagine yourself drawing the solar current in
through your solar plexus and up to the middle cauldron at
the level of your heart. As you breathe out, imagine the caul-
dron filled and surrounded by golden sunlight. Repeat this

**_196_** Part Two: The Practice of Druid Magic


process, drawing the solar current into the cauldron on the
inbreath and letting it radiate there on the outbreath, nine
times in all. Then say, “I thank Spirit Above for its gifts.”
Go on to the invocation of Spirit Within. Be aware of
yourself, with the two cauldrons shining inside you and the
six powers invoked and present around you. Say words like
these: “By the six powers here invoked and here present, and
in the grand word Awen _,_ I invoke Spirit Within. May the
lunar current be born in me this day and always. May the
cauldron of the Moon be filled within me.” Breathe in, and
imagine silvery light rising straight up the midline of your
body from the cauldron of the earth. As it reaches the caul-
dron of the Sun,it blends with the golden light there, and a
stream of mixed silver-gold light rises the rest of the way to
the cauldron of the Moon and flows into it. On the out-
breath,the light in the cauldron of the Moon turns into pure
white radiance, filling and surrounding the cauldron.
Repeat this process, drawing light up from the two
lower cauldrons on the inbreath and converting it to white
radiance on the outbreath, nine times in all. Then imagine a
drop of pure white light falling from the cauldron of the
Moon all the way to your solar plexus, halfway between the
two lower cauldrons. Once there, it expands out in all direc-
tions to become the sphere of light used in the Circulation of
Light, and you proceed as usual. Once you finish the Sphere
of Protection, take your seat in the grove and meditate on
the three cauldrons for a time. When you are ready, close in
the usual way.

**_The Three Cauldrons Exercise_**
This ritual need be performed only once to start the process
of establishing and filling the three cauldrons. Once you
have done the ritual, however, regular work with the three

The Secret of the Grail **_197_**


cauldrons should become part of your daily magical prac-
tice, so that you can build on the foundations the ritual puts
in place. Do the exercise as follows.
First, perform the Elemental Cross as usual, then invoke
and banish the elements of air, fire, water, and earth in the
usual way. When you begin the invocation of Spirit Below,
trace the orange circle as usual and say words like these: “By
the bright heart of the Earth Mother, and in the great name
Ced,I invoke Spirit Below, its gods, its spirits, and its pow-
ers. May a ray of the telluric current ascend into me this day
and always. May the cauldron of the earth be filled within
me.” Breathe in telluric nwyfre up through the soles of your
feet and lead it into the cauldron three times. Then say, “I
thank Spirit Belowfor its gifts.”
Go on to the invocation of Spirit Above in the usual way.
Trace the purple circle and say words like these: “By the Sun
in its glory, the father of light, and in the great name Celi, I
invoke Spirit Above, its gods, its spirits, and its powers. May
a ray of the solar current descend into me this day and always.
May the cauldron of the Sun be filled within me.” Breathe
solar nwyfre in through your solar plexus and up to the caul-
dron of the Sun three times, then say, “I thank Spirit Above
for its gifts.”
Go on next to the invocation of Spirit Within, and say
words like these: “By the six powers here invoked and here
present, and in the grand word Awen, I invoke Spirit Within.
May the lunar current be born in me this day and always.
May the cauldron of the Moon be filled within me.” Breathe
telluric nwyfre up from the cauldron of the earth,combine
it with solar nwyfre from the cauldron of the Sun, and bring
the combined currents up to fill the cauldron of the Moon
three times. Then perform the circulation of light as usual.

**_198_** Part Two: The Practice of Druid Magic


If you find yourself in a situation where you can’t per-
form the Sphere of Protection for some reason, an even sim-
pler version of the Three Cauldrons exercise can be done.
Simply call a ray of light down from high above you, as in the
beginning of the Elemental Cross, and send it down to the
center of the Earth. Then imagine the cauldron of the earth
in your belly and draw telluric nwyfre into it three times
with three inbreaths, as in the ritual. Imagine the cauldron of
the Sun in your chest, and draw solar nwyfre into it three
times with three inbreaths. Imagine the cauldron of the Moon
in your head, and bring the currents up the midline of your
body to it with three inbreaths. Finally, perform the circula-
tion of light.This version should not be used often, since it
lacks the balancing effect of the elemental invocations, but it
works well in a pinch.

**The Rising Dragons**
The next phase of the Inner Grail working draws its imagery
from a Celtic tradition of the Middle Ages. Two of the earli-
est accounts of King Arthur, the ninth-century _History of the
Britons_ by Nennius and the twelfth-century _History of the
Kings of Britain_ by Geoffrey of Monmouth, both include
detailed references to it, and a different version appears in a
tale in the _Mabinogion,_ the story of Lludd and Llefelys.
As Nennius and Geoffrey tell it, the wicked British king
Vortigern wished to build a stronghold in the mountains of
northern Wales, but the stones his workmen put up each day
fell down again each night. He summoned his wizards and
asked them for advice, and they told him that the stronghold
would stand if the blood of a child without a father was mixed
into the mortar. Vortigern sent messengers throughout his

The Secret of the Grail **_199_**


kingdom, and they found a boy from the town of Caer-
marthen whose mother swore she had been made pregnant
by no man. Nennius calls the boy Emrys, while Geoffrey
gives him his more famous name: Merlin.
When Merlin came before Vortigern, however, the boy-
wizard immediately took control of the situation. When he
heard about the collapsing fortress and the wizards’ advice,
he told Vortigern to summon his wizards, and he demanded
that they explain why the stronghold kept falling down.
When they admitted they had no idea, Merlin told the king
to have his workmen dig down beneath the building site, and
predicted they would find an underground lake with two
containers—vases in Nennius, hollow stones in Geoffrey—
containing two serpents or dragons.
The workmen dug down and found the lake, then
drained the lake and discovered the containers and the drag-
ons just as Merlin predicted. Once uncovered, the dragons
awoke and struggled against each other. At that moment,
according to Geoffrey, Merlin burst into tears, entered a
prophetic trance, and spoke the Prophecies of Merlin, a text
as famous in the Middle Ages as the prophecies of
Nostradamus are today.
R. J. Stewart, one of the most insightful modern inter-
preters of the Merlin legend, pointed out in his 1986 book
_The Prophetic Vision of Merlin_ that the rising dragons and
Merlin’s breakthrough into prophetic vision appear together
for good reason. The dragons represent creative energies
present within the land and every human being as well, and
when these energies awaken and rise up through the body,
they bring magical gifts of wisdom and power. This same
imagery appears in the teachings of several traditional Druid

**_200_** Part Two: The Practice of Druid Magic


orders as well, for the rising of the two dragons forms the
basis of one of the most potent exercises in Druid magic.
The principle behind the exercise appears in veiled form
in the old Grail legends, and can also be found written in the
landscape at Glastonbury, where tradition claims the Grail
had its hiding place. Two mineral springs flow near the flank
of Glastonbury Tor, one flowing with red water, the other
with white. These same colors appear over and over again in
the Grail legends,often in the formof two lesser vessels
holding the sweat and blood of Jesus, or some other pair of
white and red fluids.The roses and lilies, red lions and white
stags, red kings and white queens who appear so often
among the symbols of alchemy point to the same thing.
It takes only a little familiarity with the language of myth
to recognize that the Grail and the white and red fluids mean
exactly the same thing as the underground lake and white
and red dragons revealed by Merlin, or the alchemical vessel
in which the red king and white queen embrace. The Grail,
as we have seen, is present whenever the solar and telluric
currents fuse and the lunar current is born.Yet the Grail is a
vessel,a container,and the power that fills it comes from
three sources.The first is the solar current, descending from
above into the open mouth of the Grail in the form of the
holy spear that appears alongside the sacred cup in the leg-
end. The other two come from the land itself.
The solar and telluric currents, as mentioned back in
chapter 1, give rise to two secondary currents, the red and
white dragons of the legend.When these rise through the
three cauldrons forming the Grail, they charge the cauldrons
and strengthen them and their effects dramatically, awaken-
ing subtle perceptions and powers within the self. They also

The Secret of the Grail **_201_**


help keep the solar and telluric currents in balance within the
vessel of the Grail.You can awaken the dragon currents in the
same way as the three cauldrons, with a ritual working fol-
lowed by a daily exercise linked to the Sphere of Protection.

**_The Rising Dragons Ritual_**
Like the Three Cauldrons ritual, the following ritual need
only be done once, though the flows of nwyfre it establishes
must be strengthened through regular practice of a simpler
exercise afterward. It should not be performed until you
have the three cauldrons solidly established in your imaginal
body, a process that usually takes four to six weeks of daily
practice. If you performed the Cauldron ritual on one of the
eight holy days, it often works well to perform the Two
Dragons ritual on the holy day following. If you have any
doubts,cast an Ogham reading to settle the matter, just as
though you were planning any other magical working.
Once you are ready for the working, prepare for a stan-
dard grove ritual, with wand, cauldron, and crane bag pres-
ent, and open the grove in the usual way. When you invoke
the four material elements,ask each element to assist you in
awakening the power of the two dragons in yourself, and
banish all obstacles to your success in the working.When you
reach the invocations of spirit, go on as though you were
doing your usual Three Cauldrons exercise, breathing
nwyfre into each cauldron three times.
When you finish this stage, turn your attention to the
heavens high above you. As you draw in a breath, imagine a
ray of light streaming straight down from above you. It
passes through the center of your head and through each of
the cauldrons, and as you breathe out, it continues down to
the center of the Earth.This is the holy spear, descending

**_202_** Part Two: The Practice of Druid Magic


into the Grail to restore fertility to the land, and it also rep-
resents the rays of the Sun falling on the underground lake
beneath Vortigern’s tower. Repeat this same image a total of
nine times, on nine breaths.
Then clasp your hands over your cauldron of Earth, an
inch below your navel, and hold your elbows a little out and
rounded. Make sure your knees are slightly bent and your
weight rests equally on both feet. These details of posture
help guide the currents through your enaid and physical
body along the proper paths.
Next,turn your attention to the earth below your feet.
Reach deep into the Earth with your imagination, and pic-
ture the heart of the Earth ablaze with light. From that
deep source of light, imagine two currents of nwyfre rising
up, one red and one white, like twin serpents or dragons.
The red one rises until its head is just belowthe sole of
your right foot, and the white to just below the sole of your
left foot.
Next, bring the red current up through your right leg
and the white current through your left leg, and draw them
into your cauldron of the earth.The two currents cross there,
so that the white current flows to your right side and the red
to your left. They flow into your arms, curve out and then
back in,and flow into your cauldron of the Sun. Here they
cross again, so that the red is again on the right and the white
on the left.The two currents arc up the sides of your head and
neck and flow into your cauldron of the Moon. Here they
fuse in a blaze of pure light,as shown in Figure 7-2.
Repeat this upward motion of the two currents nine
times in all. It often works best to take two breaths in the
course of each upward movement—breathing in as the cur-
rents flow up your legs to the cauldron of the earth; out as

The Secret of the Grail **_203_**


they flow out and back inwards to the cauldron of the Sun;
in again as they flow out and back inwards to the cauldron of
the Moon;out again as they fuse and fill the cauldron of the
Moon with blinding light. If you need to take more breaths,
however, by all means do so. The goal of the ritual is to get
the imagery and flow of the rising dragons firmly estab-
lished, not to get it done quickly.
When the dragons have risen to your cauldron of the
Moon nine times, go on to the Circulation of Light as usual.
Take your seat in the grove, and meditate on the two drag-
ons,then close.If you feel dizzy,as many people do after this

**_204_** Part Two: The Practice of Druid Magic

**Figure 7-2 The Two Dragon Currents**


ritual, eat something to bring yourself back down to the
material world.

**_The Rising Dragons Exercise_**
Once you perform the Rising Dragons ritual as described, a
simpler working can be used to build on the foundations
established by the ritual.The exercise expands further on the
Sphere of Protection, and is done as follows.
Begin as usual with the Elemental Cross, and invoke and
banish the elements of air, fire, water, and earth in the stan-
dard way. Then invoke the elements of Spirit Below, Spirit
Above, and Spirit Within to fill the three cauldrons, just as
you did in the Three Cauldrons exercise.
Next, as in the ritual, imagine a ray of the solar current
descending from infinitely far above you, passing through the
three cauldrons and into the center of the Earth beneath
you. Repeat this image three times in all.
Then clasp your hands over your cauldron of Earth, and
imagine the dragon currents rising from the heart of the
Earth to the soles of your feet. Bring them spiraling up
through your body,using the same breathing pattern as in
the ritual. Do this three times in all, and then perform the
Circulation of Light as usual.
If you find yourself in a situation where you can’t per-
form the Sphere of Protection for some reason, an even sim-
pler version of the Rising Dragons exercise can be done.
Simply call a ray of light down from high above you, as in the
beginning of the Elemental Cross,and send it down to the
center of the Earth. Next, establish the three cauldrons in
the usual way and breathe nwyfre into each cauldron three
times. After that, imagine the descending spear of light three

The Secret of the Grail **_205_**


times, and then bring the dragon currents up three times in
the way just outlined, and finish with the Circulation of
Light. As with the simplified Three Cauldrons exercise, this
shouldn’t be done too often because it lacks the balance of
the material elements, but it works well when waving your
arms around isn’t an option.

**The Tree of Light**
The third and final phase of the Inner Grail working unfolds
from a symbolism found all over the world. Many traditional
mythologies picture the world as a mighty tree with its roots
in the underworld,its branches holding the worlds in place,
and its crown reaching up to the highest realms of spirit. It’s
a powerful image and, like all myths, it can be understood on
many different levels. It has obvious relevance to Druid
magic, because trees draw their life from above and below at
the same time—their roots bring up minerals and water
from deep within the Earth, while their leaves soak up sun-
light and carbon dioxide from the heavens—just as Druid
magic draws power from both the solar and telluric currents
(see Figure 7-3).
The image of the world tree also has potent links to the
lore of spiritual transformation. Countless myths of the
attainment of wisdom include the world tree as a central fea-
ture. The Norse wizard god Odin hanging on the world tree
Yggdrasil for nine nights to win the secret of the runes, and
Gautama the Buddha achieving nirvana while seated at the
foot of the Bo tree,are two examples.Another example,
though it’s not often recognized as one, is the crucifixion of
Jesus. The _Gospel of Truth,_ one of the Gnostic gospels, says of
Jesus:“He was nailed to a tree and he became a fruit of the
knowledge [gnosis] of the Father” (Robinson, 1988, p. 41).

**_206_** Part Two: The Practice of Druid Magic


```
Many Gnostics,as this text shows,believed that Jesus
brought gnosis —the spiritual knowledge that transforms the
self—to humankind through his crucifixion. Like Odin, the
Buddha,and many other mythic figures,his self-surrender in
the presence of a tree won the gift of knowledge. The
Gnostics were not the only ones who pictured the cross as a
living tree,either—many medieval images of Jesus’ crucifix-
ion show the same unexpected image.
Like every other mythic image, this conjunction of the
tree, the holy person, and the gift of wisdom has many
meanings and lessons.The simple fact that sitting with your
back against a tree very often helps deepen your medita-
tions is not the least of them! Still, another meaning in this
```
```
The Secret of the Grail 207
```
**Figure 7-3 The World Tree**


combination of symbols has an important secret to teach the
Druid mage.
Some of the most insightful studies of tree symbolism,
such as E. A. S Butterworth’s _The Tree at the Navel of the Earth,_
suggest that these myths of revelation at the world tree relate
to one of the hidden potentials of the human enaid. Many
people nowadays have heard of kundalini yoga, the art of
rousing the “serpent power” at the base of the spine and lead-
ing it up to the crown of the head. This is one expression of
a widely known magical technique—the opening of a cen-
tral channel of nwyfre along the midline of the body.
Different magical and mystical systems use this channel
in many ways. Kundalini yoga opens the channel to bring
energy up from belowand awaken the seven chakras. The
Golden Dawn’s Middle Pillar exercise, by contrast, brings
nwyfre down the central channel from above, and uses it to
awaken five energy centers. The difference in technique
comesfrom the fact that these twosystems don’t draw
nwyfre from the same sources or work toward the same
goals. Each one does what it needs to do to reach the goals
it sets itself.The same can be said for the countless other tra-
ditions that use the central channel to direct nwyfre. In
Druid magic, as you’ve probably guessed already, the central
channel opens to a twofold flow of nwyfre from the macro-
cosm—upward from the telluric current and downward
from the solar current.
The process of opening the central channel actually
began with the very first gesture of the Sphere of Protection,
the first ritual you learned in this book,when you brought
down a ray of light from far above and sent it down into the
depths of the Earth. All the invocations of Spirit Above and
Below and the work with the solar and telluric currents took

**_208_** Part Two: The Practice of Druid Magic


the process further, and the first two stages of the Inner
Grail working brought it to a new level by establishing cen-
ters of nwyfre along your body’s centerline, and bringing the
two dragon currents into play to balance and sustain the cen-
tral channel.
The third stage of the Inner Grail working completes the
sequence by formulating the central channel anew and open-
ing it to the nwyfre of the macrocosm. As with the first two
stages,an initial ritual to establish the imagery needs to be
followed by regular practice with a simpler exercise. As you
work through these stages, the central channel will open
slowly and naturally. Methods of opening the central channel
in a hurry do exist,but these need to be learned under the
close supervision of an experienced teacher, and involve
substantial risks to your physical and mental health. A more
patient approach gets the same results,and can be followed
successfully from written instructions like these.

**_The Tree of Light Ritual_**
Like the rituals that began the first two phases of the Grail
working,the following ritual need only be done once,
though regular practice is just as important once you per-
formit. Before you attempt it, be sure you have the two
dragon currents well established in your imaginal body, a
process that usually takes four to six weeks of daily practice.
If you performed the Rising Dragons Ritual on one of the
eight holy days, it often works well to perform the Tree of
Light ritual on the holy day following. As before, cast an
Ogham reading to be sure you are ready.
Prepare for a standard grove ritual, with wand, caul-
dron, and crane bag present, and open the grove in the usual
way. When you invoke the four material elements, ask each

The Secret of the Grail **_209_**


element to assist you in bringing the Tree of Light into being
in yourself, and banish all obstacles to your success in the
working. When you reach the invocations of spirit, go on as
though you were doing your usual Three Cauldrons and Ris-
ing Dragons exercises, breathing nwyfre into each cauldron
three times, and then bringing the dragon currents up
through the cauldrons three times.
At this point in the working, imagine a point of light de-
scending from your cauldron of the Moon to your solar
plexus center, as though you were about to begin the Circu-
lation of Light. Instead of expanding it into a sphere, though,
hold it at your solar plexus center for a time, imagining it as
a seed.Let the seed of light sprout, sending a slender stem
of light upward and a root of light downward.Watch it grow
into a sapling, and then into a tree, putting out branches and
leaves of light above you and roots of light below. Feel sun-
light and wind on the leaves, soil and water around the roots,
the firmness of the trunk connecting them.Spend as much
time as you need to make the image of the tree as clear and
solid as possible.
Next,turn your attention to your breath.As you breathe
in, imagine the leaves drawing in air, sunlight, and the
nwyfre of the solar current, and sending them down through
the trunk all the way to the deepest root. As you breathe out,
imagine the roots drawing in water, nutrients from the soil,
and the nwyfre of the telluric current, and sending them
through the trunk all the way to the highest leaf. Repeat this
nine times in all.
Finally,turn your attention back to your solar plexus,
and imagine that the seed of light is still there, in the heart
of the Tree of Light. Expand it into a sphere as usual, making
the sphere large enough to surround the entire Tree of Light,

**_210_** Part Two: The Practice of Druid Magic


and then perform the Circulation of Light as you usually do.
Take your seat in the grove and meditate on the image of the
Tree of Light. When you are ready, close the grove in the
ordinary way.

**_The Tree of Light Exercise_**
The Tree of Light exercise builds on your previous daily rit-
ual practices—the Sphere of Protection, Three Cauldrons
exercise, and Rising Dragons exercise—and includes all of
these. Plan on practicing it regularly from the time you per-
formthe Tree of Light ritual, for as long as you choose to fol-
low the path of Druid magic.
Begin by performing the Elemental Cross as usual, and
invoke and banish the elements of air, fire, water, and earth
in the standard way. Next, invoke the elements of Spirit
Below,Spirit Above, and Spirit Within to fill the three caul-
drons, just as you did in the Three Cauldrons exercise. Bring
the ray of solar light down from above to the center of the
Earth, summon the two dragon currents and bring them up
through your body and the three cauldrons, just as you did
in the Rising Dragons exercise.
Then, let a seed of light descend from your cauldron of
wisdom to your solar plexus center, and imagine the Tree of
Light growing from that seed until it extends far above and
below you. Once the tree is established, bring the solar cur-
rent down to the roots on each inbreath, and bring the tel-
luric current up to the leaves on each outbreath. Repeat this
three times in all.Finish by performing the Circulation of
Light as usual.
Regular practice of this exercise, once you have worked
your way through the rituals and exercises leading up to it,
will open door after door to your magical and spiritual

The Secret of the Grail **_211_**


advancement. As your practice ripens, so will your ability to
sense and shape nwyfre and work magic in yourself and the
world around you.This ripening process will bring you to an
inescapable challenge. Now that you hold the keys to magi-
cal power, what will you do with them?

**_212_** Part Two: The Practice of Druid Magic


## Part Three The Way of Druid Magic



## Chapter 8 The Reenchantment of the World

The question of the purposes of magic becomes more and
more necessary to confront as you progress further in ma-
gic. As with all things magical, different people and tradi-
tions answer it differently.To some, magic is a practical craft,
and its purpose is to make life happier and better for the
mage and his or her family, friends, and clients. To others,
magic is a path of service, and its purpose is to serve the
community, the gods, or the living Earth. To still others,
magic is a way of mystical transformation, and its purpose is
to lift the mage above the ordinary limitations of human-
ity—in the words of the old Druid lore, to pass from Abred,
the world of limitation and mortality, into Gwynfydd, the
realm of freedom and conscious immortality.
Many of the traditions that affirm one of these goals con-
demn the others for one reason or another.The Druid tradi-
tion, as you have probably guessed by now, takes a different
tack. From a Druid perspective, all of these are valid pur-
poses, and one of the tasks you face is the discovery of what-
ever blending of these purposes fulfills your own deepest
needs.You may find yourself called to one of the three alone,
or to a combination of two of them, or to some fusion of all
three. Since each created being is unique, and fills a unique


niche in the great pattern of all things, no one rule will work
for all.
The techniques and tools of Druid magic that you have
learned in this book can be used for any of these purposes, or
all of them.You are also free to draw on lore from other mag-
ical traditions as you create your own personal approach to
Druid magic, and you will find that magic from many other
systems can be integrated with the methods taught in this
book.Most of the possible purposes of magical work have
been covered at great length in recent magical literature.
One of the central themes of modern Druid magic,
however, rarely appears in other occult books. This theme
unfolds from points made in the first chapter of this book.
When Max Weber spoke more than a century ago of the dis-
enchantment of the world, he pointed to one of the greatest
needs of the present age of the world.If the modern indus-
trial world is literally disenchanted—suffering from a short-
age of enchantment,a loss of the magic that once wove
humanity and nature together into a single fabric—then one
of the crucial tasks of mages today is nothing less than the
reenchantment of the world.
Enchantment, as you learned in chapter 1, is the art of
awakening spiritual forces in material things. Before the
dawn of industrial society, and even today in cultures where
modern materialist ways of thought have not shouldered
aside older and wiser ways of relating to the living world, en-
chantment was and is part of everyday reality. Enchantment
played an essential role in balancing the rights of the individ-
ual with the needs of the community,keeping human actions
within ecological limits, and weaving humanity and nature
together into a single fabric.

**_216_** Part Three: The Way of Druid Magic


It’s popular nowadays, especially among apologists for
modern industrial culture, to speak of these enchantments as
“superstitions” or “taboos,” but such terms conceal both the
power of the old enchantments of nature and their ecologi-
cal relevance. All over the world, traditional enchantments
protected sacred groves from the axe, made certain areas off
limits to farming, herding, or hunting, and kept other inter-
actions between humanity and nature within precise limits.
Time and again,when ecologists have studied these old
“superstitions,” they have been astonished to find solid envi-
ronmental common sense underlying them—sacred groves
commonly grow in the right spots to prevent soil erosion,
animal species forbidden to hunters turn out to harbor dan-
gerous diseases, and so on.
Those modern scholars who notice the ecological reali-
ties behind these enchantments very often claim that their
magical dimension is either a symbolic way of talking about
wholly material phenomena, or a way of tricking people into
behaving the way they should. Magical philosophy suggests
another alternative.The enchanted world of traditional soci-
eties establishes an intentionality that helps make people
aware of their place in a larger community, rewards those
who walk in harmony with nature, and corrects those who
refuse to do so. The loss of the old enchantments thus does
much to explain the blind arrogance that drives modern
industrial society from one preventable ecological disaster to
another.
According to magical lore,however, the web of enchant-
ments that unites humanity with the land has effects on non-
human nature as well. Human cooperation with the cycles of
nature, old traditions teach, brings balance and fertility to

The Reenchantment of the World **_217_**


the natural world. This makes perfect sense in magical
terms. Since nwyfre follows intentionality, an intentionality
that brings human beings and nature into balance has posi-
tive results all through the ecosystem on every level. Just as
ignorant and arrogant human actions can create wastelands
out of forests, human actions guided by wisdom and a clear
sense of ecological reality can not only turn wastelands back
into thriving ecosystems but help nature flourish even more
abundantly than she does on her own.
Enchantments so potent take centuries to establish,
and—at least according to tradition—also need the con-
scious cooperation of other beings, ranging from animals
and plants through nature spirits to the great powers of the
cosmos that human beings call gods and goddesses. Even a
lifetime spent in Druid magic can only begin the process of
restoring the ancient web of enchantment. Still, no other
application of the art of magic has so much relevance to the
needs of today as the work of reawakening the enchantments
of the Grail and healing today’s Waste Land.The ritual work-
ings explored in this chapter provide several ways to begin
work on this great and profoundly necessary task.

**Cleansing the Land**
One of the most heartbreaking results of our society’s blind-
ness to its own roots in the living world is the casual devas-
tation inflicted on so many natural environments. Three
centuries into the Industrial Age, few corners of the Earth
have escaped damage from the discarded poisons,resource
extraction, and sheer careless waste of a civilization that
imagines it will not have to live with the consequences of its
mistreatment of its planetary home. Plenty of hard work of

**_218_** Part Three: The Way of Druid Magic


every kind, from tree planting and erosion control to changes
in attitudes, will be needed to repair the damage and stop
any more from occurring.
Magic has a role to play, however, because patterns in the
nwyfre can shape human and nonhuman actions alike, speed-
ing the healing of the land while it helps shelter recovering
ecosystems from further damage. By the time you begin
exploring the rituals in this chapter, if you have worked your
way through the earlier sections of this book, you know that
magic can have remarkable effects on your own life, even in
its most practical dimensions. Magic can do the same thing
for natural ecosystems. It cannot substitute for other forms
of work,but it can do things no other kind of work can do.
It can catalyze subtle changes in the Earth that can literally
speed up the breakdown of toxins in the soil and water, as
well as banishing the subtler toxins of ignorance,selfishness,
and greed that put the more material pollutants there in the
first place.
The choice of a place to cleanse is of some importance.
The influence of the media leads many people to think of
nature as something that only matters in wilderness areas
and national parks, and so many people who want to use
magic to help the natural world focus on a handful of famous
places and neglect opportunities much closer to home.
Nature is a complex web, however, and many times the
places that most need cleansing and healing lie scarcely
noticed on the fringes of industrial society: a vacant lot over-
grown with weeds where local birds nest, a neglected marsh
critical for the spawning cycles of a rare species of fish, a
patch of woodland where animals find homes among aban-
doned cars and decades-old junk. Such places form what
ecologists call _refugia,_ small patches of living nature from

The Reenchantment of the World **_219_**


which recovery can take place as the ravages of industrial civ-
ilization draw to an end, and they call for at least as much care
and healing as more famous and photogenic places far away.
Another cautionary note belongs here. Many people in
the modern alternative spirituality movement, seeing the di-
lapidated state of many ancient sacred sites, decide that the
best starting point for the reenchantment of the world is the
nearest holy place they can find. It is hard to think of a less
constructive notion. Many places made sacred by the an-
cients still possess a magic far subtler and stronger than any-
thing in the fragmentary occult teachings that are all we have
to work with today.Trying to repair a holy place on the basis
of the material in this book is a little like trying to perform
brain surgery using a first-aid textbook as your guide.
This is especially true in regions such as North America
and Australia,where the people who built the sacred sites
have been driven off their lands and confined to reservations
by European invaders in recent centuries. Many of the old
holy places are still visited and tended secretly by descen-
dants of the original builders, and ignorant magical work
done with no understanding of native traditions can do much
more harm than good. Unless you have been invited to help
cleanse a sacred site by a native elder who has the right to
make that invitation, then you have no business imposing
your magic in such a place.
As a general rule, the closer to home you start your per-
sonal contribution to the reenchantment of the world, the
more constructive good you will do. As you learn to notice
your own environment,you will find that there is no short-
age of places that need to be cleansed and blessed. Many
Druids find that their own backyards are a good starting
place for this work,and local spots where nature keeps a

**_220_** Part Three: The Way of Druid Magic


foothold make a good next step. Such steps may seem mod-
est at first glance, but when you wake to the sound of native
birdsong for the first time in years, or watch wildflowers
burst into life in what had been a patch of invasive weeds,
you will see that the results are well worth the effort.
The following ritual is one of many possible ways to use
magic to cleanse land and heal the damage done to it by
human neglect and mismanagement. Experiment with it,
and then create your own rituals for the same purpose.

**_A Land-Cleansing Ritual_**
Before you begin ritual work, all the usual preliminaries
need to be done first.Meditate on your intention and cast an
Ogham divination to be sure your intention is appropriate.
It can also be wise to use scrying to explore the options
before beginning ritual work;simply use a mental image of
the place itself as a doorway for scrying, and ask to speak to
the spirits of the place.Tell them what you have in mind, and
ask them if they approve. If they do, ask them if they have any
requests or advice concerning the ritual, and act accord-
ingly if they do.You will find that the information you get in
this way can increase the positive effects of this work in dra-
matic ways.
This ritual is best done in the open air, standing on the
piece of land you seek to cleanse and bless. If circumstances
make this impossible, do the ritual in a private place as close
as possible to the place to be cleansed. In this latter case, take
a stone or a small handful of earth from the place to be
cleansed, and put it in the center of the altar before you
begin. You will also need the four cauldrons for incense,
flame, water, and earth, as well as your wand. Open the
grove with the cauldrons in the usual way.

The Reenchantment of the World **_221_**


When you perform the Sphere of Protection, call on the
elements to bless the land with their power, and take away
any pollution or damage from the land. When you finish the
opening and take your seat, use green color breathing to pre-
pare for the meditation, and then meditate on the idea of
cleansing and purifying the land.
When you are ready, rise and approach the altar. Say
words like these: “I invoke the power of Ced, the Earth
Mother to heal and bless this land. Let all pollution depart
from it and all damage be healed. Let it and all the living
things that depend on it be restored to radiant health.” If you
cannot perform the ritual on the land itself, change the
wording of this and all other parts of the ritual to refer to the
land you intend to cleanse, rather than the place where you
are performing the working.
Circle around to the east side of the altar,facing the cen-
ter, and say, “Let the powers of air arise and cleanse this
place.”Pick up the cauldron of incense, take it to the eastern
edge of the place, and raise it high in both hands. Say words
like these: “In the name of Hu and by the powers of the realm
of air I cleanse this land and call the powers of healing to it.”
Concentrate on the idea that the incense smoke is summon-
ing cleansing winds to bring healing to the land. When it
feels right, return the cauldron to the altar.
Circle around to the south side of the altar, facing the cen-
ter, and say: “Let the powers of fire arise and cleans this place.”
Pick up the fire cauldron, take it to the southern edge of the
place, and raise it high in both hands. Say words like these: “In
the name of Sul and by the powers of the realm of fire I cleanse
this land and call the powers of healing to it.” Concentrate on
the idea that the heat of the flame is summoning cleansing sun-

**_222_** Part Three: The Way of Druid Magic


light and warmth to bring healing to the land. When it feels
right, return the cauldron to the center of the altar.
Circle around to the west side of the altar, facing the
center, and say, “Let the powers of water arise and cleanse
this place.” Pick up the water cauldron, take it to the west-
ern edge of the place, and raise it high in both hands. Say
words like these: “In the name of Esus and by the powers of
the realm of water I cleanse this land and call the powers of
healing to it.”Concentrate on the idea that the water is sum-
moning cleansing rains and flowing water to bring healing to
the land.When it feels right, return the cauldron to the cen-
ter of the altar.
Circle around to the north side of the altar, facing the
center, and say, “Let the powers of earth arise and cleanse
this place.” Pick up the earth cauldron, take it to the north-
ern edge of the place,and raise it high in both hands.Say
words like these: “In the name of Elen and by the powers of
the realm of earth I cleanse this land and call the powers of
healing to it.” Concentrate on the idea that the salt or earth
is summoning chemical processes in the earth to bring heal-
ing to the land.When it feels right,return the cauldron to
the center of the altar.
Turn your attention to the land beneath you, and imag-
ine the telluric current rising up from the heart of the Earth.
Say words like these: “When the four material elements are
in balance, the element of spirit appears in their midst.” Pick
up the wand, and use it to trace an invoking heather penta-
gram over the altar,saying, “I invoke Spirit Below. Let the
telluric current arise and bless this land.” Imagine silver light
rising up from the center of the Earth to fill the land and
every living thing on, in, and above it with vitality and

The Reenchantment of the World **_223_**


health. Make this image as vivid as possible, and maintain it
for at least several minutes before releasing it.
Release the image, then turn your attention to the sky
above you. Imagine the solar current cascading down
through space from the Sun. Pick up the wand and use it to
trace an invoking oak pentagram over the altar, saying words
like these: “I invoke Spirit Above. Let the solar current de-
scend and bless this land.” Imagine golden light descending
from the skies to fill the land and every living thing on, in,
and above it with vitality and health. Make this image as vivid
as possible, and maintain it for several minutes at least.
Hold the wand vertically with both hands above the altar,
in the middle of the space where you traced the two penta-
grams. Say words like these: “From above to below, from
below to above, the two currents are awakened. I in-
voke Spirit Within. Let the lunar current be born within this
land and fill it with the power of Awen.” Imagine the golden
solar current and the silver telluric current both shining into
the land at once, and then see them fuse into pure white light,
the color of lightning. Imagine the disk of the Moon surround-
ing the land and everything in it.Once again,make this image
as vivid as possible, and hold it for several minutes at least.
Once this is done, close the grove in the usual way. If you
have done the working somewhere other than the place you
intend to cleanse and bless, take the stone or earth that has
been at the center of the altar and return it to the place where
the effects of the working are meant to focus. The material
link will help anchor the energies to the proper place.
As with any working,the best way to anchor the effects
of the magic in the material world is to do something prac-
tical to further your intention. For this type of working, you
might choose to get sturdy gloves and a trash bag or two, and

**_224_** Part Three: The Way of Druid Magic


pick up all the litter you can find on the piece of land you
have worked magic to heal. If circumstances make this sort
of direct action impossible, a change in your own life to sig-
nificantly reduce the burden your lifestyle places on the liv-
ing Earth will have the same positive effects.

**Restoring Fertility to the Land**
One of the classic purposes for magical ritual is to bring fer-
tility to the land, and this is even more necessary today than
it once was. Once the basic work of cleaning and healing has
been done, the restoration of natural fertility forms a second
vital step,and magic can accomplish this at a level of sub-
tlety and power no other human action can manage.
In ancient times, when wild ecosystems thrived in bal-
ance with their surroundings and human beings were still
struggling to master the subtle magic of agriculture, most
such rituals aimed at bringing fertility to the fields and gar-
dens on which human life depended. Nowadays, by contrast,
it is difficult to find any place on the Earth’s surface that has
not been affected by human mismanagement, and magical
workings to restore fertility are needed just as much in the
wilderness as in places harmed by industrial agriculture or
ecologically ignorant landscaping.
In magical terms, fertility comes into being from the
fusion of the solar and telluric currents.When land becomes
barren, the contact between the two currents has become
blocked and needs to be reestablished. The traditions of
Druid magic offer several different ways to restore the free
flow of the two currents.
Perhaps the simplest and most inconspicuous way to do
this draws on the ritual work you have already learned. The

The Reenchantment of the World **_225_**


Inner Grail working, like any magical working, sets up mo-
mentum in the nwyfre in the place where it is performed.
Since it draws on the solar and telluric currents and creates
the lunar current from them, it fosters the fusion of the cur-
rents in nature. When circumstances don’t allow you to do
ritual work openly, simply sit or stand in the area you intend
to affect and do the simplest version of the complete Inner
Grail exercise given in chapter 7, including the Three Caul-
drons, the Dragon Currents, and the World Tree. Repeat this
as often as you can, concentrating on the idea that this work-
ing brings fertility to the land.
Another simple and effective way to restore fertility to an
area is to plant a tree, and water and tend the sapling until it
can grow by itself.Trees have important magical and energetic
properties over and above their contributions to the material
side of an ecosystem.The vertical line of the trunk becomes a
channel through which solar and telluric currents flow and
interact. _The Druidry Handbook_ includes information on plant-
ing trees and a simple ritual for blessing a newly planted tree,
and these can be valuable resources for any effort to restore
fertility to a place where it has become blocked.
Where circumstances permit, however, a stronger magic
with deep roots in Druid tradition can be put to use. This
begins with setting up a standing stone in the affected area to
serve as a channel for the two currents and a vessel for the
creation of the lunar current.The stone need not be large—
I have seen good results come from a stone only 18 inches
tall—but it should be no more than half as wide as it is tall,
and needs to be natural stone;concrete or other artificial
substances are worse than useless. A third of the stone’s
length should be underground, and two thirds above, as
shown in Figure 8-1.

**_226_** Part Three: The Way of Druid Magic


Once the stone is in place,it will begin forming a con-
nection between the solar and telluric currents all by itself.
You can make this process work more swiftly and power-
fully with magical ritual.The following ritual shows one way
this can be done, using the formula of the Inner Grail work-
ing. Experiment with it, learn its lessons, and then devise
your own rituals for the same purpose.

**_A Standing Stone Working_**
This working is best done between Imbolc and Alban
Heruin, to take advantage of the rising strength of the solar
current. For best results, schedule it on a morning between
dawn and noon, on a day when the Moon is waxing. As with
any working, you should meditate on your intention and cast
an Ogham reading beforehand to be sure your plans are
appropriate, and scrying is also a valuable tool for this work.

andone third beneath

```

Set up the space for an ordinary grove ritual, with the
four cauldrons of the elements placed around the stone as
though on an altar, and a chair in the north. Open the grove
in the usual way, using the cauldrons in place of your wand.
When you purify the space with the four elements and bring
each cauldron back to the center, purify the stone as well by
making a circle around it with each element. When you cast
the Sphere of Protection, ask the four material elements to
help you bring fertility to the land, and banish everything
that hinders fertility there.
When you reach the invocations of the three forms of
spirit, the distinctive phase of this ritual begins. When you
invoke Spirit Below, trace the orange circle over the stone
and say words like these: “By the bright heart of the Earth
Mother, and in the great name Ced, I invoke Spirit Below, its
gods,its spirits,and its powers. May a ray of the telluric cur-
rent ascend into this stone now and always.” Imagine the tel-
luric current rising up from the depths of the Earth into the
stone, filling it with silvery light that ripples like water.
Concentrate on this for several minutes at least. Then say, “I
thank Spirit Belowfor its gifts.”
Go on to the invocation of Spirit Above, trace the purple
circle in the air above the stone, and say words like these: “By
the Sun in its glory, the father of light, and in the great name
Celi,I invoke Spirit Above, its gods, its spirits, and its pow-
ers. May a ray of the solar current descend into this stone
now and always.” Imagine the solar current descending from
the sky into the stone, filling it with golden sunlight. Con-
centrate on this for several minutes at least.Then say, “ I
thank Spirit Above for its gifts.”
Go on to the invocation of Spirit Within. Say words like
these:“By the six powers here invoked and here present, and

**_228_** Part Three: The Way of Druid Magic


in the grand word _Awen,_ I invoke Spirit Within. May the lunar
current be born in this stone now and always.” Imagine the
silver and gold nwyfre within the stone fusing into pure
white radiance and radiating outward into the ground.
Concentrate on this for several minutes at least.
When you finish this stage, turn your attention to the hea-
vens high above you. Imagine a ray of light streaming straight
down from above the stone, passing through it and descend-
ing down to the center of the Earth. This brings the solar
current through the stone to heal any imbalances in the
nwyfre of the land. Concentrate on this image for several
minutes at least.
Next,turn your attention to the earth below your feet.
Reach deep into the Earth with your imagination, and pic-
ture the heart of the Earth ablaze with light. From that deep
source of light,imagine two currents of nwyfre rising up,
one red and one white, like twin serpents or dragons. The
red one is to your right, the white one to your left. The two
currents cross just below the stone, then again at the mid-
point of the stone, and finally unite just above the stone in a
blaze of pure light.Again,concentrate on this image for sev-
eral minutes at least.
Next,imagine a point of light in the heart of the stone,
where the two dragon currents cross. Imagine it as a seed.
Let the seed of light sprout, sending a slender stem of light
upward and a root of light downward. Watch it grow into a
sapling, and then into a tree, putting out branches and leaves
of light above the stone and roots of light below. Feel sun-
light and wind on the leaves, soil and water around the roots,
the firmness of the trunk connecting them. Spend as much
time as you need to make the image of the tree as clear and
solid as possible.

The Reenchantment of the World **_229_**


Next, imagine the leaves drawing in air, sunlight, and the
nwyfre of the solar current, and sending them down through
the trunk all the way to the deepest root. Imagine the roots
drawing in water, nutrients from the soil, and the nwyfre of
the telluric current, and sending them through the trunk all
the way to the highest leaf. This is the most important phase
of the working, and you should concentrate on it for several
minutes at least, with as much intensity as you can.
Finally, turn your attention back to the stone. Imagine a
sphere of light expanding outward from the stone until it en-
closes the entire area you wish to bless with fertility. Per-
form the Circulation of Light as you usually do.Take your seat
in the grove and meditate on the image of the Tree of Light.
When you are ready, close the grove in the ordinary way.
This working may be repeated once a year to increase its
effect,preferably on the same date you originally performed
it. Repeated annual workings set up a rhythm in the nwyfre
that can yield spectacular results.

**Consecrating Sacred Spaces**
One further dimension of the Earth magic introduced in this
chapter deserves discussion here. While it is inappropriate
for anyone but experts and traditional elders to attempt
intensive magical work with ancient holy sites, nothing pre-
vents even a novice at Druid magic from creating a new
sacred place and working with its energies. Since the power
of the place will depend on your own skills as an enchanter,
you can be sure you will not get in over your depth,and as
your skills increase, so will the powers of the place you have
enchanted.

**_230_** Part Three: The Way of Druid Magic


A deeper issue also makes this a worthwhile option. In
our disenchanted world, sacred spaces are few and far be-
tween, while cultures that embrace the art of enchantment
and the holiness of nature usually create holy places all over
the landscape. It is precisely at sacred places, where spiri-
tual forces flow freely through the veils of matter, that the
enchantments that once held the world in balance can most
easily be rewoven; it is at sacred places where people can com-
municate most easily with the spiritual powers in nature, and
where the blessings of the gods and goddesses flow most eas-
ily into the world.
Even the humblest and simplest of sacred places can have
such effects.All over Japan today, for example, shrines dedi-
cated to the indigenous Japanese nature religion, Shinto, can
be found. Some of them are major religious sites with full-
time priests and priestesses,but many others are tiny pre-
cincts tucked in among houses or fields, visited by a traveling
priest once a year, or stones set up along roadsides and
marked only by a bit of carving and a few offerings. All of
them, the simple stones as well as the great centers, provide
contact points between people and the _kami,_ the spiritual po-
wers revered by Shinto. The same thing can be found all over
the world where the living traditions of nature-centered spir-
ituality have not been obliterated by the irrational “ration-
ality” of industrial culture.
Certain practical issues have to be considered in any at-
tempt to build sacred sites of the same kind here and now.
The most important is that once you enchant a sacred place,
it stays enchanted. According to some magical traditions, the
consecration of a holy place lasts for 2,160 years, or one of
the twelve astrological months of the Great Year, so you need

The Reenchantment of the World **_231_**


to plan ahead! For this reason among others, you should be
more than usually careful to be sure your intention is appro-
priate before beginning the work. Meditation and divination
both have their places in this process, but much can be
learned by simply sitting quietly in the place you hope to en-
chant, day after day, trying to feel the character of the space.
Ask the land if it wishes to become a sacred place, and listen
for the answer.
Traditionally each sacred place is under the guardianship
of a god or goddess, and making contact with the deity of the
place also forms part of the preliminary work. Whatever
spiritual practices you find most useful should be put to
work here. You may choose a deity for the place and then
seek the deity’s permission to dedicate the place to his or her
worship, or you may simply find a place that seeks enchant-
ment and then open yourself to whatever god or goddess de-
sires to manifest there. Both approaches are traditional and
effective,and whichever one fits your needs and the reli-
gious traditions you follow may be used. Since this dimension
of the work belongs to religion rather than magic, however,
no more will be said about it here.
The rituals you use to enchant your sacred space will
similarly depend on the religious traditions you follow and
the deity you intend to invoke. The magical side of the work
may be done using any of the rituals for enchantment pre-
sented in this book, or by way of an original ritual designed
to fit the details of the space and the purposes of the work-
ing. It often works well to open a grove in the usual way, per-
formthe magical side of the enchantment,then invoke the
god or goddess using whatever religious methods you prefer,
and close in the usual way after a time for meditation and
reflection.Once you enchant your holy place, whatever rit-

**_232_** Part Three: The Way of Druid Magic


uals you plan on doing there should begin as soon as possible
thereafter, but this again will depend on the work you have
in mind and the preferences of the deity you invoke.
A sacred space may also be enchanted through a series of
workings.This works particularly well if you plan on making
that classic Druid sacred space, a stone circle. One very
effective approach starts by selecting eight stones for the cir-
cle plus a ninth for the central altar. On one of the Druid
holy days, erect the stone corresponding to that day, and
enchant it using the standing stone ritual already given in this
chapter. On the next holy day, erect and enchant the next
stone, and so on around the wheel of the year. On the
anniversary of your placing the first stone, put in the altar
stone, and at that time invoke the deity who will be the
guardian of your stone circle. The result will be a powerful
ritual and spiritual space.On the other hand,you can erect
all the stones at once and enchant them one at a time as cir-
cumstances permit, and then use rituals performed regu-
larly in your stone circle to finish the process of enchanting
and empowering the place.
Beyond these fewguidelines,you will need to work out
your own approach to the art of crafting sacred space. If you
have worked your way through the rituals and exercises in
this book,you will have more than enough skill and experi-
ence to build and enchant a sacred space suited to your needs
and those of the spiritual powers you wish to invoke. As
industrial society moves further into its inevitable collision
with ecological reality,skills and experience of this kind
offer some of the few positive ways to bring humanity back
into harmony with the living earth and begin the process of
healing the damage that our species has caused over the last
few centuries. What part you choose to play in that great

The Reenchantment of the World **_233_**


work of Druid magic is up to you, for the Druid path offers
no simple answers, and each of us who walks that path does
so in a different way. May your journey bring joy to you and
blessing to the Earth!

### APPENDIX

### Deities in Welsh Druid Traditions

While many books currently available discuss the old Irish
pantheon, most accounts of the deities revered by Welsh and
English Druids in the nineteenth and early twentieth cen-
turies are long out of print.Since these gods and goddesses
are central to the Druid Revival tradition and play a major
role in Druid magic, an account of them may be useful to
Druids interested in the magical as well as the religious di-
mensions of Druidry.
It probably needs to be said that no solid evidence ties
most of these divinities or their worship back to the ancient
Celtic Druids. Modern Druidry traces its roots back only as
far as the eighteenth century;the Druid movement in Wales,
though it drew substantially on surviving fragments of me-
dieval Welsh lore, also relied, like every other living spiri-
tual tradition, on its own experiences and insights. Still,
historical authenticity is as irrelevant in matters of religion
as it is in magic.The consensus of many hundreds of modern
Druids is that the gods and goddesses of the Welsh Druid tra-
dition respond when they are invoked, and this is ultimately
the only thing that matters.
Many Neopagan traditions nowadays consider the mem-
bers of the three great families of Welsh myth—the Plant Don,
Plant Annwn,and Plant Llyr—to be gods and goddesses.In


the traditions discussed here, however, these beings belong
to a second order, superhuman but less mighty than the gods,
and subject to time and fate. Students of Platonism, a philos-
ophy much studied by nineteenth century Druids, may recall
the difference Plato notes in the _Timaeus_ between the eternal
gods and the created gods; a similar concept seems to have
shaped the theology of the Druid Revival.

**Ana**
The goddess of the planet Earth itself, as distinct from its
biosphere, Ana is the mother of Ced and the grandmother of
most of the other gods and goddesses; she rules the deep
places of the Earth. Imagine her as an ancient woman with
long white hair,dressed in dark robes of archaic design, with
a long staff in her hands and ornate rings on her fingers.

**Beli**
The year god who dies and is reborn at the winter solstice,
Beli traces out the cycle of the seasons as he passes through
the stages of his journey from pale infant to strong young
god,to lover and mate of the living Earth,to king,to sacri-
fice, to pale corpse laid out on the bier of the sky. Imagine
him at any of these stages, or more generally as a strong and
virile man with golden hair and beard, wearing a red tunic
and cloak ornamented with gold, and carrying a long spear
and a golden shield.

**Belinus**
Another name of Beli,chosen because its sevenletters in
their Greek form,bhlendz, add to 365—the number of
days in a year—in Greek gematria.

**_236_** Appendix


**Ced**
The goddess of the Earth’s biosphere, Ced is the primary fe-
male expression of the divine in Welsh Druid lore. Her name
means “bounty” or “assistance” in Welsh. She is the spouse
and equal of Celi the sky god, and also by turns the mother,
mate, and layer-out of Belinus at the various stages of his
yearly journey. Imagine her as a beautiful mature woman
with long flowing brown hair, wearing a green gown and a
cloak made of every kind of leaves.

**Celi**
The god of infinite space,Celi is the primary male expres-
sion of the divine in Welsh Druid lore. His name means “hea-
ven,” and he is also called Hen Ddihenydd, the Ancient of
Days. According to Welsh Druid tradition he is hidden from
human sight and only reveals himself as pure light. Imagine
him in the form of the three rays of light, /|\ , streaming
down from the heavens onto the Earth.

**Ceridwen**
The goddess of the Moon,Ceridwen—the name means “bent
woman,”and refers to the shape Americans call “the man in
the Moon” and Welsh tradition pictures as an old bent
woman bending over a cauldron—is the mistress of the
lunar current and the keeper of the secrets of Druid initia-
tion. Imagine her as an old woman with gray hair, clad in gar-
ments of red, white, and black, stirring a steaming cauldron.

**Coel**
The god of the life force, Coel is the earthly manifestation of
Celi, and has the additional role of god of wild animals and all

Appendix **_237_**


wilderness places.The fragmentary nursery rhyme about “Old
King Cole” seems to be a last dim scrap of folk memory of
this god, possibly filtered through stories of a sixth-century
British king named for him. Imagine him as a massively built
man with wild hair and beard, dressed as a huntsman in
russet and dark brown, with stag’s antlers rising from his
forehead.

**Elen**
The young goddess of dawn and springtime, Elen is also
associated with the dragon currents that flow through the
Earth and the old straight tracks that channel them. Her leg-
ends appear to be filtered through stories about a British
princess of the fourth century. She is also known as Niwalen
in her role as goddess of springtime greenery. Imagine her as
a maiden with golden hair,clad in a short white tunic, her
arms and legs bare, dancing in the forest.

**Esus**
The chief of tree spirits and guardian of the forests, Esus
derives his name (“lord”in Old Brythonic) from an old Gaul-
ish god, but his role in Druidry seems to have been a result
of nineteenth- and twentieth-century Druid visionaries. He
sits in the first fork of the sacred oak and teaches the lore of
trees to those who seek him out. Imagine him as a man of
indeterminate age seated in a tree, dressed in brown and
green garments that look like bark and leaves. His hands are
long, brown, and strong as roots, and his eyes are very
bright.

**Hesus**
Another name for Esus,containing the initial _H_ of Hu and
representing Esus as the protector and teacher of Druids.

**_238_** Appendix


**Hu**
The firstborn of Ced and Celi, Hu Gadarn (Hu the Mighty) is
the great Druid god, the master of the element of spirit in
all its forms. He is the owner of two even mightier oxen, the
“two calves of the Spotted Cow”; the “spotted cow” is the night
sky spotted with stars, and the two calves are the two
equinoxes that trudge implacably around the circle of heav-
en, driving the turning mill of time. Imagine him as a mature
man of immense strength with the horns of an ox curving up
from his broad forehead. His hair and beard are black, he
wears a robe of sky blue and a cloak as black as midnight, and
light streams from him.

**Niwalen**
Another name for Elen as goddess of springtime greenery.

**Og**
Another name for Beli as god of the year.

**Sul**
The daughter of the Sun god Beli,Sul is the goddess of the
threefold fire—the solar fire, the Sun; the telluric fire, the
heat within the Earth that warms healing hot springs; and the
common fire that blazes on every hearth. She is the mistress
of healing and of all domestic crafts. See her as an adult
woman with golden hair, wearing a white gown, red cloak,
and ornaments of gold.
