    <h3>Biographical/Historical note</h3>
    <p class="inv-1">The Hospital Association of the Teachers of the Public Schools of Detroit was conceived at a principals meeting held on October 1, 1901. Superintendent W. C. Martindale, briefly outlined a plan by which it would be possible for the teachers of the public schools of Detroit to endow rooms in one or more of the city hospitals. Principal actions later authorized Mr. Martindale to appoint a committee of 19 whose Chairman was Mr. Charles F. Adams. The Association was officially founded on March 3, 1902. Its objective was to provide for the relief of distressed teachers, the visitation of the sick, the burial of the dead, and especially to endow, own and control beds or rooms in hospitals for the use of the sick and disabled teachers, to invest and manage such funds. The Hospital Association of the Teachers of the Public Schools of Detroit changed its name to Detroit Teachers Hospital Association in 1941. The association was scheduled to dissolve on September 30, 1973 due to the lack of interest in the organization because of other board insurance plans that apparently were adequate for most teachers at that time, therefore, the last year that the association functioned was 1973. However, the dissolution of the association required more time than expected because the school-strike in the fall of 1973 delayed the disbursement of checks to members prorated on the number of years of membership from the remaining funds. By the fall of 1974 most members had received their checks; however, some checks were misplaced and lost and had to be duplicated taking more time and causing more expenses. Remaining funds after all benefit claims, fees, and expenses were paid were donated to the Wayne State University Medical School Long Term Loan Fund. The last meeting presenting the treasurer's final report was on May 28, 1975.</p>
