    <h3>Biographical/Historical note</h3>
    <p class="inv-1">Arthur Webster was an attorney and judge of the Wayne County Circuit Court from 1919-1957. He was born on a farm near Montrose, Iowa on April 15, 1871, the son of George and Cornelia M. (Allen) Webster. Webster attended public schools in southwestern Missouri before entering the University of Michigan for the study of law. He received his degree in 1892, and entered upon his professional career in Detroit, in the office of Corliss Leete &amp; Andrus. For five years he was assistant in the office of the corporation counsel and he subsequently engaged in private practice for a time. He then entered the office of the prosecuting attorney as assistant, and remained in that position for four years. After that position, Webster formed a partnership with Robert M. Chamberlain and Edwin Denby (who later became Secretary of the Navy under President Warren G. Harding), in the firm of Chamberlain, May, Denby &amp; Webster. This partner-ship was continued for eleven years, at the end of which time Webster was nominated for the circuit bench and was elected to the office, taking his seat on January 1, 1919, for a term of five years. On April 30, 1910, Arthur Webster married Laura Belle Russell of Toledo, Ohio, daughter of Charles Russell. They had two children. Judge Webster was a member of many legal associations, as well as the Detroit Boat Club, Detroit Athletic Club and Detroit Tennis Club. He was known as a man of `high and honorable principles and his work had won recognition from his professional colleagues and the public at large.</p>
