Miss Anne he sent Sarah such a beautiful locket with a picture in it' —`whose picture' says Anne —'his own?' —'Oh no ma'am, Mr. Henry Clay's cut little to fit it' — Need I tell you with what roars of laughter we greeted Caroline's account of Sarah's love affair.

Messr. Clay, Calhoun, Preston, King, Smith, Huntington and one or two others took part in the debate. The remarks of Mr. King of Alabama where [sic] rather uncorteus [sic] &amp; vindictive towards Clay which brought that gentleman upon the floor, absolutely using up King; Clay on setting [sic] down observed with some emphasis, that the remarks of the gentleman from Alabama, were unkind, not those of a gentleman (or something to that effect) and cowardly. Mr. King imputing probably [sic] a different meaning to the last part of the sentence, is said to have written a challenge to Clay, but I do not place much truth in it myself, I hope nothing of that kind will take place, the subject of the debate will be taken up again in the morning, the great guns of both parties are a going to 'throw themselves' on the occasion, and an angry discussion is expected. It looks rather dark about war, but the best policy is peace, and as Webster has the helm (Being now Secretary of State) he will undoubtedly do right without sacrificing [sic] his country in the least iota. The M'leod affair looks the worst at present, but hope it will, be finally, properly adjusted."</td>
